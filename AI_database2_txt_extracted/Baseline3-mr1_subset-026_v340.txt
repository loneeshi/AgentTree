1.3          Introduction

1.3.1.1      Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.

1.3.1.2   Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are
rethinking their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which
ATC systems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce
standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail
Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).

1.4       Advantages of an International Interoperable System

1.4.1.1      The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:
e Cross border interoperability.
e Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.
e Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.

e Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling
exploitation of maximum track capacity.

e The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.

e Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the
world market.

e Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic
management.

1.5        About this Document

1.5.1.1     The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System
(ETCS) from a technical point of view.

1.5.1.2    Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM's) over a transition period. They might be removed
in a future edition of the standard.

1.5.1.3      To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated
and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively

3.4.0                                                                             Chapter 1

trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level.

1.5.1.4   For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside
the scope of the SRS.

1.6       How to Read and Use the SRS

1.6.1.1    The SRS covers 8 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this
introduction.

1.6.1.2    All readers may need to refer to the Glossary of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET-
023).

1.7       Mandatory and Optional Requirements

1.7.1.1   This specification often offers multiple solutions on how to implement a specific
function. It therefore contains both mandatory and optional requirements. Mandatory
requirements are always referred to using the word “shall” where else optional
requirements are referred to using the word “may”.

1.7.1.2    The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all mandatory requirements,
with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control-Command and
Signalling TSI and in this SRS.

1.7.1.3     For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined
according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs.
In any case, the requirements of this SRS related to the implemented functions shall
be respected.

1.7.1.4    Notes are added to the specification in some parts for clarification. They however
never contain requirements.

1.7.1.5    Not specified requirements and solutions are only permitted as long as they do not
generate any interoperability problems.

1.8        Contents of the SRS

1.8.1.1    The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System
(ETCS) of ERTMS..

1.8.1.2     This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find
the relevant chapters.

1.8.2       Chapter 1:      Introduction

1.8.2.1     Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of
the SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter.

1.8.3       Chapter 2:      Basic System Description

1.8.3.1      Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure.
1.8.3.2      Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels.

1.8.3.3      Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements.

1.8.4        Chapter 3:       Principles

1.8.4.1     Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to
onboard and trackside subsystems.

1.8.4.2      The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.

1.8.5       Chapter 4:      Modes and Transitions

1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all
transitions between modes.

1.8.6        Chapter 5:       Procedures

1.8.6.1   Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for
interoperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS
onboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to
another.

1.8.7       Chapter 6:      Management of older System Versions

1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and lists the
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other
chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used by the
trackside subsystem.

1.8.8       Chapter 7:      ERTMS/ETCS Language

1.8.8.1     Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow
over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is
described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

2.4          System structure

2.4.1.1     Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system will have to be
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.

2.4.1.2      This defines two sub-systems, the on-board sub-system and the trackside sub-system.

2.4.1.3     The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of:
a) the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification;
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3),

d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no
interoperability requirement will be established.

Levels and transitions

Introduction

The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related
to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on-
board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on-board
equipment respectively.

Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their
strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance.
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.

For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is
used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines equipped with train
control system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.

Definitions

A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment always co-operates with the
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.

All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules.

ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:

e ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not
equipped with any train control system (ERTMS/ETCS or national system) or on a
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under
their supervision is currently not possible)

e ERTMS/ETCS Level NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line
equipped with a national system)

e ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally
Euroloop or Radio infill)

e ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on
a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and
Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside

e ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train
integrity supervision based on information received from the train)

It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for
example to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains
equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which
is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.

Levels 1, 2 and 3 are downwards compatible. This means that:
e alevel 3 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0, level 1 and level 2
e alevel 2 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0 and level 1

e alevel 1 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0
Note: Operation under level NTC is not part of the downward compatibility chain.

It is possible to transmit information not intended for ERTMS/ETCS but for other
systems over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels. This information is not used
by ERTMS/ETCS.

2.6.3      ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0
2.6.3.1      General description
2.6.3.1.1 Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or
national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not
possible (e.g. commissioning or on-board/trackside failed components).
2.6.3.1.2 In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and
therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give
movement authorities to the driver.
2.6.3.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.
2.6.3.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.
2.6.3.1.5 Level 0 uses no track-train transmission except Eurobalises to announce/command
level transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except
certain special commands are interpreted.
2.6.3.1.6 No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data
has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to
ERTMS/ETCS equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

ERTMS/ETCS Application Level NTC

General description

Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with
national train control and speed supervision systems.

Train control information generated trackside by the national train control system is
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national
system.

Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the
performance and functionality of the underlying systems.

Intentionally deleted.

The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying
national systems.

Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to
ERTMS/ETCS.

Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS _ track-train information except to
announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise
transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read.

The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying
national system. The active national system is indicated to the driver as part of that
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a
level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed.

A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level.

Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it,
in order to perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give
access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.

Intentionally deleted.

ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1

General description

ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as
an overlay on an underlying signalling system.

Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via
Eurobalises.

ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also
protects against overrun of the authority.

Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.

Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices.
The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information.

If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has
to observe the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be
permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release
speed.

Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.

Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi-continuous
infill is provided.

Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is
available and even at standstill.

Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the
operation without release speed.

3.3           Introduction

3.3.1       Scope and purpose

3.3.1.1    The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.

3.3.1.2     The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general
and functional terms.

3.3.1.3   The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification
number.

3.3.1.4     Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as

requirements.

3.4       Balise configuration and linking

3.4.1        Balise Configurations — Balise Group Definition

3.4.1.1      A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises.

3.4.1.2      In every balise shall at least be stored:
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise
b) The number of balises inside the group
c) The balise group identity.

3.4.1.3    The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the
group.
3.4.2        Balise Co-ordinate System

3.4.2.1.1_ Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system.

3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse
direction) is identified as balise group orientation.

3.4.2.2      Balise groups composed of two or more balises

3.4.2.2.1 The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group shall be given by the balise
number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group.

3.4.2.2.2 The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise
numbers.

3.4.2.3.2.3 The reference for the linking data shall be either a single balise group if a co-ordinate
system has been assigned to it before, or a balise group consisting of two or more
balises (with "inherent" co-ordinate system)

3.4.2.3.3 Level 2/3:

3.4.2.3.3.1 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot evaluate the orientation of the last
balise group detected, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is
available to identify the orientation of the co-ordinate system of this single balise group,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position by means of a position
report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG
and the “previous LRBG’, if any.

3.4.2.3.3.1.1 Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a
co-ordinate system to this single balise group.

3.4.2.3.3.2 When a single balise group is detected and the previous LRBG is known, the position
report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move from the
“previous LRBG” towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG): directional
information in the position report pointing in the same direction as the direction
reference shall be reported as “nominal”, otherwise as “reverse”.

3.4.2.3.3.3 If the “previous LRBG “ is not known, the “previous LRBG” and all directional
information of the position report based on two balise groups shall be reported as
“unknown”.

3.4.2.3.3.4 If a new single balise group (BG2), different from the current LRBG (BG1), becomes
LRBG while the running direction of the train is opposite to the running direction when
this current LRBG (BG1) was last passed, the “previous LRBG” and all directional

3.4.2.3.3.7 For single balise groups reported as LRBG and stored according to 3.6.2.2.2c,
awaiting an assignment of a co-ordinate system, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall be able to discriminate if a single balise has been reported more than
once and with different “previous LRBGs” to the RBC.

3.4.2.3.3.7.1 Note: For a single balise group reported as LRBG awaiting the assignment of a co-
ordinate system also the rules for LRBGs reported to the RBC (see 3.6.2.2.2) apply.

3.4.2.3.3.8 A co-ordinate system assignment received from trackside shall be rejected by the

3.4.3       Balise Information Types and Usage

3.4.3.1    In level 1, all information to the on-board system is given from balise groups or
additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units (see section 3.9). In level 2/3,
balise groups are mostly used for location information.

3.4.3.2     A balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either for nominal or for reverse
direction, or may contain information valid for both directions. In level 1, this
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5):

a) Non-infill
b) Intentionally deleted
c) Infill.
3.4.3.2.1 Intentionally deleted.
3.4.3.2.2 | Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise
group.

3.4.3.3     Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of
at least two balises shall be used.

3.4.4     Linking

3.4.4.1         Introduction

3.4.4.1.1 Aim of linking:

e To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action.

e To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise.
e To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4).

3.4.4.1.2 A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in
advance.

3.4.4.1.2.1 Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked
also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains
repositioning information marked accordingly.

3.4.4.2      Content of linking information

3.4.4.2.1 Linking information shall be composed of:
a) The identity of the linked balise group.

b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

SUBSET-026-3                                            System Requirements Specification                         Page 14/200

c) The accuracy of this location.
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises.

d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or
reverse).

e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the expected balise
group.

3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation
window of the furthest announced balise group.

3.4.4.2.2 Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information

3.4.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted.
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2.

3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known
because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise
group.

3.4.4.2.3 For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to
be used in case of data inconsistencies:

a) Train trip (Trip mode, see Chapter 4)
b) Command service brake

c) No reaction

For further details see section 3.16.2.

3.4.4.3      Unlinked Balise Groups

3.4.4.3.1. A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.

3.4.4.3.2 Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.
3.4.4.3.3 Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier.
3.4.4.4      Rules related to linking

3.4.4.4.1 When no linking information is used on-board, all balise groups shall be taken into
account.

3.4.4.4.2 | When linking information is used on-board, only balise groups marked as linked and
included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken
into account.

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

When linking information is used on-board and the expected balise group is referred in
the linking information with a balise group with ID “unknown”, a balise group marked as
linked shall only be taken into account if:

a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single
balise groups), AND

b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation,
AND

c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information.
The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in
the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from

e when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of
the balise group

until

e the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the
balise group

taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account.

Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group are
defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy.

3.4.4.4.3.2 Note: The interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the

expectation window.

In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location
shall start from the previously linked balise group.

The on-board equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise
only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking
information.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall
expect the next one announced in the linking information (if any) when:

a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window

b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1

Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check its linking consistency
and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the further next balise
group announced in the linking information.

3.5.1.1      Note: the following section refers to the behaviour of the user application interacting
with Euroradio protocols. How the messages are actually transported from the sender
to the receiver user application is not relevant for this description.

3.5.2          General

3.5.2.1     Each communication session managed by an entity shall allow the exchange of data
with only one other entity.

3.5.2.2    Note: in the following sections reference is made to safe radio connections, whose
definition and management is contained in Euroradio specification.

3.5.2.3    The information Initiation of a Communication Session and Version not Compatible

communication session.

3.5.3.2     A Radio Infill Unit (see section 3.9.3) shall never initiate a communication session.

3.5.3.3    Note: Only communication sessions between an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
and a trackside equipment (RBC or Radio Infill Unit) are considered here.

3.5.3.4      The on-board shall establish a communication session
a) At Start of Mission (only if level 2 or 3).
b) If ordered from trackside.

c) If a mode change, not considered as an End of Mission, has to be reported to the
RBC (only if level 2 or 3)

d) If the driver has manually changed the level to 2 or 3
e) When the train front reaches the end of an announced radio hole

f) When the previous communication session is considered as terminated due to loss
of safe radio connection (refer to 3.5.4.2.1)

g) When a Start of Mission procedure, during which no communication session could
be established, is completed in level 2 or 3

3.5.3.4.1 In respect of a), b), c), d) and e) of 3.5.3.4, the on-board shall not establish a new
communication session with an RBC/RIU in case a communication session is currently
being established or is already established with this RBC/RIU.

a) The on-board shall request the set-up of a safe radio connection with the trackside.
If this request is part of an on-going Start of Mission procedure, it shall be repeated
until successful or a defined number of times (see Appendix A3.1).

If this request is not part of an on-going Start of Mission procedure, it shall be
repeated until at least one of the following conditions is met:

e Safe radio connection is set up
e End of Mission is performed
e Order to terminate communication session is received from trackside

e The train passes a level transition border (from level 2/3 to level 0, NTC, 1) with
its front end.

Exception to 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.3: the on-board equipment shall not try to set up a new
safe radio connection and shall stop any on-going attempts if the train front is inside an
announced radio hole (see 3.12.1.3). The on-board equipment shall try to set it up
again when the train front reaches the end of the radio hole.

In case a message has to be sent during the loss of the safe radio connection, this
message shall be considered as sent.

Terminating a communication session

The termination of a communication session shall be initiated only by the on-board and
in the following cases:

a) If an order is received from trackside (RBC, RIU or balise groups) (see sections
3.5.3.5 and 3.5.3.6 concerning the content of the order).

b) If an error condition requiring the termination of the communication session is
detected on-board (e.g., not compatible system versions between on-board and
trackside).

c) The train is rejected by RBC during Start of Mission.
d) If the driver closes the desk during Start of Mission.

e) In case the train has reported having exited from an RBC area and no order to
terminate the session is received within a fixed waiting time (see Appendix A.3.1)
from the time the position report was sent, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall repeatedly send a position report with the fixed waiting time after each
repetition, until the order to terminate the session is received, or the defined number
of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within
the fixed waiting time after the last repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall terminate the communication session.

f) In case of communication session with an RIU: the Level 1 is left, or, an End of
Mission is executed.

In case a session is established, the on-board equipment shall terminate the
communication session according to the following steps:

a) The on-board equipment shall send a Termination of communication session
message.

b) As soon as this information is received, the trackside shall consider the
communication session terminated and send an acknowledgement to the on-board.

c) When the acknowledgement is received the on-board shall consider the
communication session terminated and request the release of the safe radio
connection with trackside.

3.5.6       Registering to the Radio Network

3.5.6.1     ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall order the registration of its connected Mobile
Terminal(s) to a Radio Network:

a) At power-up
b) Following driver entry of a new Radio Network identity (only if level 2 or 3)

c) If ordered from the trackside

3.5.6.2    When powered-off, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall memorize the last
received Radio Network identity (from trackside or from driver) and shall use it when
powered-up again.

3.5.6.3    If no Radio Network identity received from trackside or from driver could have been
memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or at
very first power-up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile
Terminal(s) to a default Radio Network.

3.5.6.3.1 Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default Radio Network identity (on-board
equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is
implementation dependent.

3.5.6.3.2 Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is powered-up in an area not covered by
the memorized or default Radio Network, attempts to register to this Radio Network will
be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt is
successful or a new Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from driver,
preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from registering to any unwanted Radio Network.

3.5.6.4    Note: for Radio Network identity data entry by driver during SoM, please refer to
chapter 5 (Procedure Start of Mission).

3.5.6.5     On reception of the trackside order, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately order the Radio Network registration of each Mobile Terminal that fulfils
the following conditions:
a) it is not yet registered to the ordered Radio Network, AND
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND

c) no safe radio connection is being set-up

3.5.6.6   If a Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the Radio Network ordered by
trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall initiate the Radio Network registration once communication session is
terminated and safe radio connection is released.

3.5.6.7    If no Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a Radio Network, any order to contact an
RBC or an RIU received from trackside shall be rejected by ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment.

Safe Radio Connection Indication

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the
safe radio connection. To that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe
radio connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set-Up failed’,
“Connection Up’.

In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use a “connection status”
timer (see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication
status “Connection Lost/Set-Up failed”.

Note: The purpose of the “connection status” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as
soon as the first request to set-up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is
sent:

a) for what regards the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4.

b) for what regards maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4

If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the requests to set-up
a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as
described in Table 1 according to the conditions in Table 2 (see section 4.6.1 for
details about the symbols).

For the case of an RBC/RBC transition, the safe radio connection indicated to the
driver shall switch from the indication status of the safe radio connection with the
Handing over RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following
conditions is met:

a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report directly to the
Accepting RBC with its maximum safe front end having passed the border, see
3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC),

b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the minimum
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, see 3.5.5.1 e) and 3.15.1.2.7.

Note: During an RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table
and a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each
RBC.

For the case of safe radio connection with RIU’s, the safe radio connection indicated to
the driver shall be the one related to the current infill area.

Location Principles, Train Position and Train Orientation

It shall be possible to identify:

a) Data that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level
transition orders, linking)

Figure 7: Route known by the train

3.6.1.3    The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to a
balise group, which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes:

e The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between
the LRBG and the front end of the train

e The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4)

e Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation
(see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding:

— the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG)
— the train orientation
— the train running direction

In case of an LRBG being a single balise group with no co-ordinate system
assigned, directional information is defined in reference to the pair of LRBG and
“previous LRBG’, see 3.4.2.3.3

e A list of LRBGs, which may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing
location dependent information (see 3.6.2.2.2 c)).

3.6.1.4      Balise groups, which are marked as unlinked, shall never be used as LRBG.

3.6.1.4.1 Justification: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may
not be known to the RBC.

3.6.1.5     If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e. the side of the
active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train
orientation shall be as when a cab was last active.

3.6.1.6     The “train orientation relative to LRBG” is defined as the train orientation related to the
orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either “nominal” or “reverse”.

3.6.1.6.1 Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction controller position.

3.6.2       Location of Data Transmitted to the On-Board Equipment

3.6.2.1      Data Transmitted by Balises

3.6.2.1.1 All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer to the location reference
and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs.

3.6.2.2      Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC

3.6.2.2.1_ All location and profile data transmitted from the RBC shall refer to the location
reference and orientation of the LRBG given in the same message.

3.6.2.2.2 For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met:

a) The on-board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference
when reporting its position to the RBC (in the following termed as LRBGong). Only
e balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking
information, if linking information is used on-board
or
e the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this
balise group was passed
shall be regarded.

b) The RBC shall use the last relevant balise group which was reported by the on-
board equipment as a reference (in the following termed as LRBGrsc). At a certain
moment LRBGpregc and LRBGong can be different.

c) The on-board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at
least eight LRBGong last reported to the RBC.

3.6.2.2.2.1 Exception to a): When on-board position is unknown or when position data has been
deleted during SoM procedure, the on-board equipment shall use an LRBG identifier
set to "unknown" until the onboard has validated its position again by passing a balise
group.

crossing direction shall be considered.

3.6.3.1.3.1 If the train position is unknown, data received from any transmission medium valid for
one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment.
Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).

3.6.3.2.2 With regard to Figure 12 the following applies to continuous profile data:
a) Value (n) shall be valid for distance (n+1)

b) For distance (1) the previously received data shall be used (in case of an SSP this
includes train length delay, refer to 3.11.3.1.3).

c) Distances shall be given as unsigned incremental values representing the distance
between value(n) and value(n-1).

d) The last value (n) transmitted shall be valid for an unlimited distance unless value(n)
represents a special "end of profile" value.

e) If distance (n+1) = 0 then the corresponding profile value n shall still be taken into
account.

With regard to Figure 12 the following shall apply to location data:

a) Distances shall be given as unsigned incremental values representing the distance
between value(n) and value(n-1).

b) For distance (1) the previously received data shall be used.

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.

According to Figure 12 the structure for non-continuous profile data shall allow to
contain multiple elements (value(n) for length(n)) inside the profile.

a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as
unsigned incremental values, each increment representing the distance between
starts of element (n) and element (n-1).

b) For distance (1) the previously received data (or initial data/default values, see
section 3.7) shall be used.

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.

d) Note: There is no relationship between length of element (n-1) and distance (n), i.e.,
elements may overlap.

It shall be possible for the RBC to shift the location reference, e.g., after a change of
train orientation or running direction.

Justification: Refer to Figure 13. To make it possible to shift the location reference if —
due to the location of the LRBG and the start location — distance (1) would become a
negative value.

Train Position Confidence Interval and Relocation

All location related information transmitted from trackside equipment shall be used by
the on-board equipment taking into account the confidence interval to the train
position, if required for safe operation.

The confidence interval to the train position shall refer to the distance to the LRBG and
shall take into account

a) On-board over-reading amount and under-reading amount (odometer accuracy plus
the error in detection of the balise group location reference)

b) The location accuracy of the LRBG.

Distance information received from trackside shall be evaluated on-board as nominal
information (without taking into account any tolerances).

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the
LRBG depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment until it is reset when another
balise group becomes the LRBG.

The value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information if
available, if not, by the corresponding National Value, or the corresponding Default
Value if the National Value is not applicable.

When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8)
location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received balise
group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be relocated by
subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the
location related information:

a) the distance between the reference balise group of the location related information
and the LRBG, retrieved from linking information if it is available and it includes both
the reference balise group and the LRBG, OR

b) in all other cases, the estimated travelled distance between the reference balise
group of the location related information and the LRBG.

Justification: it is always the trackside responsibility to provide linking in due course,
knowing this rule; if the location related information is to be used in situations where
linking is not provided (e.g. TSR transmitted by balise group marked as unlinked), the
trackside can include provisions, if deemed necessary, when engineering the distance
information.

interval is deleted:

a) the additional confidence interval shall be reset in relation to this new balise group

Geographical position reporting

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display, only on driver request, the
geographical position of the estimated front end of the train in relation to the track
kilometre. The display of the geographical position shall also be stopped on driver
request.

The resolution of the position indication shall be 1 metre (sufficient to allow the driver
to report the train position when communicating with the signalman).

When receiving new geographical position information (from radio or from balise
group), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall replace the currently stored

geographical position information (if any) by this new received one, continuing the on-
going geographical position calculation until at least one of the condition of 3.6.6.9
applies.

Geographical position information shall always use a balise group as geographical
position reference balise group and if needed an offset from that balise group. A
geographical position reference balise group shall be either:

a) part of the last reported balise groups memorised on-board, in case the information
is received from radio, OR

b) the balise group transmitting the information, in case the information is received
from balise group, OR

c) any balise group not yet passed at the time of reception of the information.

In case the information is received by radio and at least one of the announced
geographical position reference balise group(s) is part of the last reported balise
groups memorised on-board, the on-board equipment shall use the data related to the
most recently reported balise group.

From the currently stored geographical position information, the track kilometre
reference given for a geographical reference location shall become applicable if the
train has detected the related geographical reference balise group and has travelled
the offset distance from this reference balise group.

The announced and not applicable geographical references shall be deleted on-board
if the train changes orientation.

The distance travelled from the geographical reference location shall be taken into
account when calculating the geographical position.

In cases where the track kilometre is not incremental (jumps, changes in counting
direction, scaling error) the reported position might be wrong between the point of
irregularity and the next new reference.

In cases where single balise groups are used as a reference for geographical position
information and where no linking information is available (and therefore no orientation
can be assigned to the balise group), the on-board equipment shall ignore the
geographical position information related to these single balise groups.

The on-board equipment shall continue calculating the position from a track kilometre
reference (i.e. this track kilometre reference shall remain applicable) until:

a) anew track kilometre reference becomes applicable, OR
b) it is told not to do so, OR

c) the calculated geographical position becomes negative, OR

Movement authority

Characteristics of a MA

The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17:
Structure of an MA):

a) The End Of Authority (EOA) is the location to which the train is authorised to move.

SUBSET-026-3
3.4.0
12/05/14

System Requirements Specification                            Page 47/200
Chapter 3
Principles

--- Page 80 ---
ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

b) The Target Speed at the EOA is the permitted speed at the EOA; when the target
speed is not zero, the EOA is called the Limit of Authority (LOA). This target speed
can be time limited.

c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the EOA that can be
reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.

d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location
beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a
risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined
time.

e) Arelease speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity
of the EOA, when the target speed is zero. One release speed can be associated
with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release speed can also
be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4).

Rass]

The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.

e A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is
called the Section time-out.

e In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the
MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.

3.8.1.2    The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.

3.8.1.3     Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):

e the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to
fixed block principles)

e the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to
moving block principles)

e the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of
operation)

3.8.1.4     Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.

3.8.1.5    Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:

a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the EOA/LOA: When a signalman
requests a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching
train.

b) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.

c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the
overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that
the train has successfully stopped before its end of authority. If the overlap is still
unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.

Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance
to End Of Authority (with target speed equal to zero) a target speed higher than zero
can be given (speed at LOA, Limit Of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the EOA/LOA is long enough to brake the train
from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the
responsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.

MA request to the RBC

It shall be possible for the on-board equipment to request a new Movement Authority
from the RBC.

The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.

In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:

a) A defined time before the train reaches the pre-indication location (see section 3.13)
for the EOA/LOA assuming it is running at the warning speed.

b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap
timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires.

Regards to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggered when the train
front has passed the resulting location (regards a)/ time (regards b)

It shall be possible to define whether the MA request shall be repeated until a new MA
is received or not and if so, the time between each repetition.

The given data shall be valid until new MA request parameters are given from the
RBC.

In case no MA request parameters are stored on-board and following an MA request
no MA has been received, the request shall be repeated with a repetition cycle
according to a fixed value (see appendix).

In level 2/3: an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the driver selects start.

In level 2/3: An MA request shall be sent to the RBC when any part of the track
description is deleted according to A3.4, except for situations a, b, f, k.

Together with the MA request the on-board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s)
why the MA request is sent:

a) Start selection by driver,

b) Time before reaching pre-indication location for the EOA/LOA reached,
c) Time before a section timer or the LOA speed timer expires reached,

Note: If only one section is given in the MA it is regarded as the End Section.
The Section timer stop location shall be inside of the corresponding section.

Note: the End Section and Overlap timer start locations may be outside their
corresponding section. One example can be seen referring to figure 22c: An infill MA
towards a signal at stop will replace the previous End Section by a new short End
Section starting at the infill location reference and ending at the next main signal,
however the End Section and Overlap timer start locations still have to be consistent
with the Interlocking timer start locations. Another example is when a timer start
location is in rear of the LRBG.

In level 3, no time-outs shall be used.

Note: For level 3 functionality the split of responsibility between the RBC and the
Interlocking has to be considered. Time-out of routes and related overlap can not be
based on train position reports since the position report can be delayed compared to
the real position of the train. The route release and revocation of routes can not be
carried out by the interlocking until permitted by the RBC.

When an MA is transmitted by a balise group, the length of the first section shall refer
to the balise co-ordinate system of that balise group.

In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance
from the balise group at the main signal to the location of the main signal, i.e. the
distance to EOA is given. Where available, information concerning danger point and
overlap for this EOA may also be given.

3.8.3.7.1 Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the
signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise
group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to
the train.

3.8.3.8     In case the main signal is at danger in level 1, the on-board shall supervise the given
distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7) as the distance to EOA.

3.8.3.9     When an MA is transmitted by radio from the RBC, the length of the first section shall
refer to the balise co-ordinate system of the LRBG given in the same message.

3.8.3.10 It shall be possible to give the length of a section to any location in the track.

3.8.4       Use of the MA on board the train

3.8.4.1      End Section Time-Out

3.8.4.1.1 The End Section timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the End
Section timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.

3.8.4.1.2 When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:

a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train. Refer to
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board,
which shall be deleted accordingly;

b) if any, a non zero target speed value at the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero.

3.8.4.1.3. In case no End Section timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an
End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater than its time-out
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2.

3.8.4.1.3.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the
time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to
consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section
will soon be released by the Interlocking.

3.8.4.1.4. In case an End Section timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train,
the on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time-out value
with the value received with the new MA.

3.8.4.1.4.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer.

3.8.4.2.1 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section:
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise

group giving the MA.

3.8.4.2.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.

3.8.4.2.2 When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:

a) the EOA/LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked
section. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly;

b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply ;

c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero.
3.8.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted.

3.8.4.2.3 The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed
the associated Section timer stop location.

3.8.4.3      Time-out of the speed associated with the EOA/LOA

3.8.4.3.1 The on-board shall start a timer for the speed at the EOA/LOA:
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.

b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise
group giving the MA.

3.8.4.3.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.

3.8.4.3.2 When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the speed associated with the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of
Authority becomes an End of Authority and the SvL is defined on-board according to
3.8.4.5). Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.8.4.4      Time-out of Overlap

3.8.4.4.1_ The Overlap timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the Overlap timer
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end. The timer shall be
considered as started even if a time-out value “infinite” is given.

SUBSET-026-3                                              System Requirements Specification                           Page 54/200

When the Overlap timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:

a) the overlap information shall be deleted, i.e. the Supervised Location shall be
withdrawn to the Danger Point if there is any or else to the EOA. Refer to appendix
A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board, which
shall be deleted accordingly.

b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted
c) if any, anon zero target speed value at the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero.
If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board

shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.

In case no Overlap timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.

Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the
time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to
consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the Overlap will
soon be released by the Interlocking.

In case an Overlap timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA with
an Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-
board shall keep the Overlap timer running but replace the Overlap time-out value with
the value received with the new MA.

Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer.

Supervised Location

The Supervised Location (SvL) shall be defined on board as;

a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out).

b) if not, the Danger Point (if any).

c) if not, the End Of Authority.

As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board.
Infill MA (level 1 only)

An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA.

An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the on-board equipment is in FS or LS
mode.

The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main
signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in
advance by the infill device.

An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the linking information, regarding the
main signal balise group to which it refers, is available.

The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:

a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the
first encountered balise of the infill balise group.

b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop
message.

c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.

MA Update

A new MA shall replace a previously received MA in the following ways:

a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced
by the new data.

b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced
balise group at the next main signal shall be replaced.

Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1 and
the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6).

When an infill MA is received, the on-board shall start a new MA section at the infill
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1).

If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former
MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board,
which shall be deleted accordingly.

If a new MA defines an SvL while the on-board was supervising an LOA, this shall
always be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of
the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based
information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

It shall be possible to update the length of the current section by means of
repositioning information (see section 3.8.5.3).

3.8.5.2.1 Note: The current section need not be the end section.

3.8.5.2.2 Repositioning information contained in a balise group message shall only be evaluated
if linking information has announced a following balise group as unknown but
containing repositioning information.

3.8.5.2.3 A balise group message containing a movement authority shall not contain
repositioning information for the same direction.

3.8.5.2.3.1 Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA.

3.8.5.2.4 The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be
considered as an MA shortening by the on-board equipment.

3.8.6.1      It shall be possible to shorten a given MA using a special procedure between on-board
equipment and RBC. The procedure is as follows:

a) The RBC proposes a new MA with an EOA closer to the train than the current EOA,
optionally with a mode profile.

b) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check the train front end position
versus the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA.

e Ifitis in rear, the on-board equipment shall accept the new MA.

e If it is in advance, the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA
remains valid

c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision.

3.8.6.2     If the request from the RBC is granted by the on-board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the
exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.9      Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only)

3.9.1          General

3.9.1.1      It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on-board equipment using
a) Balise groups
b) Euroloops

c) Radio infill units.

3.9.1.1.1 Note: If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes
infill information, those devices are also identified as infill devices.

3.9.1.2   The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of
transmission media.

3.9.1.3     If the on-board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested
by the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by
the on-board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously
received information.

3.9.1.4     Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already
covered in previous chapters).

3.9.2        Infill by loop

3.9.2.1     An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the
end of a loop. When receiving this information, the on-board equipment knows that it is
entering/leaving a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it shall be
possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop.

3.9.2.2     Balise groups shall be used as EOLMs. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM
information to the passing train.

3.9.2.3     EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The general
rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

--- Page 97 ---
ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

3.9.2.4      EOLM information might be contained in a balise group that contains other information.
3.9.2.5      The EOLM shall send the identity of the announced loop.

3.9.2.6     The on-board shall only accept information coming from the loop with the announced
identity.

3.9.2.7      Deleted.
3.9.2.8      Deleted.

3.9.2.9   The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for
reception of the loop information:

e Loop identity used to identify the loop.
e Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop telegrams.

e Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where
on loop messages can be received.

e Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be
received.

e Indicator telling the on-board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or
reverse to the orientation of the announcing EOLM.

3.9.2.10 | The on-board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing
the EOLM.

3.9.2.11 When the on-board equipment reads the next main signal balise group or when it
detects that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information
possibly received from the loop shall be ignored.

3.9.2.12 The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for
diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop
telegrams to specific locations.

3.9.3      Infill by radio

3.9.3.1    In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on-board equipment orders to
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.

3.9.3.2     The orders shall be sent via balise groups or via Radio Infill units.

3.9.3.3      The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored:
a) Intentionally deleted.

b) If the on-board equipment does not include radio.

3.9.3.4   If the on-board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be
established using the same protocols and interfaces as for Level 2/3 operations.

If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via balise
groups is received by an on-board equipment, connected with another radio infill
unit(s), two cases may arise:

Case 1: the on-board can handle only one communication session at a time. In this
case, the onboard shall (unless §3.9.3.5.1.1 applies):

a) terminate the existing communication session at the location indicated in the order

b) establish a communication session with the RIU indicated in the order as soon as
action a) is completed.

The order shall be ignored in case it refers to an RIU with which a session is currently
being established or is already established.

Case 2: the on-board can handle more than one communication session at a time. In
this case, at the location indicated in the order the on-board shall:

a) terminate any communication session existing with RIU(s) not indicated in the order

b) as soon as a new communication session can be handled, establish a
communication session with the RIU indicated in the order, unless currently being
established or already established with the said RIU.

If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via Radio
Infill unit is received by an on-board equipment:

a) If the on-board can handle only one communication session, the order shall be
ignored.

b) If the on-board can handle two communication sessions simultaneously and only
one session is ongoing, the existing communication session shall be maintained
and the new one shall be established.

c) If the on-board can handle two communication sessions simultaneously and two
sessions are ongoing, then the communication session related to the current infill
area shall be maintained, the other one shall be terminated and the new one shall
be established.

A Radio Infill Unit shall not initiate a communication session with an on-board
equipment.

The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall
be sent together with the following radio infill area information:

a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the
order).Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location
marks the beginning of the Radio Infill Area.

b) Next main signal balise group identifier (ignored by the on-board if the action is
Terminate communication session).Note: the reference location of this balise group
marks the end of the Radio Infill Area.

The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units
(see 3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information.

The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the
operational level of the on-board i.e. the information in the balise group shall be taken
into account as usual in level 1.

The on-board equipment shall inform the radio infill unit

a) As soon as the location indicated in the order sent via balise groups is passed (i.e.
entry of the train in the infill area)

b) As soon as the next main signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise
groups is read or the on-board equipment detects that it was missed.

The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on-board equipment shall include

a

b

rain identity (ETCS-ID of the on-board equipment)

Position report

c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group
d) Time stamp

Justification:

a

b

The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages

The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infill unit to
identify safely where the train is going, even in the case of a points area

As soon as the radio infill unit is informed that a train has entered an infill area under
its responsibility, it shall

a) Terminate a possible previous sending of infill information to the on-board
equipment, AND

b) Send cyclically the infill information corresponding to the message currently sent by
the next main signal balise group indicated in the information from the on-board
equipment.

Justification: case a) refers to the possibility that a report from the on-board equipment,
after having passed the previous main signal, was lost.

Note: A Radio infill unit may manage several signals, thus several Radio Infill Areas

data, not their acknowledgement or their revocation.

3.10.1.1.1 Justification: In case of hazardous events, it is possible to use high priority data in the
radio connection between RBC and on-board equipment to get a quick reaction.

3.10.1.2 An emergency message shall contain an identifier decided by the trackside.

location, referred to the LRBG. In case, when receiving this message

e the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the
emergency stop message shall be rejected and the RBC shall be informed.

e the train has not yet passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the

Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients

Introduction

The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions and considering the End of Authority/Limit Of
Authority.

A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS
level.

Definition of Static Speed Restriction

Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment.

There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)

b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)

c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)

d) Maximum Train Speed

e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)

f) Mode related Speed Restriction.

g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Subset-035)

h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset-035)

i) Level Crossing speed restriction (LX SR)

j) Override function related Speed Restriction

Static Speed Profile (SSP)

The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed,
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges.

The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent.
The relationship between track and train characteristics determines the individual
Static Speed Profile for each train.

It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit
specified for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element.

3.11.3.2.1 It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories.

3.11.3.2.1.1       The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:

a) The “Cant Deficiency’ SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category.

b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories
corresponding to the other international train categories

3.11.3.2.1.2    Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the
following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of
specific SSP categories.

3.11.3.2.2 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall:

a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default “Cant

3.11.4.2.1 Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category can be
applicable to the same distance.

3.11.4.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider the most restrictive speed
restriction that is associated with any axle load category lower than, or equal to that of
the train.

3.11.4.4 For trains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given
in the profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not consider any speed
restriction due to axle load.

3.11.4.5 ”The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be “no restriction due to axle load”.

3.11.5.5 Each Temporary Speed Restriction shall have an identity to make it possible to revoke
the Temporary Speed Restriction using its identity. The speed restriction shall be
revoked immediately when revocation is received from trackside, without delay for the

3.11.5.8 | Temporary Speed Restrictions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.

3.11.5.9 If the on-board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the
same identity as an already received TSR, the new Temporary Speed Restriction shall
replace the previous one, except when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified
as non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR.

occurs:
e the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is
terminated, OR

e incase of RBC/RBC handover, the train front end crosses the RBC/RBC border.
3.11.5.15 Note: this inhibition may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling applications

Override function related Speed Restriction

While the “override” function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value)
shall be taken into account.

Speed restriction to ensure permitted braking distance

It shall be possible for trackside to request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to
calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance given by trackside.

The order shall be given by means of a non-continuous profile defining:
e The start and end location for the speed restriction
e The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculate the speed restriction value

e Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or
Emergency Brake

e Asingle gradient value applicable for the calculation

The speed restriction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be re-
calculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed
restriction changes.

The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
take into account that:

e The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value
according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3.

e The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but without considering
the adhesion profiles, the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track
conditions related to powerless section given by trackside.

e The expected deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without
considering the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions
related to powerless section given by trackside.

e The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake
Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches zero
speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.

e If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also calculate a Service Brake
Deceleration (SBD) curve based on the expected deceleration and that reaches
zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.

e The estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”.

e If not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed, as defined in
SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: V_deltaOPBD = f,,(V_PBD + dV_EBI(V_PBD)) if the

permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake;
V_deltaOPBD = f4,(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD)) if the permitted braking distance is
to be achieved with the service brake.

e The train will travel a distance from the last encountered balise of a group that
provides restrictive information until initiating the brake command. This travelled
distance shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed considering a
processing delay (T41) equal to SUBSET-041 § 5.2.1.1.

e Regardless of how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see
3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the service
brake feedback was not implemented.

e Regardless of how the traction cut-off interface is actually configured (see
3.13.2.2.8), T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut-off was
not implemented.

Note: Knowing how the PBD speed restriction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the appropriate
permitted braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the brake command
in due time when encountering a further balise group providing restrictive information.
In other words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisions based on
the characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information e.g. distances
between balises in that group with regards to validity direction of transmitted
information and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location.

Note: If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, it is the
responsibility of the trackside to also consider an estimation of the on-board over-
reading and under-reading amounts at the time the brake commana is initiated in order
to lower the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI
supervision limit.

Note: Throughout the following formulas, all the distances marked with “d” (lower case)
are counted from a single arbitrary reference location.

If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall seek the PBD speed restriction value
(V_PBD) which satisfies the two following inequalities. The resulting value shall then
be rounded down to the next lower multiple of 5km/h:

The following actions shall be performed at receiving a track condition:

a) Indicate on DMI (see chapter 5, procedure “Indication of track conditions”), except
“Station platforms”, “Change of allowed current consumption” and “Big metal
masses”.

b) Send information with the remaining distance to an ERTMS/ETCS external function,
with the exception of big metal mass track condition, sound horn track condition,
non stopping area, tunnel stopping area and supervision of radio transmission which
are handled inside the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

Note: Whether some information shall be filtered (not shown to the driver or not sent to
an ERTMS/ETCS external function) is outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.

Note: The ERTMS/ETCS external function must be able to handle new track condition
of the same type as previously received and covering the same distance.

The train is permitted to run without any track condition information given from the
trackside. The initial state shall then be used by the on-board equipment.

Route Suitability

Route suitability data defines which values concerning loading gauge, traction system
and axle load category a train must meet to be allowed to enter the route.

The route suitability data is sent as location data from the trackside when needed.

On reception of route suitability data, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
compare it with the corresponding Train Data stored on-board. Unsuitability exists if:

a) The loading gauge profile of the train is not included in the list of loading gauges
accepted by trackside

b) The list of traction systems accepted by the engine does not include the one
received from trackside

c) The axle load category of the train is higher than the permitted one received from
trackside

ERTMS/ETCS system.

The train is permitted to run without any route suitability data given from the track. No
default values shall be used or supervised by the on-board equipment, i.e. the initial
state is that no restrictions related to route suitability exists.

Text Transmission

General Rules

It shall be possible to transmit information to be displayed to the driver from the
trackside to the on-board equipment in the form of text messages.

Text messages shall always be supplemented by conditions on when and where they
are to be displayed, and whether any acknowledgement is requested from the driver.
These parameters shall be transmitted individually for each message.

Text messages and the supplementary information shall always be transmitted in one
message.

Text messages can contain the text to be displayed in plain text or a number selecting
a fixed message.

Note: In case of plain text messages the trackside selects the language in which
the message is displayed.

Mode profile

The Mode Profile can request On Sight mode, Limited Supervision mode and Shunting
mode.

For OS and LS mode the mode profile shall define the entry and the length of the On
Sight/Limited Supervision area. For SH mode the mode profile only defines the entry
location to SH mode, any length given shall be ignored by the on-board.

On reception of a new MA (with or without Mode Profile) the on-board equipment shall
delete the currently supervised Mode Profile.

Exception: When receiving a new MA by infill, any currently supervised Mode Profile
shall be deleted only beyond the reference location of the infill information.

In case the mode profile information for shunting is overwritten by a new shunting
profile, before the on-board equipment switches to SH mode, a previous list of balise
groups for SH area shall be deleted or replaced by a new list of balise groups for SH
area.

The beginning of the Mode Profile relates to the max safe front end of the train.

The end of the mode profile relates to the min safe front end of the train.

Level Crossings

It shall be possible for trackside to inform the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
about the conditions under which a Level Crossing (LX) must be passed.

Each Level Crossing shall have an identity, so that all LX information shall be
independent of each other. This means that an individual LX information shall not
affect, nor be affected by, any other individual LX information.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a new LX information with the same
identity as an already received LX information, the new LX information shall replace
the previous one.

Level Crossing information shall be given as profile data, corresponding to the LX start
location and the length of the LX area.

Level Crossing information shall indicate whether the LX is protected or not.

In case the LX is not protected, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be informed:
a) at which speed the LX is allowed to be passed

b) whether the stopping of the train in rear of the LX start location is required or not

In case stopping in rear of the non protected LX is required, a stopping area in rear of
the LX start location shall be defined.

3.13      Speed and distance monitoring

3.13.1     Introduction

3.13.1.1 The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus
its position, in order to assure that the train remains within the given speed and
distance limits.

3.13.1.1.1 Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on-board can only assure this when
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:
e Brake system of the train functions as specified
e wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration
e Brake characteristics (and other Train Data) are correctly entered into the on-board

(automatic or by driver)

3.13.1.2 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes
them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released.
However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake
command is an implementation issue.

3.13.1.3 Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements contributing to the speed and
distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the
following chapters.

3.13.2.1.2 However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore
incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring.

3.13.2.1.3 The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are
required for reference conditions set by trackside.

3.13.2.2 Train related inputs
3.13.2.2.1 Introduction

3.13.2.2.1.1 The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are:
a) Traction model

b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake
percentage

c) Brake position

d) Special brakes

e) Service brake interface

f) Traction cut-off interface

g) On-board correction factors

h) Nominal rotating mass

i) Train length

j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring

k) Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed)

3.13.2.2.1.2 All train related inputs except the fixed values are acquired as Train Data (see
3.18.3.2 items b) c) and d)).

3.13.2.2.1.3 The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train
Data, unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model
is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits).

3.13.2.2.2 Traction model

3.13.2.2.2.1_ The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. It
shall describe the time delay T_traction_cut_off from the traction cut-off command by
the on-board (t0) to the moment the acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is
guaranteed to be zero (t1). The estimated acceleration value of the train shall be
considered during this time delay.

3.13.2.2.2.2 Note: The current value of A_traction is not known directly by the on-board. It is
implicitly known as a contribution to the estimated acceleration, together with the
acceleration due to gradient.

3.13.2.2.3 Braking Models

3.13.2.2.3.1 Speed Dependent Deceleration
3.13.2.2.3.1.1 The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed.

3.13.2.2.3.1.2 It shall be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent
deceleration model.

3.13.2.2.3.1.3 Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as
follows:
e A_brake = AD_O when 0 § speed s V1
e A_brake = AD_1 when V1 < speed s V2
e A_brake = AD_2 when V2 < speed s V3
e A_brake = AD_3 when V3 < speed

3.13.2.2.3.1.4 The last step of A_brake(V) shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it
has no upper speed limit.

3.13.2.2.3.1.5 The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full
in Figure 31)

3.13.2.2.3.1.6 The model shall be used for the emergency brake nominal deceleration
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V))
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).

3.13.2.2.3.1.7 It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of
A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V) for each combination of use of
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake.

3.13.2.2.3.1.8 Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence
of a specific brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the
choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for
A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an
ETCS implementation issue.

3.13.2.2.3.1.9 It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of
A_brake_normal_service(V):

a) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G”

b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight
train in P”

3.13.2.2.3.1.10 A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full
service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0):

If A_brake_service(V = 0) < A_SB01

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)
if A_SBO1 < A_brake_service(V = 0) < A_SB12

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_1(V)
if A_SB12 < A_brake_service (V = 0)

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V)

3.13.2.2.3.1.11 Note: the two pivot values A_SBO1 and A_SB12 are part of the
A_brake_normal_service model, i.e. they are train related input data for the speed and
distance monitoring function.

3.13.2.2.3.2 Brake build up time

SUBSET-026-3                                              System Requirements Specification                           Page 91/200

3.13.2.2.3.2.1 The deceleration A_brake is not available immediately after the on-board
commands the brake. There is a time lag between brake command and the start of the
brake force build-up. There is also time needed to build up the full brake force.

3.13.2.2.3.2.2 The model for the brake build up time shall be given as a step function as explained
in Figure 31.

Figure 31: Brake Build Up Time Model

3.13.2.2.3.2.3 In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined:

a) T_brake_react (t0...t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on-
board and the moment the brake force starts to build up.

b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the
zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached.

c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time.

3.13.2.2.3.2.4 The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase.

3.13.2.2.3.2.5 This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service).

3.13.2.2.3.2.6 Note: The equivalent brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning
of the build-up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is
compensated by a higher deceleration.

3.13.2.2.3.2.7 Note: T_brake_react and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for
completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the
speed and distance monitoring function.

3.13.2.2.3.2.8 lt shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency and
T_brake_service for each combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current
brake, magnetic shoe brake and Ep brake.

3.13.2.2.3.2.9 Note: Individual values of T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service may be equal,
thereby avoiding the influence of a specific brake. However, the choice to take into
account or not the contribution of a specific brake for T_brake_emergency and
T_brake_service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.

3.13.2.2.3.2.10 Note: In general, T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service are determined by
the pneumatic brake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the
Electro-pneumatic brake system is used, it is possible that T_brake_emergency and
T_brake_service are determined by another special brake.

3.13.2.2.4 Brake Position
3.13.2.2.4.1 The brake position shall be set to one of the following three values:
a) Passenger train in P
b) Freight train in P
c) Freight train in G
3.13.2.2.4.2 Note: The brake position defines the behaviour of the brake for specific train types.
3.13.2.2.5 Brake Percentage

3.13.2.2.5.1 If the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is
applicable (see 3.13.3.2), they are used to derive A_brake_emergency(V),
A_brake_service(V), T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service.

3.13.2.2.5.2 Note: the conversion model has been designed assuming that all the provisions laid
down in the UIC leaflet 544-1, with the exception of sections 9.1.2 and 9.2.2, apply for
the acquired brake percentage.

3.13.2.2.6.3 When the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is
applicable, A_brake_emergency(V), T_brake_emergency and A_brake_service(V)
shall not be influenced by the status of a special brake. However, the conversion
model offers the possibility that T_brake_service can be affected by the status of the
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or Ep brake (see A.3.9).

3.13.2.2.6.4 The on-board equipment shall be configured to define whether it is allowed to take
into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, which is independent from
wheel/rail adhesion, for the selection of the maximum emergency brake deceleration
under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.6.2.1.6).

3.13.2.2.6.5 Note: the choice to set to “allowed” the contribution of such special/additional brake
in the selection of the maximum emergency braking effort, is rolling stock dependent.

3.13.2.2.6.6 If it is allowed to take into account the contribution of a special/additional brake,
which is independent from wheel/rail adhesion, the speed and monitoring function shall
take into account the status “active” or “not active” of the special/additional brake to
select the appropriate National Value under reduced adhesion conditions (see
3.13.2.3.7.7).

3.13.2.2.7 Service brake interface

3.13.2.2.7.1_ The on-board shall be configured to define whether the service brake command is
implemented or not, i.e. whether a service brake interface is implemented to command
a full service brake effort.

3.13.2.2.7.2 The on-board shall be configured to define whether the service brake feedback is
implemented or not, i.e. whether it is able to acquire from the service brake interface
the information that the service brake is currently applied (e.g. from the main brake
pipe pressure or brake cylinder pressure).

3.13.2.2.8 Traction cut-off interface

3.13.2.2.8.1 The on-board shall be configured to define whether the traction cut-off command is
implemented, i.e. whether the interface to the traction system is implemented or not.

3.13.2.2.9 On-board Correction Factors

3.13.2.2.9.1 Correction factors for the emergency deceleration

3.13.2.2.9.1.1 If the braking models are captured as Train Data, rolling stock correction factors
shall be defined in the ETCS on-board equipment. If the brake percentage is captured
as Train Data and the conversion model is used (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits), no
rolling stock correction factor shall apply.

3.13.2.2.9.1.2 For each defined individual speed dependent deceleration model of

brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake), one set of rolling stock

correction factors Kdry_rst(V, EBCL) and Kwet_rst(V) shall be defined in the on-board
equipment.

3.13.2.2.9.1.3 For a given confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration (EBCL), the
rolling stock correction factor Kdry_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of speed,
with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V).

3.13.2.2.9.1.4 The confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration represents the
probability of the following individual event: the rolling stock emergency brake
subsystem of the train does ensure a deceleration at least equal to
A_brake_emergency(V) * Kdry_rst(V), when the emergency brake is commanded on
dry rails.

3.13.2.2.9.1.5 The rolling stock correction factor Kwet_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of
speed, with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V). It represents the
loss of deceleration with regards to emergency braking on dry rails, when the
emergency brake is commanded on wet rails, according to wheel/rail adhesion
reference conditions.

3.13.2.2.9.2 Correction factor for gradient on normal service deceleration

3.13.2.2.9.2.1 The speed dependent correction factors for gradient on the normal service brake,
Kn+(V) and Kn-(V), shall be given as step functions in the range from 0 to 10 m/s2.

3.13.2.2.9.2.2 It shall be possible to define up to five steps for Kn+(V) and for Kn-(V), respectively.

e Kn=Kn_0 when 0 s speed s V1

3.13.2.2.10.1 It shall be possible to define the nominal rotating mass to be used for compensating
the gradient, instead of the two related fixed values defined in A3.1.

3.13.2.2.11 Train length

3.13.2.2.11.1 The speed and distance monitoring shall take into account the train length acquired
as part of Train Data (see section 3.18.3).

3.13.2.2.12 Fixed values

3.13.2.2.12.1 The speed and distance monitoring shall take into account the fixed values defined
in A3.1 that are related to speed and distance monitoring.

3.13.2.2.13 Maximum train speed

3.13.2.2.13.1 The speed and distance monitoring shall take into account the maximum train
speed defined as part of Train Data (see section 3.18.3).

3.13.2.3.1 Introduction

3.13.2.3.1.1 The trackside related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring
are:

a) Trackside related speed restrictions

b) Gradients

c) Track conditions related to brake inhibition

d) Track conditions related to powerless section

e) Reduced adhesion conditions

f) Specific speed and distance limits (e.g. EOA/SvL)

g) National Values
3.13.2.3.2 Trackside related speed restrictions

3.13.2.3.2.1 The speed and distance monitoring shall take into account the trackside related
speed restrictions composed of all speed restrictions mentioned in 3.11.2 except the
maximum train speed.

Conversion Models

Introduction

For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre-
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models
are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake
percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.

Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS
specifications.

Applicability of the conversion models

The conversion models shall be used by the on-board equipment if the brake
percentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the
brake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the
conversion models:

a) 0< V < 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h
b) 30 <A $ 250, where A is the brake percentage in %

c) 0s LsLmax, where L is the train length in m and where Lmax = 900 m if the brake
position is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500 m if the brake position is “Freight
train in P” or “Freight train in G”

Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model.

For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable,
which means that braking models (i.e. pre-programmed deceleration profiles and
brake build up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function.

Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any location between the current
(actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35).

Rotating mass

The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see
Figure 35).

Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating
mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy
added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion.
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same
train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear
forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for
the train without rotating mass.

3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it

is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.

3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used:

a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:

e Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)

e Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)
b) If M_rotating_nom is known:

e Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)

e Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)
Legend:

A_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient

g = 9.81 m/s? - acceleration of gravity in m/s?

grad = gradient values in % (positive = uphill)

M_rotating_nom = nominal rotating mass (part of train data) as a percentage of the
total train weight

M_rotating_max = maximum possible rotating mass (see A3.1) as a percentage of the
total train weight
M_rotating_min = minimum possible rotating mass (see A3.1) as a percentage of the
total train weight

Determination of locations without special brake contribution and with
reduced adhesion conditions

As long as it uses a track condition profile given by trackside, the on-board shall
consider locations without special brake contribution over a distance going from the
start location of the profile to the foot of the deceleration curve (EBD, SBD or GUI, see
sections 3.13.8.3, 3.13.8.4 and 3.13.8.5).

If the status of a special brake is “not active”, all locations shall be considered without
the contribution of this special brake.

Note: in such case, a track condition profile implying the inhibition of this special brake
will have no effect.

From the adhesion profile given by trackside, the on-board shall consider locations with
reduced adhesion conditions over a distance going from the start location of the profile
to the location derived by adding the train length to the end location of the profile.

When slippery rail is selected by the driver, all locations shall be considered with
reduced adhesion conditions.

The speed and distance monitoring shall use, as resulting reduced adhesion
conditions, the most restrictive value of the adhesion conditions selected by the driver
and the adhesion conditions calculated from the trackside profile.

built of is changed.

3.13.8     Determination of targets and brake deceleration curves

3.13.8.1 Introduction

3.13.8.1.1 A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train must
decelerate before reaching the target location.

3.13.8.1.2 For that purpose, the on-board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related
to the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections
3.13.6.2.1, 3.13.6.3.1and 3.13.6.4.

3.13.8.1.3 These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration
curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of
parabola, each one being based on one of the speed/distance dependent deceleration
values (see Figure 38).

3.13.8.2 Determination of the supervised targets
3.13.8.2.1 The on-board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the
following types of target:

a) the locations corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP (if any), which are in
advance of the max safe front end of the train

b) the Limit of Authority (LOA), if the target speed at the EOA/LOA is not equal to zero

c) the End of Authority (EOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL), if the target speed at
the EOA is equal to zero

d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff
Responsible, with a target speed zero

3.13.8.2.1.1 Note: depending on the information received from trackside and the position of the
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty.

3.13.8.2.2 The list of supervised targets shall be re-evaluated when any of the elements it is built
of is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on-board, EOA and/or
SvL temporarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored
information in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)).

3.13.8.2.3 A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the
list of supervised targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the
target location.

3.13.8.3.1 If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on-board shall calculate an EBD
curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d), that crosses the ceiling speed EBI
supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2) at the target location, and that extends up to the
location where the target speed is reached (EBD foot).

Responsible, the on-board shall calculate an Emergency Brake Deceleration (EBD)
curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d) and that reaches zero speed at this

3.13.8.5.2 If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on-board shall calculate a guidance

deceleration A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where
the GUI speed is equal to the target speed) shall be:

The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an
emergency brake intervention by maintaining the speed of the train within the

appropriate limits.

Figure 46: Braking to target supervision limits from SBD curve

3.13.9.3.1.4 No specific supervision limit is calculated from the GUI curve: it is only used to
adjust the Permitted speed (P) supervision limit, which is obtained either from the EBD
or the SBD curve.

speed under reading amount (V_ura) at the moment when the calculation is made:
V_deltaO = V_ura (see Figure 45).

3.13.9.3.2.2 The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application
of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts:

a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction

b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem

3.13.9.3.2.3 The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows:
a) when the traction cut-off is implemented:
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0).
b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off
3.13.9.3.2.4 Note: When the traction cut-off is implemented, the traction cut-off command is
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the

equation above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from
the EBD.

3.13.9.3.2.5 T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.4.

3.13.9.3.2.6 The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MAX(T_be -
T_traction ; 0).

3.13.9.3.2.7 Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless
included to make the specifications complete.

3.13.9.3.2.8 During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one measured at
the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values.

3.13.9.3.2.9 If T_be > T_traction, the estimated acceleration during T_berem (A_est2) shall be
the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values
between 0 and +0.4m/s’.

3.13.9.3.2.10 The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed
between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application of the braking effort
is reached shall be derived as follows (see Figure 45):

3.13.9.3.3.1 For the EOA, the on-board shall calculate the location of the SBI supervision limit

3.13.9.3.3.3 If the service brake command is available for use and the service brake feedback is
not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs.

3.13.9.3.3.4 If both the service brake command and the service brake feedback are available for
use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be firstly set to T_bs. When the service brake is used by
the driver, they shall then be reduced progressively and possibly locked to the
respective fixed values of Os and T_bs2_locked, until the target location is passed or
until the target speed monitoring is left; they are then reset again to T_bs (see detailed
algorithm in Appendix A3.10).

3.13.9.3.3.4.1 In case T_bs < T_bs2_locked then T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs2_locked.

3.13.9.3.3.5 If the service brake command is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be set
to zero.

3.13.9.3.3.6 Note: The values T_bs1 and T_bs2 = Os are defined to achieve the maximum
performance when service brake command is not used.

3.13.9.3.3.8.1 Note: the re-use of the same distance travelled and speed increase between the
SBI2 supervision limit and the EBD, as for the estimated speed (see Figure 48), leads
to an overestimation/underestimation of the SBI2 speed to be displayed to the driver.
This simplification, which avoids the need of an iterated calculation, is however

supervision limits are clearly separated and do not affect each other. In this way it is
clear that the warning is not part of the critical performance interval.

To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication,
giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake.

Release speed supervision limits

The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA.
The EBI supervision limit shall be equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, |
supervision limit associated to the release speed.

Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance.
The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the
balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the
EOA to the Supervised Location.

With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR

c) Instruct the on-board to use the national value.

In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release
speed shall be supervised.

Note: When the release speed is given as a fixed value from trackside, the
ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopping the train in rear of the
Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure
manager to set the appropriate release speed with regard to the risk of passing the
Supervised Location.

The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed
value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SBI supervision limit among the SBI1
related to EOA, the SBI2 related to SvL and, when the Release Speed is calculated
on-board, the SBI2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), if any, between the
Trip location related to the EOA and the SvL, calculated for the Release Speed value,
taking into account the following assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”

b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the release speed, as defined
in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: V_deltaOrs = f4,(V_release)

3.13.9.4.8.2.1 Note: The above formulas are intended to prevent the calculated release speed
from fluctuating, according to the distance, speed and acceleration measurements. It
allows calculating the release speed only once, for a given on-board reference
location, unless

e the distance confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based on
the assumption that the whole distance between the current on-board
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET-041
odometer performance values and without any update of the on-board
reference location, or

e the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET-041
performance value

Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), the release
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is
acceptable from an operational point of view.

3.13.9.4.8.2.2 Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterative algorithm) to compute the release speed is
an implementation issue.

3.13.9.4.9 If the release speed (Figure 52 box 1 gives an example when it is calculated on-board)
exceeds the MRSP anywhere in the area (Figure 52 box 2) delimited on one side by
the presumed start location of the Release speed monitoring and on the other side by
the trip location related to the EOA, the on-board shall use as a fixed release speed
(Figure 52 box 4) the most restrictive value of the MRSP (Figure 52 box 3) within this
area, and shall re-evaluate the start location of the Release speed monitoring
accordingly.

Pre-indication location

The purpose of the pre-indication is to inform the driver that he is approaching an area
where he has to operate the service brake in order to brake to a target. The pre-
indication is used to switch from ceiling speed monitoring to target speed monitoring.

For an EBD based target, the on-board shall calculate the pre-indication location as
follows.

Starting from the first element of the MRSP (i.e. from the start location of the on-board
stored track description), the on-board shall calculate the location of the Indication
supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the
following assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”

b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed
measurement shall be set to a value, calculated from the speed of the MRSP
element, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: V_deltaOind = f4,(V_MRSP-n)

c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have any effect: T_bstind
and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use,
otherwise they shall be set to “zero”. T_tractionind and T_beremind shall be defined
as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem by substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind

To calculate the EBI supervision limit, the same formulas defined above with V_est,
T_traction, T_berem and V_deltaO shall be applied, by substituting V_est with
V_MRSP-n, T_traction with T_tractionind, T_berem with T_beremind and V_deltaO
with V_deltaOind.

3.13.9.5.10 If, in exceptional situation (e.g. after a shortening of MA), the EBD, SBD or GUI speed
at the start location of the MRSP is lower than the speed of the first element of the

be considered as immediately fulfilled.

3.13.9.5.11 Note 1: For ergonomic reasons, the location of a pre-indication is independent of the
estimated speed. If the pre-indication would be derived from an EBD or SBD curve
according to the estimated speed, then when the train is running at low speed the
driver would see the permitted speed already decrease while the DMI is still in ceiling
speed display. That is not consistent for the driver and therefore the pre-indication is
independent of the estimated speed.

3.13.9.5.12Note 2: For trackside engineering reasons, the assumptions for the calculation of the
EBI supervision limit are necessary to obtain a fully predictable pre-indication location,
i.e. independent from the measured acceleration and speed confidence interval.

3.13.10.1.3 Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run
with the speed as defined by the MRSP without the need to brake to a target.

3.13.10.1.4Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the

Specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the
train brakes to a target.

3.13.10.1.5 Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to
the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA.

3.13.10.2 General requirements

3.13.10.2.1 The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the
speed monitoring. This shall be the estimated speed.

3.13.10.2.2 Once a Train Interface command (traction cut-off, service brake or emergency brake)

is triggered, the on-board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is
met.

3.13.10.2.3 If there is no on-board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring),

whenever a service brake command is specified, the emergency brake command shall
be triggered instead.

3.13.10.2.4The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to
the requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the
emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In
such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI
supervision limit shall prevail.

3.13.10.2.5 The on-board shall revoke the Intervention status only when no brake command is
applied by the speed and distance monitoring function.

3.13.10.2.6In level 2/3: Train trip shall be initiated if the on-board equipment detects that the
minimum safe front end has passed the EOA/LOA location.

3.13.10.2.7In Level 1: Train Trip shall be initiated if the on-board equipment detects that the
minimum safe antenna position (calculated by subtracting distance between active
Eurobalise antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end position)
has passed the EOA/LOA location.

3.13.10.2.8In the following sections, the term V_MRSP (together with the derived ceiling
supervision limits) refers to the lowest MRSP element encountered between the min
safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.

3.13.10.3 Requirements for Ceiling speed monitoring
3.13.10.3.1 The on-board equipment shall display the Permitted speed.

3.13.10.3.2When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on-board
equipment shall display the SBI speed.

3.13.10.3.3The on-board shall compare the estimated speed with the ceiling supervision limits
defined in section 3.13.9.2 and shall trigger/revoke commands to the train interface
(service brake if implemented or emergency brake) and supervision statuses as
described in Table 5 and Table 6.

Table 7: Transitions between supervision statuses in ceiling speed monitoring

3.13.10.3.5When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the ceiling
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t1 defined in Table 5
shall be checked in order to determine whether the Normal status applies. If it is not
the case, the on-board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant
value, applying a transition from the Normal status according to Table 7.

3.13.10.3.6 The Indication status is not used in ceiling speed monitoring. However, in case the
ceiling speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to
Indication, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions
from the Indication status, as described in Table 7.

3.13.10.4 Requirements for Target speed monitoring

3.13.10.4.1 In target speed monitoring, both the ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2 and 3.13.9.3, are used to determine
the commands to the Train Interface and the information displayed to the driver.

3.13.10.4.2 The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Restrictive Displayed
Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be defined as the target of which the braking to target
Permitted speed supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5), calculated for the
current position of the train, is the lowest one amongst the supervised targets:

3.13.10.4.7 If the MRDT is neither the EOA nor the SvL, the indicated distance to the target shall
be the distance between the maximum safe front end and the location of the Permitted
speed supervision limit calculated for the target speed (see section 3.13.9.3.5 for the
calculation of this location), but limited to zero after this location is passed.

3.13.10.4.9 The on-board shall consider the service brake command as available for use unless:
a) The service brake command is not implemented, OR

b) The national value inhibits its use.

3.13.10.4.10    The on-board equipment shall compare the estimated speed and train position
with the ceiling and braking to target supervision limits and shall trigger/revoke
commands to the train interface (traction cut-off if implemented, service brake if
available for use or emergency brake) and supervision statuses, by evaluating and
taking into account the conditions as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.10.1.

3.13.10.4.10.1 The conditions in Table 8 and Table 10 shall be evaluated for each target related
to an MRSP speed decrease or LOA, the conditions in Table 9 and Table 11 shall be
evaluated for the targets EOA and SvL and for the end of the maximum permitted
distance to run in Staff Responsible. The triggering conditions shall be taken into
account, if the supervision limits for any target satisfy the specified conditions. The
revocation conditions shall only be taken into account, if the supervision limits for all
targets satisfy the specified conditions.

monitoring, EOA/SvL with release speed (number in circle corresponds with equivalent
triggering condition in Table 9)

3.13.10.4.11      The braking to target Indication supervision limit is not used for estimated speeds
higher than V_MRSP. However the location of the Indication supervision limit, valid for
V_MRSP, shall be used for estimated speeds higher than V_MRSP in order to
discriminate whether information related to the Indication status has to be displayed to
the driver. In other terms, for estimated speeds above V_MRSP, this location of the
Indication supervision limit defines a pre-indication display area starting from the pre-
indication location and ending at this location.

3.13.10.4.12    Note: Figure 56 shows the parts of the ceiling speed and braking to target
supervision limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to trigger the brake
commands and the transitions between supervision statuses. It does not show what is
displayed to the driver: in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is
displayed (even if not supervised) for values lower than the release speed.

3.13.10.4.13    In case of target EOA/SvL without any supervised release speed, the Table 9
and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting V_release with the value 0.

3.13.10.4.13.1 In case the target is the location at the end of the maximum permitted distance to

V_release with the value 0, SvL with staff responsible end location and by ignoring any
formula related to EOA.

3.13.10.4.14     Note: as long as the same MRSP or LOA target is displayed, the on-board will
revoke the Indication status only when the estimated speed does no longer exceed the
target speed. On the other hand, as long as the same EOA/SvL target is displayed, the
Indication status, once it is triggered, is never revoked. However, for all types of target
and only in case of MRDT change, the on-board will revoke the Indication status if the

remains commanded when the on-board switches to target speed monitoring and is
only revoked when the Permitted speed supervision limit is no longer exceeded.

3.13.10.6.3If a transition from target speed monitoring to ceiling speed or release speed
monitoring occurs while a traction cut-off command is already applied, the traction cut-
off command shall be immediately revoked.

3.14.1.7.1 If the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed reversing distance related
to a reversing area or due to any further movement in the direction opposite to the train
orientation while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the brake command shall
be released if the reversing distance becomes extended so that the reversing distance
is no longer overpassed, or at standstill after driver acknowledgement.

3.14.1.7.2 If the brake command was triggered due to change of Train Data while running (see
section 5.17 procedure "Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver’),
the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement.

3.15.1       RBC/RBC Handover

3.15.1.1 Introduction

3.15.1.1.1 Trains with one or more radio(s) shall be able to pass from one RBC area to another
automatically (without driver action).

3.15.1.1.2 Since an RBC is unable to know whether the on-board is able to manage one or two
communication session(s) at once, the following principles are applicable for both
cases. Thereby, the RBCs will have the same behaviour in both cases.

3.15.1.1.3 An RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with one communication session available
may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to “prepare” (session
establishment, version determination, ...) the expected supervision by the Accepting
RBC until the on-board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC.

3.15.1.1.4 In level 3, trains following the one with one communication session available will
always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from
the disconnection from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting
RBC.

3.15.1.2 Handing Over RBC
3.15.1.2.1 When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another
RBC area, it shall send:
a) Intentionally deleted.
b) To the Accepting RBC the following information:
e The ETCS identity of the on-board equipment;

e The border location that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting
RBC area;

e Current mode of the on-board equipment;

e Optionally, Train Data;

e Optionally, for a non-leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine.
3.15.1.2.2 The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on-board equipment

concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding
information from the Accepting RBC.

3.15.1.2.3 It shall be possible for the Handing Over RBC to request route related information from
the Accepting RBC, limited to a maximum amount of data.

3.15.1.2.3.1      Note: Route related information is :
a) Movement authorities

the implementation trackside.

3.15.1.2.4 Note: Route related information received from the Accepting RBC will be processed by
the Handing Over RBC if possible.

3.15.1.2.6 When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the maximum
safe front end of the train has passed the border location, it shall inform the Accepting
RBC.

3.15.1.2.6.1      Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting
RBC that the train has entered the Accepting RBC area.

3.15.1.2.7 When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the minimum
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, it shall send a disconnection order to
the on-board equipment.

3.15.1.2.8 When the Accepting RBC informs the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the
responsibility, the latter shall stop sending route related information to the on-board
equipment.

3.15.1.2.9 When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to
be cancelled, it shall send this cancellation information to the Accepting RBC (including
the train identification).

3.15.1.2.9.1      Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:
e Change to a route which does no more include the border;

e The sending of an “end of mission” information from the on-board equipment.
3.15.1.3 On-board equipment

3.15.1.3.1 When receiving an order to switch to another RBC at a given location, the on-board
equipment shall:

a) Establish the communication session with the Accepting RBC;

b) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the maximum safe front end
of the train passes the given location;

c) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the minimum safe rear end
of the train passes the given location;

3.15.1.3.2 It is up to the on-board equipment to manage the establishment of one communication
session and the release of the other one:

a) If it is able to handle two communication sessions at the same time, the radio
session with the Accepting RBC shall be established as soon as it receives the RBC
transition order.

b) If it is able to handle one communication session only at a given time, it shall wait
until the session with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the
border (refer to 3.5.5.1e and 3.15.1.2.7) and then establish the session with the
Accepting RBC.

3.15.1.3.3 As soon as the on-board equipment has established the session with the Accepting
RBC, it shall send its Train Data unless it is in sleeping or non leading mode.

3.15.1.3.4 When the on-board equipment is connected to both RBCs, it shall send its position
reports to both of them with the use of the position report parameters valid for the
Handing Over RBC.

3.15.1.3.4.1      If the on-board equipment is connected to both RBCs, and it executes an End of
Mission, it shall execute the End of Mission procedure with both RBCs

3.15.1.3.5 When the on-board sends a position report directly to the Accepting RBC with its
maximum safe front end having passed the border, it shall use information received
from the Accepting RBC and only a disconnection order shall be accepted from the
Handing Over RBC.

Accepting RBC

The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC
updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions.

As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on-board equipment a position report
and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility.

When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on-board equipment and
the Handing over RBC Train Data provided by the on-board equipment shall take
precedence.

If the Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Handing Over RBC,
it shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding on-
board equipment (if already established).

The Accepting RBC shall comply with the maximum amount of data contained in the
last received route related information request from the Handing Over RBC.

RBC/RBC message acknowledgement

As soon as a _ consistent RBC/RBC message including the request for
acknowledgement is received, the receiving RBC shall send an acknowledgement to
the emitting RBC.

The RBC/RBC message is consistent when all checks have been completed
successfully:

a) It has passed the checks performed by the RBC/RBC Safe Communication
Interface protocol (see SUBSET-098);

b) Variables in the message do not have invalid values.

Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines

It shall be possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being
under the control of a driver.

Only the leading engine shall be responsible for the train movement supervision
functions.

Splitting/joining

ERTMS/ETCS shall allow Splitting and Joining using the normal supervision functions
available (e.g. On-sight, Shunting).

Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment each.

Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures.

ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect).

Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining
shall require the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation
has been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection).

Reversing of movement direction

It shall be possible to send in advance to an on-board equipment information about
areas, where initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible, i.e. change the
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.

A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available
on-board.

Together with start and end of reversing area, the following supervision information
shall be sent:

a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing
area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area where reversing
of movement is permitted at the time of reception of this reversing area information.

b) Reversing mode speed limit allowed during reverse movement.

While at standstill with the front end of the train inside the indicated area, it shall be
possible forthe driver to reverse the direction of movement.

The on-board equipment shall allow movement in the direction opposite to the train
orientation, supervising it according to distance and speed received.

Note: level transitions and RBC/RBC handovers are not handled by the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment when in Reversing mode.

When at standstill the on-board equipment shall inform the driver if the reversing of
movement is permitted.

If the end location of the maximum distance to run in the opposite direction is passed
by the train front end, the emergency brake command shall be triggered.

Track ahead free

In a level 2/3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to handle a
track ahead free request given by the RBC.

The track ahead free request from the RBC shall indicate to the on-board

a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall begin to display the
request to the driver.

b) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop to display the
request to the driver (in case the driver did not acknowledge).

The driver shall have the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead free request
(meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train and the next
signal or board marking signal position is free).

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop
displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free.

There shall be no restrictive consequence by the on-board system if the driver does
not acknowledge.

A new track ahead free request shall replace the one previously received and stored.

Handling of National Systems

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall support driving on national infrastructure under the
supervision of National Systems.

In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is interfaced to a National System
through an STM, refer to Subset 035 for detailed requirements.

Amongst the data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS that can be
transmitted by trackside over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels, it shall be
possible to send from balises or RBC data to be forwarded to a National System.

Note: Definition of what qualifies as “data to be forwarded to a National System” is
national dependent and outside the scope of Subset 026.

Tolerance of Big Metal Mass

Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as defined in
Subset-036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm reporting
a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function.

In Levels 0/NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored
for a defined distance (see A3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction.

Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all
excessive big metal masses with track condition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted
areas.

Cold Movement Detection

After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours.

When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, if
available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the
status of information stored by on-board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for
details).

Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as
not available if:

a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment, OR

b) the Cold Movement Detection function has encountered a condition, during the No
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement information (e.g. the
battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No
Power period).

Virtual Balise Cover

It shall be possible to set and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC). A VBC
is defined by:

a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on-board together with the
area (country or region) in which the VBC is applicable. The VBC marker and the
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity.

b) Its validity period.

During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to
remove an existing one.

As long as a VBC is stored on-board:

a) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ignore any balise telegram that
includes a VBC marker and a country/region identity that both match the VBC
identity.

b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise
telegram occur.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives from balise or from driver a new
VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace
the previous one, including its validity period.

A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on-board equipment is switched off (i.e.
enters No Power mode) and shall remain applicable when powered on again. It shall
be deleted when:

a) it is ordered by trackside, or
b) its validity period has elapsed, or
cj it is removed by the driver (during Start of Mission), or

d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from a balise group
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Note: this means that the reception of a
consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting a VBC due to
mismatching country/region identities.

Advance display of route related information

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the possibility to display, only on
driver request, an overview of the gradient profile (as received from trackside), of the
MRSP, of the track conditions (except the tunnel stopping areas), of the indication
location at MRSP speed (see 3.13.10.4.11) and of the first target at zero speed, if any
(e.g. the EOA or the start location of a mode profile), with the remaining distances
referred to the train front end position.

into account the min safe, the estimated or the max safe train front end position
depending on their respective supervision.

With regards to the gradient profile, the remaining distances shall be computed taking
into account the estimated train front end position.

The overview of route related information shall be restricted to the elements contained
within the movement authority and up to the first target at zero speed, if any.

Data Consistency

Criteria of consistency
The on-board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the
following criteria is not fulfilled.

a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and
respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid values

b) The message shall be received in due time.

c) The message shall be received at the right expected location.
as stated below.

Note: a value of a variable is invalid when a spare value is used.

Balises

Definitions
The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram.

The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a balise
group is called a balise group message.

Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message
coincide.

A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if

a) No balise is found within the maximum distance between balises from the previous
balise in the group.

or

b) A following balise within the group has been passed.

3.16.2.3 Linking Consistency

3.16.2.3.1 If linking information is used the on-board shall react according to the linking reaction
information in the following cases:

a) If the location reference of the expected balise group is found in rear of the
expectation window

b) If the location reference of the expected balise group is not found inside the
expectation window (i.e. the end of the expectation window has been reached
without having found the expected balise group)

c) If inside the expectation window of the expected balise group another announced
balise group, expected later, is found.

3.16.2.3.1.1     The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall reject the message from a balise
group found with its location reference outside its expectation window.

3.16.2.3.2 The on-board shall reject the message from the expected group and trip the train if the
balise group is passed in the unexpected direction.

3.16.2.3.2.1      Exception: When the expected balise group is referred in the linking information
with a balise group with ID “unknown”, 3.4.4.4.2.1 shall apply.

3.16.2.3.3 If the location reference balise of the group is duplicated and the on-board is only able
to correctly evaluate the duplicating one, the duplicating one shall be used as location
reference instead.

3.16.2.3.4 If the balise duplicating the location reference balise is used as location reference for
the group, and is found within the expectation window, no linking reaction shall be
applied.

3.16.2.4 Balise Group Message Consistency

3.16.2.4.1 If linking information is used, the on-board shall reject the message from a linked
balise group found in the expected location and react according to the linking reaction
in the following cases:

a) A balise is missed inside the group.
b) A balise is detected but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC....).

3.16.2.4.2 Exception: Concerning a) and b) above, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
not reject the message and shall not apply the linking reaction if the balise not found,
or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group and the duplicating one is
correctly read.

3.16.2.4.3 If linking information is used, the on-board shall reject the message from a balise
group marked as linked but not included in the linking information. No reaction shall be
applied, even if errors in the reading of the balise group occur.

3.16.2.4.4 If no linking information is used, the on-board shall reject the message from a balise
group marked as linked and command application of the service brake in the following
cases:
a) A balise is missed inside the group.
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC).
c) Variables in the balise group message have invalid values.

d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)

3.16.2.4.7 Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message,
excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2.4.6, if their values are not all identical, or at
least one of them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall be considered as a message
consistency error.

3.16.2.4.7.1      In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram
complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall also be considered as a message consistency
error.

3.16.2.4.8 It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU
(e.g. the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message
or a RIU message including the information "default balise/loop/RIU information".

3.16.2.4.8.1      If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the

a) the on-board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise
group that was announced and already found

b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is found.

3.16.2.7.2.2       If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously
expected and already found repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall command the service brake and the driver shall be informed. At
standstill, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the
current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which
shall be shortened.

3.16.2.7.2.3     Note: this function is independent from linking function, i.e. the rules related to
linking always apply. This means that once a repositioning balise group has been
found and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment will start expecting the first balise group announced in this new linking
information in parallel with the monitoring specified in 3.16.2.7.2.1.

3.16.3      Radio

3.16.3.1 General issues

3.16.3.1.1 A radio message is consistent when all checks have been completed successfully:
a) Checks performed by Euroradio protocol have been passed (see Subset-037)
b) Time stamps checks have been passed (see 3.16.3.3.3)

c) Variables in the messages do not have in-valid values.

3.16.3.1.1.1    The on-board shall reject a message transmitted from the trackside if the
message is not consistent.

3.16.3.1.1.2      The on-board shall inform the trackside if a not consistent message is received.

3.16.3.1.2 Emergency messages shall be transmitted either as high priority data or as normal

3.16.3.2.2 To time-stamp its messages, the trackside shall make a safe estimation of the on-
board time, based on the time-stamp of the received messages and the internal
processing times.
The estimation shall be made in such a way that the on-board time estimated by the
trackside shall not be in advance of the real on-board time.

3.16.3.2.3 Wrap around of the onboard timer can occur during a communication session and
shall have no impact on system behaviour.

3.16.3.3 Supervision of Sequence

3.16.3.3.1 The trackside shall time-stamp a message with a value corresponding to the time of

sending.
3.16.3.3.2 There shall always be a time stamp increment between consecutive messages.

3.16.3.3.3 If the time stamp of the last received message is lower than or equal to the former one

its content shall not be used.
3.16.3.3.3.1       Only time stamps of messages received as normal priority data shall be used.

3.16.3.3.3.2      Note: The supervision does not detect a lost message. This has to be assured by
means of the “acknowledge” function.

3.16.3.3.4 If, at the initiation of the communication session, the time stamp is set to unknown the
message shall be accepted.

3.17      System Version Management

3.17.1     Introduction

3.17.1.1 Definitions, high level principles and rules regarding the offline management of
ERTMS/ETCS system version during the ERTMS/ETCS system life time are given in
SUBSET-104.

3.17.1.2 | The objective of this section is to define requirements applicable to ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment and to trackside constituents, when different versions of the
ERTMS/ETCS system have been defined.

3.17.1.3 Intentionally deleted.

3.17.2      Determination of the operated system version

3.17.2.1 The on-board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of the
ERTMS/ETCS system version numbers X included in the envelope of legally operated
system versions, as defined in chapter 6.

3.17.2.2 The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it
shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version
(refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one
introduced in this release of the SRS).

3.17.2.3 The on-board equipment shall determine the operated system version, in relation to
non-RBC trackside constituents, as the system version number X transmitted by any
balise, loop or RIU, if this system version number X is higher than the currently
operated one.

3.17.2.4 It shall be possible from balise group to order the on-board equipment to operate a
system version.

3.17.2.5 On receiving the order to operate system version from balise group, the on-board
equipment shall immediately operate the system version given in the order. After the
order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any further
received balise telegram/loop message or any further contacted RIU.

3.17.2.5.1 Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one.

3.17.2.6 If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a
balise/loop and the corresponding identifier(s) for which a set of national values is used
onboard, the on-board equipment shall consider the system version number X

SUBSET-026-3                                            System Requirements Specification                        Page 170/200

transmitted by this balise/loop as the operated one and shall comply again with
requirement 3.17.2.3.

3.17.2.7 If the on-board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted
by a non-RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it
shall consider the operated system version as unchanged.

3.17.2.8 | In case of communication session established with an RBC, the system version of the
RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation to non-RBC
constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the operated system
version shall be determined according to the following principles:

a) if the on-board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2/3 area),
the RBC system version shall be operated when the transition to level 2/3 is
executed;

b) if the on-board equipment is in level 2/3 (SoM procedure or order received from
trackside), the RBC system version shall be operated immediately;

c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the
accepting RBC system version shall be operated as soon as the engine has passed
the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end;

d) in case the on-board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.g. exit
from a level 2/3 area), the system version control in relation to non-RBC
constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again
considered;

e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe
front end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version
control in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise
group orders shall be again considered.

3.17.2.9 | The system version currently operated when the on-board equipment is switched off
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and re-used when powered on.

3.17.2.9.1 If the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), the highest
supported system version shall be used.

3.17.3      Handling of trackside data in relation to system version

3.17.3.1 Every telegram transmitted by a balise, and every message transmitted by Euroloop
and Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not
allowed for the balise, Euroloop and Radio Infill Unit to transmit data correspondent to
several system versions.

3.17.3.2 All messages transmitted by an RBC shall contain data only related to one system
version.

National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are
applicable. They shall become applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable
immediately.

Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the
country or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.

For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back
value if:

e the National Value is not available, or

e amismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set with which the
National Value was received and stored.

Note: even though the National Values are always transmitted as a single set for a
given system version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that
when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a
balise group, the on-board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of
National Values

The National Values currently applicable when the on-board equipment is switched off
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain applicable when
powered on.

Justification: The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been
received on-board, there is no need to re-load the information unless National Values
change, the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train
enters an area requiring different National Values.

The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on
transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values.

When a new set of National Values becomes applicable its content shall always
overwrite the corresponding National Values currently applicable regardless of the
country or region identifier(s).

A previously received set of National Values which is not yet applicable shall be
deleted if:

e anew set of National Values is received, or

e the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power
mode).

If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected between the
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s)
of the applicable set with which the National Value was received and stored, then it
shall be deleted.

Note: If a valid RBC identity and telephone number is available on-board, no driver
data entry is needed to establish a connection to the RBC.

If the driver enters level 2/3, at start of mission, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall offer the driver different means to select the RBC contact information (including
RBC identity, RBC telephone number, and the identity of the radio network to be
used), for details see chapter 5, Start of Mission procedure.

In normal operation after the start of mission, the driver shall have no further possibility
to modify the RBC contact information (all further modifications of this data are
executed automatically). Exception: after a manual level change to level 2/3 and if
either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or no valid RBC-ID/phone
number is available, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall request the driver to
select the RBC contact information by the same means as for Start of Mission.

3.18.4.3.4 If the driver selects “Use of EIRENE short number” to contact the RBC and the
communication session is successfully established, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall store as valid RBC identity and telephone number, the RBC identity
reported by EURORADIO and the EIRENE short number, respectively.

3.18.4.3.4.1     Note: If the short number is re-used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
(e.g. following a loss of safe radio connection) and does not direct to a RBC with the
stored RBC ID, the connection will be terminated (EURORADIO functionality).

3.18.4.3.5 The unit, range and resolution of the RBC identity and telephone number shall be as
specified in A.3.11.

3.18.4.4 ETCS Identity

3.18.4.4.1 The ETCS identity of an on-board equipment is made of a single identity number. The
ETCS identity of an RBC, balise group, loop or RIU is composed of a country/region
identity number and of an identity number within the country/region.

3.18.4.4.2 All on-board equipments in service, balise groups marked as linked, RBC’s, RIU’s, and
loops shall be assigned a unique ETCS identity within their respective group.

3.18.4.4.3 The assignment of (unique or not) ETCS identities to balise groups marked as
unlinked is the sole responsibility of the entity in charge of the assignment of values
(see SUBSET-054), depending on the specific trackside implementation.

3.18.4.5 Train Running Number

3.18.4.5.1 During the Start of Mission, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a leading engine
shall acquire the train running number from driver input, from the RBC or from other
ERTMS/ETCS external sources.

3.18.4.5.2 It shall be possible to enter train running number also in a non-leading engine.

3.18.4.5.3 It shall be possible to change the train running number while running, from driver input,
from the RBC or from other ERTMS/ETCS external sources.

3.18.4.5.4 Following any entry/modification of the train running number when a communication
session is already established or following the successful establishment of a
communication session when valid train running number is already available, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall send the train running number to the RBC.

3.18.4.5.4.1     Exception: if the train running number has been received from the RBC, it shall
not be sent back to the RBC by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

3.18.4.5.5 The unit, range and resolution of the train running number shall be as specified in
A.3.11.

3.18.4.6.1 The adhesion factor shall be used to adjust the emergency brake model of the train
(see 3.13).

3.18.4.6.2 The adhesion factor may be changed while the train is running.

3.18.4.6.2.1       It shall be possible to update the adhesion factor from trackside and - if permitted
by a National value - by the driver. If, following a change of National Values, the
update of the adhesion factor is no more permitted to the driver, the adhesion factor
previously modified by the driver to slippery rail shall immediately be reset to non
slippery rail. Any trackside adhesion profile is not affected.

3.18.4.6.2.2       The adhesion factor shall be sent as profile data from trackside when needed.

3.18.4.6.2.3      The driver shall be informed whether the value of the adhesion factor is “slippery
rail”.

3.18.4.6.3 The selection of the adhesion value from trackside or by driver entry shall be limited to
the options slippery rail/ non slippery rail.

individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the
train orientation), the ignoring of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole

All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special
situations.

The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are:

a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2);

b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4);

c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2);

d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time-out
(3.8.4.4.2) ;

e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2);
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);

g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill
(3.16.2.5.2);

h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;

i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;

j) the train category, axle load category, loading gauge or traction system is changed
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ;

k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;

|) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at
standstill (3.16.2.7)

m)inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and no linking is used onboard
and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.4.4.2)

n) the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the on-board considers an
SvL (3.8.4.3.2)

A.3.4.1.3 Depending on the situation, the action can be:
a) data is deleted,
b) data is reset (set to initial states)
c) data status is unchanged,

d) data is to be revalidated

D = Deleted U=Unchanged R= Reset         TBR = To Be Revalidated

A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations

A.3.5.1     Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside,
the on-board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither
reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse
movement (initiated by driver or due to roll-away) and the sub-sequent forward
movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG. This rule shall
apply to the following actions:

e Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)
e Request to acknowledge new level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)
e Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)

e Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode transition due to mode profile (see
3.12.4)

e Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3)
e Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)

e Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big
metal masses and non stopping areas

e Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4)
e Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)”
e Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)

A.3.5.2    Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has received a balise group message
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s)
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related
to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed.

A.3.5.2.1 Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna,
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the
EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the
replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on-board as happening before the
min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause
3.13.10.2.7 applies).

A.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA) has been processed, will not lead
to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. In
other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA and the end of override procedure

(see 5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on-board as simultaneously
happening before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location.

Deletion of accepted and stored information when used

Standard case

When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied
by trackside information no longer used, i.e., the related on-board functionality has
been completed, shall be made available immediately.

Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity
available on-board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information
stored on-board given in Subset 040.

Exception

Following information shall remain stored on-board for a distance defined by a fixed
value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:

e location dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR
(see 3.11.2.2)

e gradient information,
e reduced adhesion information received from trackside,
e Track condition “Big metal masses’.

Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:

e With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”, the stored
information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to calculate speed
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver)

e Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track.

Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is
determined by a National/Default value. This is also true for a reverse movement in
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately.
In order to keep the on-board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chosen
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is
no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is made available again.

Calculation of the basic deceleration

The brake percentage (A) shall be converted into two different input parameters:
Ao = A for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))

A.3.10 Service brake feedback

A.3.10.1_ The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves.

A.3.10.2 The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if:
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND

b) The national value does not inhibit its use.

A.3.10.3 Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe
pressure and brake cylinder pressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted
into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way:

The reference pressure pO shall thereafter be adapted to the current pressure

second):

Where:

-      p is limited to max 550 kPa.
-      Values given in kPa.

A.3.10.5 Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to Os and 2 s, the locking will remain until
the target speed monitoring is left, even if the train speed comes below the target
speed. This avoids “jumping” indications. It also makes it possible to release the
brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves moving back again. It
might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver releases the brakes
too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To keep 2 s between
the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid
emergency brake.

A.3.10.6 Note: If feedback has started but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback
function will remain active until the target point is reached. This avoids “jumping”
indications in some rare situations.

Definition of the modes

Introduction

For each mode the following information is given:

a) The context of utilisation of the mode and the functions that characterise the mode
(chapter “Description”.

b) The ERTMS/ETCS levels in which the mode can be used (chapter “Used in
levels”).

c) The related responsibility of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and of the
driver, once the equipment is in this mode (chapter “Responsibilities”).

A complete list of transitions to and from each mode is given in the section 4.6.2
“Transitions Table” ).

General Requirements

When the desk is open, a clear indication of the ERTMS/ETCS mode shall be shown
to the driver.

Intentionally deleted.

4.4.3     ISOLATION

4.4.3.1         Description

4.4.3.1.1 In Isolation mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be physically isolated
from the brakes and can be isolated from other on-board equipments/systems
depending on the specific on-board implementation.

4.4.3.1.2 There shall be a clear indication to the driver that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment is isolated.

4.4.3.1.3 To leave Isolation mode, a special operating procedure is needed (no transition from
Isolation is specified). This procedure shall ensure that the on-board equipment is only
put back into service when it has been proven that this is safe for operation.

4.4.3.1.4 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

4.4.3.2         Used in levels

4.4.3.2.1 Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC.

4.4.3.3         Responsibilities

4.4.3.3.1 Isolation of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is performed by the driver under his
complete responsibility.

4.4.3.3.2 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is isolated, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment has no more responsibility.

NO POWER

Description

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not powered, the equipment shall be
in the No Power mode.

Note: in order to ensure cold movement detection function, some parts of the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment may be fed by an auxiliary power supply.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall permanently command the emergency
brake.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

Used in levels

Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC.

Responsibilities

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has no responsibility in this mode, except
commanding the emergency brake and (optionally) monitoring cold movements.

The notion of responsibility of the driver is not relevant for the No Power mode.

If it is required to move a loco in NP mode as a wagon, ETCS brake command must
be overridden by external means.

SLEEPING

Description

The Sleeping mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a
slave engine that is remote controlled.

The desk(s) of a sleeping engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no
information shall be shown).

As the engine is remote controlled by the leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision.

particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to
train front/rear end.

Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on-board via the train interface.

If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall therefore try to memorise the
occurrence of such fault(s), which shall be handled when the engine leaves the
Sleeping mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also try to send an error
information to the RBC.

If a desk of the sleeping engine is opened while the train is running (this is an
abnormal operation), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand-By
mode.

If the “sleeping input signal” is lost (no more detection of the remote control), the
switch to Stand-By mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall open a communication session with the
RBC when at least one of the following events occurs:

a) in all levels, on receipt of the order to contact the RBC.

b) In level 2/3, when entering or exiting Sleeping mode (to report the change of mode
to the RBC).

c) In level 2/3, when a safety critical fault of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
occurs (to report the fault to the RBC).

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes

SHUNTING

Description

The purpose of the Shunting mode is to enable shunting movements. In Shunting
mode, The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment supervises the train movements
against:

a) aceiling speed: the shunting mode speed limit

b) a list of expected balise groups (if such list was sent by the trackside equipment).
The train shall be tripped if a balise group, not contained in the list, is passed
(When an empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent,
all balise groups can be passed)

c) “stop if in shunting mode” information. The train is tripped if such information is
received from balise groups

d) Intentionally deleted

The Shunting mode shall not require Train Data.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function
Intentionally deleted.

When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage level
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level
transition order shall be stored and evaluated only when another mode than Shunting
or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the Shunting movement is
terminated).

When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board in Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store
the RBC ID/phone number.

When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-RBC
hand-over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number given at the RBC/RBC border.

Shunting mode can be selected by the driver, only accepted when the train is at
standstill, or ordered by the trackside.

In case of selection of Shunting mode by the driver:

e in level 1 operations, the switch to shunting is always accepted by the on-board
equipment

e in level 2 and 3 areas, the on-board shall ask the trackside for an authorisation. The
switch to shunting is possible only after receiving such authorisation. The trackside
can send a list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass while in SH, together with
the authorisation

STAFF RESPONSIBLE

Description

The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area.

This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example:

a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment starts-up (awakening of the train).

b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA.

c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:

a)

b)

9)

a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit

a given distance (regarding its origin location see 4.4.11.1.3.1). The ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves with a target speed of zero to
the end of this distance. If the train overpasses this distance (see next note) the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trip the train

a list of expected balise groups, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train
shall be tripped if over-passing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an
empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise
groups can be passed)

balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the
train, unless the over-passed balise group is included in a list of expected balises
as defined in item c)

running in the direction opposite to the train orientation (reverse movement
protection)

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall determine the start location of the SR distance

as follows:

a)

9)

If the National/Default value determines the max permitted distance to run in SR
mode, the starting point of this distance shall refer to the estimated position of the
train front when SR mode was entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode,
when Override was activated.

If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value
transmitted by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the start location of the distance
shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when the distance information
is received or entered.

If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value
transmitted by EUROLOOP, the distance information transmitted by EUROLOOP
shall be referred to one or more reference balise groups. On-board shall evaluate

the distance to run in SR mode by matching the reference balise groups given with
the LRBG.

In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the
distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information,
the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance
given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and
the LRBG.

4.4.11.1.4 Note: Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff
Responsible mode does not ensure that the train will not pass the given distance.

4.4.11.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify
the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible
only at standstill.

4.4.11.1.5.1        If a train movement is detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance
limits, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger the brake command.

4.4.11.1.5.2      The unit, range and resolution of the SR mode speed limit and distance entered
by the driver shall be as specified in A.3.11.

4.4.11.1.6 In level 2/3, the driver shall have the possibility to request a new distance to run in
Staff Responsible, by selecting "Start". This triggers an MA request.

4.4.11.1.6.1       Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further.

4.4.11.1.6.2     When entering SR mode, the value applicable for SR mode speed limit and the
value applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default values.
Exception for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance.

4.4.11.1.6.3     While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if
available, the last value entered by the driver.

4.4.11.1.6.4      While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available,
the last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment amongst:

a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver;

b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside.

4.4.11.1.6.5      When "Override" is selected, the SR mode speed limit value and the SR distance
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The
corresponding National/Default values shall enter in force.

4.4.11.1.6.6     If the train is in SR and receives a new distance to run in SR mode from the
RBC, the stored list of expected balise groups, if any, shall be deleted or shall be
replaced by the list of expected balise groups sent together with the distance to run in

4.4.15      NON LEADING

4.4.15.1 Description

4.4.15.1.1 The Non-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
of a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not
remote controlled) but has its own driver.

4.4.15.1.1.1       Note: This operating situation is called Tandem.

4.4.15.1.1.2     The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to
enter in Non-Leading mode, a “non leading input signal" from the train interface.

4.4.15.1.1.3    If the “non leading input signal" is no longer present, the switch to Stand-By
mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill.

4.4.15.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not perform any train movement
supervision in Non-Leading mode.

4.4.15.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to
train front/rear end.

4.4.15.1.4 When level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position to
the RBC, according to the previously received parameters.

4.4.15.1.5 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a non-leading
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall therefore try to memorise the
occurrence of such fault(s), which shall be handled when the engine leaves Non
Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also try to send an error
information to the RBC.

4.4.15.1.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed to the driver.

REVERSING

Description

The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This shall
be possible only in areas so marked by trackside. Reversing areas shall be announced
in advance by trackside.

Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:
a) aceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside

b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation, given from
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance

After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing
distance, and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the
direction opposite to the train orientation.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted
speed and the remaining distance to run.

In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3 table 5, triggering
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency
brake instead of the service brake. For the revocation of the brake command, refer to
3.13.10.2.4.

The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the
driving cab (as before reversing).

Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement
Protection (as in RV mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV
mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a
directional data, oriented backwards.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

4.4.18.1.10In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1),

the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

4.4.18.1.11In case there is an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission

function, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall ignore this alarm.

4.4.19      LIMITED SUPERVISION

4.4.19.1 Description

4.4.19.1.1 The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas where
trackside information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train.

4.4.19.1.2 Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered
automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled.

4.4.19.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against a
dynamic speed profile.

4.4.19.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed and the release
speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive — refer to chapter 4.7 “DMI depending on
modes”). Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the
generic LS function marker is stored on-board or if the conditions in clause
4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also display the
lowest speed amongst:

a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the
EOA/LOA, AND
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA

4.4.19.1.4.1     The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised
Speed within the Movement Authority (LSSMA)

4.4.19.1.4.2    Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board

equipment shall start a delay timer:

a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the message
including the order.

b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first
encountered balise of the balise group giving the order.

c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer
(see section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed.

4.4.19.1.4.3     When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the LSSMA.

4.4.19.1.4.4     On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the LSSMA display, a toggle on
order which has not been executed yet (because the on-board delay timer has not
reached the delay time-out value) shall be deleted by the on-board equipment.

4.4.19.1.4.5   If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall toggle off the LSSMA display in case:

b) an order to toggle off the LSSMA display is received.
4.4.19.1.4.6   When entering the Limited Supervision mode, the LSSMA display shall be
toggled off by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, unless a toggle on order is

received and leads immediately to the display of the LSSMA as per clauses
4.4.19.1.4.2 and 4.4.19.1.4.3.

4.4.19.1.4.7      If the generic LS function marker is not stored on-board, the clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2
to 4.4.19.1.4.6 shall not apply and the LSSMA shall be displayed if:

a) the target speed at the EOA/LOA is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed
limit, AND

b) the LSSMA is lower than the maximum train speed.

4.4.19.1.4.8      The generic LS function marker shall be deleted by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment as soon as a Limited Supervision mode profile is received without it in the
same balise group message.

4.4.19.1.5 If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment requests the driver to enter the "track ahead free" information.

4.4.19.1.6 To be in Limited Supervision mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole
length of the train, but shall be at least available from the FRONT END of the train.

4.4.20      PASSIVE SHUNTING

4.4.20.1 Description

4.4.20.1.1 The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the
leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry
on a shunting movement with a single engine fitted with one on-board equipment and
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab.

4.4.20.1.2 The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no
information shall be shown).

4.4.20.1.3 As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall not perform any train movement supervision.

4.4.20.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform Train Position function; in
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to
train front/rear end.

4.4.20.1.5 It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode;
while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function
“Continue Shunting on desk closure”.

4.4.20.1.6 When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to
Passive Shunting mode if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active
and the “passive shunting input signal” is received from the train interface. If the
function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the “passive shunting
input signal” is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to
Stand-By mode instead.

4.4.20.1.7 The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” shall allow one and only one
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be
inactive once the Shunting mode is left.

4.4.20.1.8 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and no “Stop Shunting on desk
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode.

4.4.20.1.9 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Stop Shunting on desk
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode.

4.4.20.1.10If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall therefore try to
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which shall be handled when the engine
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only when another mode than
Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the Shunting movement is
terminated).

4.4.20.1.12When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-

4.6          Transitions between modes

4.6.1          Symbols

4.6.1.1      The indication “4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition
4.6.1.2     From the mode located in the column
4.6.1.3     To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “>”.

4.6.1.4     Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “-px-”, x is the
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at
the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2.

4.6.1.5     Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and
the transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order).

4.6.1.6      "16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

4.7       DMI depending on modes

4.7.1      Introduction

4.7.1.1    The DMI is an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the
driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information
done via the train interface (e.g. a driver's action on the service brake used for the
service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI.

4.7.1.2     The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered”
is (are) not part of the DMI.

4.7.1.3    The device(s) used to select/indicate “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI.

4.7.1.4      Intentionally deleted.

4.7.1.5    Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is not included in the following section.

4.7.2       DMI versus Mode Table

4.7.2.1.1 | X = active: For a DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column. For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column).

4.7.2.1.2 A= available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here.

4.7.2.1.3 Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system.

4.7.2.1.4 NA=Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and
outputs cannot be determined.

Acceptance of received information

Introduction

The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of which information is accepted or
rejected depending on the state of the on-board (level, mode) and the nature of the
received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill).

The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the
level and transmission media’, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information
depending on the modes”.

If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that
message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information.

Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first
considering the on-board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1], [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied,
shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from
the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level.

Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a
change of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This
implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment — still
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes
in which this information is otherwise useless.

If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all
other non-infill information in that message.

When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

Assumptions

The following tables shall be applied assuming that:

a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and
with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)

b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation,
or the balise group crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines).(see section
3.6.3)

c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A”
(Accepted) comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this
information is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is
still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed
exception1: the information “Acknowledgement of Train Data’, “Trackside
constituent system version”, "Initiation of Communication Session", "Session
Management" and “Acknowledgement of Session Termination" shall be immediately
accepted.
exception2: the information “Co-operative shortening of MA’, “Revocation of
Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected.

d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG.

e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed
(see clause 3.14.3.6)

Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be
decoded, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” is
only used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly
read, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”, if
received, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need
not to be referred to in the following tables.

In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any
further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)).
Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group
message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need
not to be referred to in the following tables.

Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), what will happen to the data to be used
by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an
external application, processed by a national function...) is outside the scope of this
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
functionality.

Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or
RBC/RBC handover

If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3 at a further location has been received, the
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see
figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages.

If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.

Note: the term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the
transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immediately)
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or
according to 4.8.2.1c (for RBC/RBC handover).

In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored.

The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:

a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition
order for a different level, OR

b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to
another Accepting RBC, OR

c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored
information is terminated

At the same time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting
RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition
buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received.

This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to
any use by the on-board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change
of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the
following principles:

a) Starting from the information currently used by on-board at the moment the
level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted.

b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information, the same
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted
outside a level/RBC transition context.

c) The information resulting from this sequential update shall then be used by the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table
4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be
accepted or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given
stop location. This decision, based on the comparison between the min safe front end
position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location,
shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).

Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the
information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see
clause 3.10.2.3) when re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information
accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.

Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time when
the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed.
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

What happens to accepted and stored information when
entering a given level

Introduction

Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a
level transition.

A level transition acts on the “status” of stored information.

In case of entering level 1, MA Request Parameters, Position Report Parameters and
Track Ahead Free Request shall be deleted.

In case of entering level 0, NTC or 1, the information “Inhibition of revocable TSRs
from balises in L2/3” shall be deleted.

For all other stored data, a level transition has no effect (void).

4.10      What happens to accepted and stored information when
entering a given mode

4.10.1       Introduction

4.10.1.1 Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a
mode transition.

4.10.1.2 A mode transition acts on the “status” of stored information.

4.10.1.3 Depending on which mode is entered, the action shall be one of the following:
a) data is deleted,
b) data is to be revalidated,
c) data is reset (set to default values)
d) data status is unchanged,

e) not relevant (the action on the data cannot be determined. This concerns the entry
in SF and IS modes)

D = Deleted TBR = To Be Revalidated U=Unchanged NR=Notrelevant R= Reset

Introduction

Scope and Purpose

This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the
scope of ERTMS/ETCS.

Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and, where convenient,
is illustrated by a flowchart.

In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures.

Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e. g. cut
off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).

National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is
retained.

Definitions

Procedures

A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems
and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or
events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.

Entities

The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the
entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.

States

States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions
and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not
completely satisfied.

Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.

Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another
one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force
branching in states.

Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is
triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the
same time. When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditions
to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

Procedure Start of mission

Introduction

The driver may have to start a mission:

a) Once the train is awake, OR

b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR
c) Once a mission is ended, OR

d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine.

The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in
Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be
already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation.

Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission
is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board
switches to Sleeping mode).

Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment

At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of
three states:

a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct)

b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong)

c) “Unknown” (no stored value available)

This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3).

Note 1: The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode".

Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table
in section 5.4.3.3.

Table of requirements for “Start of Mission” procedure

The ID numbers in the table are used for the representation of the procedure in form of
a flow chart in section 5.4.4.

Procedure

ID#

Requirements

so

The Start of Mission procedure shall be engaged when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment is in Stand-By mode with a desk open and no communication session is
established or is being established.

S1

Depending on the status of the Driver-ID, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
request the driver to enter the Driver-ID (if the Driver-ID is unknown) or shall request
the driver to revalidate or re-enter the Driver-ID (if the Driver-ID is invalid).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the driver the possibility to
enter/re-validate (depending on the status) the Train running number.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also offer the driver the possibility to
set/remove a Virtual Balise Cover.

Once the Driver-ID is entered or revalidated (E1) (possibly further to the Train running
number entry/revalidation and/or to Virtual Balise Cover setting/removal), the process
shall go to D2

D2

If both the stored position and the stored level are valid, the process shall go to D3

If the stored position or the stored level is “invalid” or “unknown”, the process shall go
to S2

D3

If the stored level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to D7

If the stored level is 0,1 or NTC, the process shall go to $10

D7

If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go
to A31

If no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go to A29

$2

If the status of the Level data is "unknown", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall request the driver to enter it.

If the status of the Level data is "invalid", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
request the driver to re-validate or re-enter the ERTMS/ETCS level.

If the entered / re-validated level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to $3

If the entered / re-validated level is 0, 1 or one of proposed NTC level(s) (see 3.18.4.2
for the levels the driver is allowed to select), the process shall go to $10

ID#

Requirements

$3

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to re-
enter the Radio Network ID. If the driver elects to do so, the on-board equipment shall
acquire an alphanumeric list of available and allowed networks, based on a request to
the Mobile Terminal(s) and:

e = If this list is empty (E3) the process shall go to A29

e If the driver selects a new Radio Network ID from the proposed list, the
registration of the Mobile Terminal(s) to this new Radio Network shall be
ordered and the status of the RBC-ID/phone number shall be immediately set
to “unknown”.

If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment shall offer the following options to the driver for the RBC-
ID/phone number:

e Only if the status of the RBC-ID/phone number is “invalid": order the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to use the last stored RBC-ID/phone
number

e Order the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to use the EIRENE short
number (trackside call routing function)

e Enter the RBC-ID/phone number (if its status is "unknown"), or revalidate/re-
enter it (if its status is “invalid”).

Once the driver has selected the first or second option or once data is validated (E5),
the process shall go to A31

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver that the Radio Network
registration has failed

This condition leads to $10 (the driver has to unlock the situation to continue e.g.
selection of new level)

$10

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to select
SH, NL, or to select Train Data Entry.

e If the driver selects SH (E12), the process shall continue in the same way as the
procedure          “Shunting          initiated          by         the          driver”.
If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting (E13), the process shall
go back to $10.

e If the driver selects NL (E10) then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch to Non Leading mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transition
between modes: transition [46]). The mission starts in NL mode (if level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment also reports the change of mode to the
RBC).

e If the driver selects Train Data Entry (E11), the process shall go to $12

e Following E10, E12, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall
delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”)

Requirements

$22

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall request an acknowledgement from the
driver for running under supervision of the selected National System. When the driver
acknowledges (E30) , the mission starts in SN mode (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

Following E30, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete
the train position data (new status: “unknown”)

$23

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall require an acknowledgement from the
driver for running in Unfitted mode. When the driver acknowledges (E31), the mission
starts in Unfitted mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes: transition
from SB to UN)

Following E31, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete
the train position data (new status: “unknown”)”

$24

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall require an acknowledgement from the
driver for running in Staff Responsible mode. When the driver acknowledges (E32),
the mission starts in SR mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes:
transition from SB to SR)

Following E32, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete
the train position data (new status: “unknown”)”

$25

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall require an acknowledgement from the
driver for running in On Sight/Limited Supervision/Shunting mode. When the driver
acknowledges (E33), the mission starts in On Sight/Limited Supervision/Shunting
mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes: transition from SB to OS,
LS or SH)

A31

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall open the session with the RBC.

D31

If the opening of the session is successful, the process shall go to D32

If the opening of the session has failed, the process shall go to A32

A32

The driver shall be informed when the on-board equipment fails to open a radio
session.

Opening of a radio session has failed if
e No connection to the RBC can be established (see section 3.5.3.7) OR

e The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, based on the system configuration
reported by the RBC, decides that compatibility is not ensured and terminates the
communication session

This condition leads to S10 (The driver has to unlock the situation to continue e.g.
selection of new level).

D32

If the stored position is valid, the process shall go to A33

If the stored position is invalid or unknown, the process shall go to A34

A33         If the train position data stored in the on-board equipment is of status “valid”, the train
position, marked as “valid” shall be transmitted to the RBC via the "SoM position
report" message.

This condition leads to $10.

A34       If the train position data stored in the on-board equipment is of status “invalid” or
"unknown", the train position, marked as “invalid” or "unknown" shall be transmitted to
the RBC via the "SoM position report" message.

The process shall then go to D33

D33        When the position report marked as "invalid" is received by the RBC, this latter shall
check whether it can validate this position report.

If the position report can be validated by the RBC, the process shall go to A35
Otherwise, if the position report was marked "unknown", or the "invalid" position report
cannot be validated by the RBC, the process shall go to D22

Note: How the RBC is able to validate the position report is a national issue, out of
the scope for this specification

A35         The RBC shall inform the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment that the reported position
is valid.

When this message is received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, the status
of the position shall be set to "valid"
The process shall go to $10.

D22         If the reported train position is "unknown", or the RBC is not able to confirm a reported
"invalid" position, the RBC shall nevertheless decide whether it accepts the train or
not.

If yes, the process shall go to A23

If no, the process shall go to A38

Note: How the RBC assumes responsibility for the train is a national issue, out of the
scope for this specification

A23        The RBC shall inform the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment that it accepts the train
although the on-board has no "valid" position information.

A24       When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is informed that the train is accepted
without valid position data, it shall delete the train position data (new status:
“unknown”)

This condition leads to $10.
A38         The RBC shall inform the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment that it rejects the train

Degraded Situations

Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has
not been taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10.

The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does
not exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while
performing the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or
when the driver needs to re-enter already captured data).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also offer the driver the following
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3:

a) only at S10 and S20 and if valid Train data is available, to select “Override”. If the
driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to the procedure “Override” and,
if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train
position data (new status: “unknown”)

b) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Driver-ID
c) only at S10 and S20,to re-enter the “Train running number”

d) only at S20, to re-enter the Train data. If the driver chooses to do so, then the
process shall go to S12.

e) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, then the
process shall go to S2

f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode
and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train
position data (new status: “unknown’).

g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process
shall go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still
invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train position data (new status:
“unknown’). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process
shall go back to S20.

h) only at $10, if valid Train Data is available, to select “Start”. If the driver chooses to
do so:
e ifthe level is 0, then the process shall go to $23.
e ifthe level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22.
e ifthe level is 1, then the process shall go to S24.
e ifthe level is 2/3 and a session is open, then the process shall go to S21.
e ifthe level is 2/3 and no session is open, then the process shall go to S24.

Procedure End of Mission

Introduction

End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment when entering specific modes (see below).

Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission:

Stand-By mode

From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL, SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode is considered as an End of Mission

Note: While in SN mode (level NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may
depend on the National System.

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode, from PT
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an on-going mission.

Sleeping mode

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Sleeping mode is
considered as an End of Mission.

Note: The transition to Sleeping mode is always made from the Stand-By mode
(refer to chapter 4, transition between modes). If the end of mission has been already
executed in Stand-by mode no further end of mission is required.

Shunting mode

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS,
LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission.

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an on-going mission.

Note: While in SN mode (level NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may

depend on the National System.

End of Mission Procedure

The procedure comprises the following steps

Step 1- MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode
dependent, see Chapter 4, section "What happens to accepted and stored information
when Entering a Mode").

If a communication session with an RIU exists:

Step 2- The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication
session

End of procedure

If a communication session with an RBC exists:

Step 2- The end of mission shall be reported to the RBC by means of the message
“End of Mission’.

Step 3- The RBC shall request to terminate the communication session.

Step 4- The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication

End of procedure

Note: For the termination of the communication session refer to chapter 3,
Management of Radio Communication.

Note: The “End of Mission” message contains a position report.

Intentionally deleted.

Degraded Situation

Level 2,3 : In case a communication session is established and no request to terminate
the communication session is received from the RBC within a fixed waiting time (see
appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after sending the “End of Mission”
message, the message shall be repeated with the fixed waiting time after each
repetition.

After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value
Data), and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the time of the last
sending of “End of Mission’, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the
communication session.

Level 2,3 : In case no communication session is open, no communication session shall
be established to report the end of mission.

Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside

General Requirements

This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.

Note: The shunting area, possibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed
according to the relevant procedure.

The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile, optionally
with a list of balises groups, which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment is in shunting mode.

The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires
a driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below.

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed.

Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from
Stand By and Post Trip)

In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the
shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is
possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment the order to switch to shunting
at the current location.

Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for
which switching to SH mode is requested.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless
the command was triggered also for other reasons).

Shunting is requested for a further location

An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent

a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,

b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC.

A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two
conditions are fulfilled:

a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile

b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or value
given in the mode profile)

Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates).

Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode, according to
the mode profile, the beginning of the shunting area shall be considered either as the
EOA (keeping the SvL given by the MA) or as both the EOA and SvL (instead of the
EOA and SvL given by the MA), with no release speed.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes).

If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area
according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement
time (refer to Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the
driver.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform
transition to Shunting mode.

Procedure Override

Introduction

In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track
circuit, failed point...), railways allow a train to pass its EOA.

For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an EOA can be required in degraded situations, e.g.

e In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).

e In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the
interface between RBCs is unavailable).

e In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two
adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).
e In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection
with the interlocking)

e In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route
cannot be set)

e In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened
due to a time-out).

In level O/NTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not
supervise the train movements.

In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Receiving an order from the
signalman to pass the EOA, the driver must then be able to inhibit this supervision.

Note: The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures.

If an EOA must be passed between announcement and execution of the level
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalman gives the order
to the driver to select “override”.

Note: Passing the EOA by using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the
train driving. Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects
“override”.

In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:
a) transmitting "stop in SR mode"

b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

d) not contained in the list of expected balises in SH mode"

e) Intentionally deleted

Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4)

Selection of “Override”
The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” (i.e.
the “Override” button becomes available) only when:

a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override”
function (national value) AND

b) The current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff
Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only) or SN
(National System) AND

c) Validated Train Data is available (except when already in Shunting mode).
Intentionally deleted.

The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.

Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered

The mode shall change as follows:

a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand-By or
Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if
the mode is already SR it remains unchanged)

b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged

c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or SN (level NTC area) the mode shall
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes)

If the mode, when activating Override, is OS, LS or FS, the former EOA shall be
retained. If the mode is SB or PT, the current position of the train front shall be
considered as the former EOA.

Note: This former EOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is no
longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the
former EOA.

The former EOA shall be deleted if:

a) the train reads the information “stop in SR mode” from a balise group OR

b) SR mode is left.

Note 1: In level 2, 3, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that
the Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is

any)

Note 2: In level 2,3, if the ERTMS/ETCS- onboard equipment is able to report the
mode change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR
mode (overriding the national value), a list of balises to be passed in SR mode (refer
to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)

Note 3: In level 2,3, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes
all emergency stop orders previously received.

In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)

The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and
only in level 0, 1, 2, 3, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed
Restriction (see 3.11.10) as long as the Override function is active.

The status “override active” shall be indicated to the driver.

As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from
EUROLOOP shall be rejected.

When “Override” is selected and Override is already active, the supervision of the time
and distance (see 5.8.4.1 a) and b)) for train trip suppression shall be re-started.

End of Override procedure
The Override procedure shall end when at least one of the following conditions is
fulfilled:

a) The "max. time for train trip suppression when Override function is triggered"
(national value) elapses after Override has been selected, OR

b

The train has run more than the "distance for train trip suppression when Override
function is triggered" (national value) after Override has been selected, OR

c) The former EOA has been passed with the min safe antenna position (calculated
by subtracting distance between active EUROBALISE antenna and the front end of
the train from the min safe front end position), OR

2

The train passes a balise group giving “stop in SR” or “stop in SH” information, OR

Procedure On-Sight

General Requirements

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the
beginning of the On Sight area.

An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode shall be requested from the driver.
The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.

On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from
Stand By and Post Trip)

In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that
gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On
Sight mode.

In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode
profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe
front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch
to On Sight mode.

The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall
be displayed to the driver.

If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is
released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another
reason(s).

Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed
cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the
train speed was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was
allowed in Full Supervision mode, in Limited Supervision mode or in Staff Responsible
mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered,
independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight
supervision (see Figure 4).

Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or Limited
Supervision mode by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = OS mode speed
limit) at the location of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral
signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the
OS mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.

On Sight is requested for a further location
The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached
yet. This occurs when:

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is
located at a further location.

b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is
located at a further location.

A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following
conditions are fulfilled:

a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.

b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or value
given in the mode profile).

c) The current mode is not On Sight
Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.

Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it is not taken back if the train leaves
the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

On Sight from Stand By or Post Trip mode

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the
driver.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform
the transition to On Sight mode.”

Exit of On Sight mode

General rule

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment exits the On Sight mode when the min safe
front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.

First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA of the current MA

This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has
the same location as the EOA of the related MA.

In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On
Sight area.

Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of
the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of
the On Sight area. This information

e can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside
scope of ERTMS/ETCS), or

e can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends
a “track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the
current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this
information to the RBC.

Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to transmit
an MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA of the current MA

Level Transitions

General requirements

Every level transition border to levels 2, 3, or NTC shall be announced to the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment via balise group or via the RBC.

A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to
the border.

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a_ level transition
announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on-board level,
it shall immediately inform the driver about the announced level transition.

Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on-board equipment may remain
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.

At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level
transition order or a conditional level transition order.

Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional
level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation.
Also sleeping units read balise groups.

If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall
still be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the
announcement.

The on-board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time.
Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a
new order to switch to a different level or to the same level but at a different location is
received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order
shall be executed.

In Shunting and Passive Shunting modes only one set of Level Transition Information

As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data
(mainly movement authority and track description data) from the transmission media of
the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is
effective.

Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS
chapter 4.8.

Note: if only track description has been received from the new media without any
movement authority, this track description still replaces the one previously received
from the current media when the transition is performed.

When the onboard has performed the level transition, further data (mainly movement
authority and track description data) received from the transmission media of the level
being left shall be rejected.

Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS
chapter 4.8.

Table of priority of trackside supported levels

Any combination of ERTMS/ETCS levels 0, NTC, 1, 2, and 3 on a given area shall be
possible.

The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional level transition
order at the border shall contain all the supported ERTMS/ETCS levels with a table of
priority. Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority.

Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels. This means that, for
example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS level 0, and is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS
level 1 and 2, the track-side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported
levels in all level transition orders and conditional level transition orders applying to that
area.

The table of priority shall list all the supported levels from the highest priority level to
the lowest one.

Intentionally deleted.

When receiving the information about all ERTMS/ETCS levels that are supported by
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall select from the table the level
with the highest priority, which is available for use by the onboard equipment.

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

The on-board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use”
as follows:

a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on-board and at least one Mobile Terminal is
available on-board, i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile
Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or
not.

b) Level NTC: the concerned National System is available on-board (if an STM is
used, refer to SUBSET-035 for further details).

c) Level 0 or 1: always.

Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment checks the
availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used)
is an implementation issue.

Examples: The table of trackside supported levels gives 2, NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1,
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board will select NTC X
level. If level 1, 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use”, it will select level 1. If level 2, 1
and 0 are “Available for use”, it will select level 2.

When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level
transition only.

If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment, it shall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the
lowest priority.

Justification: The On-board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the
driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall store the table of priority of trackside
supported ERTMS/ETCS levels.

For the train to be able to enter the new area, the old area must possess information
about at least the first section of the new area. The information may be transmitted to
the train either:

a) as an MA and track description information into the new area, or

b) as a target speed at the border location i.e. as an LOA.

When the ERTMS/ETCS communication session is open, Train Data shall be sent to
the RBC (which acknowledges the data) unless the onboard equipment is in SL or NL
mode.

If no Level 2/3 MA and track description has been received when entering the new
area, the train shall still be supervised according to the level 1 MA previously received.

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to the new level, it shall
report the new on-board level, including a position report.

If an order to connect to an RBC has been received and the train will not enter the
announced RBC area, an order to terminate the session shall be sent either from
balises or from the RBC for any route not leading to the RBC area. This is the case
both if the train turns back and if the train continues in the same direction, but on
another route.

Transition from Level 0 (Unfitted) to Level 2/3 area

An order to connect to the RBC with a given id and telephone number shall be given
via balise group in rear of the border location.

When the ERTMS/ETCS communication session is open, Train Data shall be sent to
the RBC (which acknowledges the data) unless the onboard equipment is in SL or NL
mode.

A level 2/3 MA and track description information shall be received from the RBC before
the level transition border. If not, the train shall be tripped at passage of the border, i.e.
after switching to level 2 or 3, movement is not allowed without a movement authority
(refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).

The driver is responsible for entering the level 2/3 area at a speed not exceeding the
speed limits of the unequipped line.

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to the new level, it shall
report the new on-board level, including a position report.

If an order to connect to an RBC has been received and the train will not enter the
announced RBC area, an order to terminate the session shall be sent either from
balises or from the RBC for any route not leading to the RBC area. This is the case
both if the train turns back and if the train continues in the same direction, but on

Change of Train Orientation

Introduction

The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD
position.

This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to
change the driving cab.

The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver
changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE.

The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post
Trip or in Reversing mode.

The driver uses the same engine (a mission is on-going)

The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.

Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately go to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see “End
of Mission” procedure)

When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.

When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.

The driver leaves the engine to go to another one

The described situation is the following: The train has two engines (engine A and
engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave engine. Each
engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on-board equipment is in Sleeping mode.
Note: The mode is entered when on-board equipment detects the presence of the
"remote control" signal.

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading
engine but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment
is in Non leading mode.

c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment
is in Passive Shunting mode.

Assumption: The train configuration does not change.

a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.

b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will
be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL,
afterwards engine A will be in NL mode; If before the change of train orientation
engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode.

Case "Engine B was in SL mode"

The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of
engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission
(see “End of Mission” procedure)

As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment of engine B switches to Stand-By mode.

Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of engine B shall open a
communication session (if possible) and report the mode change to the RBC.

When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure.
Case "Engine B was in NL mode"

The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches
to Non Leading mode.

Once the non leading input signal is not received any more, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment of engine B will switch to Stand-By mode (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure).

Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment enters Stand-
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.

Case "Engine B was in PS mode"

The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure". The
ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes
the desk of engine A.

The driver opens a desk in engine B, and ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to
Shunting mode.

The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is on-going)

The situation is the following: while the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in
Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting
engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.

Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk
closure”. When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall immediately go to Passive Shunting mode.

When the driver opens the desk B, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch back to Shunting mode.

When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.

Train Reversing

This procedure is intended to allow the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run
away from a danger up to a “safe” location.

The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).

While the train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be
informed that reversing is possible

If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver's intention to reverse (e.g. from a
direction controller in reverse position), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode.

If the driver acknowledges, the on-board equipment shall switch to RV mode

Once in RV mode, it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted
distance to run and a new maximum speed.

Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for
the new permitted distance to run.

Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside
that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

Joining / Splitting

Definitions

Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for being
split. The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train before splitting,
the “new train after splitting”, refers to the other part.

Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation.

Procedure “Splitting”

Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS).

Note: If splitting requires moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small
distance, this can be done even in SB mode

Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train
before splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the driver must
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting.
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 — Data Entry
/ Modification Process)

Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was
in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).
For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall open a communication
session (if possible) and report the mode change to the RBC.

Step - 2c If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5,
“end of mission” procedure).

The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the
“Start of Mission” procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility.
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible.

Procedure “Joining”

Step 1 - The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be
performed in SR, OS or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the
national procedure for joining).

Step 2 — The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be closed
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).

Step 3a — If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment remains leading and
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with
the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see
SRS chapter 3 — Data Entry / Modification Process)

Step 3b — If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). Transition to SL
mode is from SB mode.

Step 3c: If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions
between modes).

For further steps after joining refer to procedures “Start of Mission” and “Change of
Train Orientation’.

RBC/RBC Handover

Principles

Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC.

The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and
to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border.

In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border crossing,
ERTMS/ETCS trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the
new Radio Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio
Network’s configuration.

Note: In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for
communication session with “Handing Over’ RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the
one used for communication session with “Accepting” RBC.

Note: In the following sections, Radio Networks are supposed to be overlapped.

At the RBC/RBC border a balise group with an order to execute the handover
immediately shall be placed.

Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted
independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.

If the message from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall
still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location
according to the announcement information.

The on-board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC transition at a time,
therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order.

Case 1: Two communication sessions can be handled simultaneously

Overview

In the normal operation, the main functional steps needed for running from one RBC
area to another one are the following:
a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over RBC;

b) Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC;

c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

5.15.2.2 Step by step description
5.15.2.2.1 Pre-announcement

5.15.2.2.1.1 When the “Handing Over RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.

§.15.2.2.1.2 The “Handing Over’ RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC
handover.

5.15.2.2.2 Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC

5.15.2.2.2.1 A radio communication session with the Accepting RBC is opened by the on-board
equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over RBC
or from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio
communication").

§.15.2.2.2.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border crossing, the
registration to the new radio network of the second Mobile Terminal is completed
before the RBC transition order is transmitted to the on-board equipment.

5.15.2.2.3 Generation of MAs including the border

5.15.2.2.3.1 The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the movement authority
based on:

a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the
part of route related information up to the border),

b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in
advance of the border.

5.15.2.2.4 Announcement

5.15.2.2.4.1. When the train reaches the border with its max safe front end, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment sends a position report both to the “Handing Over” RBC and to
the “Accepting” RBC.

§.15.2.2.4.2 The “Handing Over’ RBC forwards the announcement information to the
“Accepting” RBC.

§.15.2.2.4.2.1 Note: Although not required for the case of two communication sessions, the
forwarding of the announcement information is executed because the “Handing Over”
RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can handle one or
two communication sessions.

5.15.2.2.5 Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC

5.15.2.2.5.1 As soon as the on-board has sent to the “Accepting” RBC the position report, it
considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC i.e. it uses information received
from the “Accepting” RBC.

5.15.2.2.5.2 When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on-board and detects
that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and
informs the “Handing Over” RBC.

5.15.2.2.6 Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC

5.15.2.2.6.1 When the min safe rear end of the train passes the location of the border, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report to the “Handing Over”
RBC.

5.15.2.2.6.2 When this position report is received by the "Handing Over” RBC, it sends an order
to terminate the session to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

5.15.2.2.7 Registration to the new Radio Network of first Mobile Terminal (optional)

5.15.2.2.7.1 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border crossing, the
registration to the new Radio Network of the first Mobile Terminal is initiated by the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment as soon as the communication session with the
"Handing Over" RBC has been terminated and the safe radio connection has been
released.

5.15.3     Case 2: Only one communication session can be handled

5.15.3.1 Overview

5.15.3.1.1 In this case, the main functional steps needed for running from one RBC area to
another one are the following:

a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over RBC;
b) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

c) Announcement of the RBC transition

d) Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC;

e) Registration to the new Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC;

f) Transfer of train supervision to the “Accepting” RBC.
5.15.3.2 Step by step description
5.15.3.2.1 Pre-announcement

5.15.3.2.1.1 When the “Handing over” RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.

§.15.3.2.1.2 The “Handing Over’ RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC
transition.

5.15.3.2.2 Generation of MAs including the border

5.15.3.2.2.1 The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the movement authority
based on (see Figure 9)

a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the
part of route related information up to the border),

b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in
advance of the border.

§.15.3.2.2.2 When it is required to send a movement authority to the train, the "Handing Over"
RBC will request from the "Accepting RBC" information needed for extending the MA
in advance of the border.

5.15.3.2.3 Announcement

5.15.3.2.3.1 When the train with its max safe front end reaches the border, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment sends a position report to the “Handing Over” RBC.

§.15.3.2.3.2 The “Handing Over’ RBC forwards the announcement information to the
“Accepting” RBC.

5.15.3.2.4 Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC

5.15.3.2.4.1 As requested by the RBC transition order, when the min safe rear end of the train
passes the location of the border, the on-board equipment sends a position report to
the “Handing Over” RBC.

5.15.3.2.4.2 When this position report is received by the “Handing Over” RBC, it sends an order
to terminate the session to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

5.15.3.2.5 Registration to the new Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC

5.15.3.2.5.1 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives the session termination
order from the “Handing Over” RBC, it terminates the session with the “Handing over”
RBC and opens a session with the “Accepting” RBC (refer to chapter 3, management
of radio communication).

§.15.3.2.5.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border crossing: as soon as
the session with the "Handing Over" RBC is terminated, the registration to the new
Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal is enforced by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment prior to the opening of a session with the “Accepting” RBC (refer to chapter
3, management of radio communication).

5.15.3.2.6 Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC

5.15.3.2.6.1 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has established a communication
session with the “Accepting” RBC and sent to the “Accepting” RBC a position report, it
considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC, i.e. it accepts only information
received from the “Accepting” RBC.

Degraded Situations

Note: If the “Handing Over’ RBC is not able to extend the MA into the area of the
“Accepting RBC”, the driver may select "override", or manually change the level to
move the train into the area of the “Accepting RBC’.

Note: If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot open a session with the
“Accepting RBC’, the train is stopped at the latest when it has reached the EOA given
by the “Handing Over” RBC. For passing the EOA the driver may select "override", or
manually change the level.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not able to terminate the session with the
“Handing Over” RBC: In case a communication session is established and no request
to terminate the session is received from the “Handing Over” RBC within a fixed
waiting time (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after sending the
position report (see 5.15.2.2.6), the position report shall be repeated with the fixed
waiting time after each repetition.

After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value
Data), and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the last sending of
the position report, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the
communication session.

Procedure passing a non protected Level Crossing

General Requirements

In case the LX is not protected, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (in FS, LS or
OS mode) shall temporarily supervise the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL
(instead of the EOA and SvL given by the MA), with no release speed.

The supervision of the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL shall be substituted
by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP under conditions depending
on whether stopping in rear of the LX start location is required or not. The conditions of
this substitution are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3.

The start location of the LX speed restriction depends on the substitution conditions,
which are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3. The end location of the LX speed restriction
shall be the LX end location.

When approaching a non protected LX, the on-board equipment shall inform the driver
about the status of the LX, as soon as:

Indication given to the driver shall remain displayed until one of the following conditions
is met:

a) information “LX is protected” is received on-board;

b) train has passed the LX end location with its min safe front end.

Stopping in rear of non protected LX is required

Once the train has stopped with its estimated front end inside the stopping area, given
by trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall no longer supervise the LX
start location as both the EOA and SvL (i.e. the ones given by the MA shall be again
supervised) and shall immediately include the LX speed restriction in the MRSP,
starting from the estimated train front end.

Passing a non stopping area

This procedure is dealing with the announcement and indication to the driver of an
area where stopping is not permitted.

As long as there are non stopping areas stored on-board, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall continuously check the current speed and position of the train whether
a full service brake command would stop the train within any of the stored non
stopping areas. This shall be achieved taking into account for each non stopping area,
two virtual SBI supervision limits (SBlp and SBlg), calculated at the estimated speed
from two SBD curves of which the feet are the start location of the non stopping area
(point D) and a location (point G) at train length distance in advance of the end location
of the non stopping area:

a) If the max safe front end is in rear of the first SBI supervision limit (SBlp) no
information related to this non stopping area shall be displayed

b) If the max safe front end is in advance of the first SBI supervision limit (SBlp) and
the min safe front end in rear of the second SBI supervision limit (SBlg), the non
stopping area related information shall be displayed to the driver according to the
following clauses 5.18.4.3, 5.18.4.4.

c) If the min safe front end is in advance of the second SBI supervision limit (SBlc), no

information related to this non stopping area shall be displayed.

When the max safe front end is in rear of the start location (point D) of the non

Procedure Limited Supervision

General Requirements

The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode
profile.

An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.

Limited Supervision is requested for current location (from modes
different from Stand By and Post Trip)

In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise
(group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and
receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately
switch to Limited Supervision mode.

In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode
profile giving a Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its
max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode.

The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver.

If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is
released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another
reason(s).

Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited
Supervision mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because
a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff
Responsible mode) then an emergency brake command could be immediately
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the LS
supervision (see Figure 22).

Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or On Sight mode
by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = LS mode speed limit) at the
location of transition to Limited Supervision mode.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in LS mode when receiving the LS
mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.

Limited Supervision is requested for a further location
The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not
reached yet. This occurs when:

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision
area that is located at a further location.

b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision
area that is located at a further location.

A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following
conditions are fulfilled:

a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of
Limited Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.

b) The speed is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national value,
or value given in the mode profile).

c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision
Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.

Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it is not taken back if the train leaves
the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

5.19.3.7 If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the Limited Supervision
area according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to LS mode and a request
for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

5.19.3.8 If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement
time (refer to Appendix A3.1) after the change to LS mode, the service brake
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

5.19.4     Limited Supervision from Unfitted or SN mode

5.19.4.1 The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN
mode). A transition to Limited Supervision mode can therefore earliest occur at a
transition of level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

here.

Limited Supervision from Stand By or Post Trip mode

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited
Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this
case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement
from the driver.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform

the transition to Limited Supervision mode.

Exit of Limited Supervision mode

General rule

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment exits the Limited Supervision mode when the
min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.

First case: The Limited supervision area ends at the EOA of the current MA

This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode
Profile has the same location as the EOA of the related MA.

In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the
Limited Supervision area.

Second case: The Limited Supervision area ends before the EOA of the current
MA

In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Limited
Supervision area.

When exiting the Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

Scope

The chapter defines the composition of envelope of legally operated system versions,
i.e. all the ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate
and that on-board equipment shall support.

By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters shall be applicable
regardless of the system version operated; this chapter includes the exceptions to
these clauses and the additional clauses, which shall apply when the system version of
some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a version
number older than the last one introduced.

Trackside requirements in relation to older system versions

Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1

Introduction

The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this
release of the SRS.

Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it
shall be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0, and 1.1

Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use the value M_VERSION = 2.0 for balises.

Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area
support the system version number X = 2 and the on-board requirements related to the
trackside information marked with 2.0 are applicable regardless of the operated
version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter operates
with the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC).

Exceptions to chapter 3

Clause 3.5.3.11 shall be replaced with:"In case the RBC is the initiator, the first
message from RBC to on-board shall include a request for acknowledgement and shall

mo

have the time-stamp and the LRBG identity set to "unknown".
Section 3.6.2.4 shall not apply.

Clause 3.7.1.1 b) shall be replaced with: “When needed, limitations related to the
movement authority, i.e. Mode profile for On Sight or Shunting and signalling related
speed restriction (see sections 3.12.4 and 3.11.6). Mode profile and Signalling related
Speed restriction shall always be sent together with the MA to which the information
belongs”

In clause 3.7.1.1 c), the bullet “Optionally Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted
braking distance (see section 3.11. 11)” shall not apply.

In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “LX speed restrictions” shall not apply.

In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “Inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises in L2/3 (from
RBC only)” shall not apply.

Clause 3.9.3.2 shall be replaced with: “The orders shall be sent via balise groups.”
Clause 3.9.3.8.1 shall not apply.

Clause 3.11.3.2.2 c) shall not apply.

On-board requirements in relation to older system versions

Introduction

This section covers the following situations:

a) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number
X=1

b) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number
X = 2, but still transmitting some balise/loop/RIU information related to system
version number X = 1 (see section 6.5.2)

c) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number
X = 2, but on-board equipment has established a communication session with a
neighbouring RBC certified to system version number X = 1

Specific requirements for on-board operating with system version number
X=1
Exceptions to chapter 3

Clause 3.12.3.4.7.2 shall be replaced with: “If the driver acknowledges before the end
condition is fulfilled, the on-board equipment shall consider the driver
acknowledgement as always ending the text display, regardless of the end condition
defined in 3.12.3.4.3.1”.

Exceptions to chapter 4

Clause 4.4.11.1.3 d) shall be replaced with: “balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in
SR’. This order shall immediately trip the train.”

Condition [54] in table 4.6.3 shall be replaced with: “(reception of information “stop if in

For information received from trackside, the message consistency check shall be
achieved taking into account the exceptions to chapters 7 and 8, as described in
sections 6.5.1.5 and 6.5.1.6.

For information received from trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
use the translation tables defined here below, in order to use the information as if it
had been elaborated in compliance with the current chapters 7 and 8.

Packets received from balise, loop, RIU, RBC

In the table below, the translation of information may depend on the on-board operated
system version at the time the information is received and accepted on-board.

When a level transition or an RBC/RBC handover is announced, the information stored
on-board in the transition buffer shall be translated according to system version
operated on-board at the time the information is released from the transition buffer (i.e.
the system version operated by the trackside infrastructure, towards which the train is
running).

Depending on the packet, the action can be:
a) data is unchanged,
b) data is rejected,
c) data is translated,

)

d) not relevant

R= Rejected T = Translated      U = Unchanged     NR = Not relevant

7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language

7.3.1 Introduction

7.3.1.1     The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise
and loop airgaps.

7.3.1.2     The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages
are described in chapter 8).

7.3.1.3     Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally,
depending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior
verification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details.

7.3.2 Definition of Variables

7.3.2.1    Variables shall be used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in
minor units. The whole variable has one type (meaning).

7.3.2.2   Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the
variable.

7.3.2.3     Special values have always the highest values in a variable (eg. 11...111 = “unknown’).

7.3.2.4    Spare values shall be located between the normal and special values in the variable
range

7.3.2.5    Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as
described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different
names.

7.3.2.6     All variable definitions shall be independent of the transport media over which they are
used, if used in more than one media.

7.3.2.7      Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement.
7.3.2.8      One bit variables (Boolean) shall always use 0 for false and 1 for true.

7.3.2.9    Offsets for numerical values shall be avoided (0 shall be used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.)
except where justified.

7.3.2.10 | When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall
be transmitted first.

7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

7.3.3 Definition of Packets

7.3.3.1

7.3.3.2

Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal

structure.

This structure consists of a packet header with:

e Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the
orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:

Number

Direction

Length
Scale

Information

NID_PACKET

Q_DIR

L_PACKET

Q_SCALE

Packet identifier

Specifies the validity direction
of transmitted data

Number of bits in the packet

Specifies which distance scale
is used for all distance
information within the packet.

There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.

Well defined set(s) of variables.

e Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables.
The packet structure is as follows:

Number                NID_PACKET                        Packet identifier
Length                  L_PACKET                             Number of bits in the packet
Scale            Q_SCALE                  Specifies which distance scale
is used for all distance
information within the packet.

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.

Information  —s fu...                                      Well defined set(s) of variables.

The packet definition does not change when transmitted over different transmission
media.

All currently not defined packet identifiers are reserved for future use and shall be
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values). Exception: reception of information
only differing by Y with regards to the highest system version number X supported by
on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11). All future packet definitions shall follow the above
defined structure.

Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram”
do not follow the above defined structure.

N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or group of variables which
follow.

If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow.
Two nested levels of iterations can exist.

If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a variable is
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition

Note: Row “Transmitted by” in the description of a packet specifies which
ERTMS/ETCS trackside device (balise, loop, RIU, RBC) can transmit this packet.
“Any” means that the packet can be transmitted by a balise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU.

Note: Row “Transmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which
ERTMS/ETCS trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

M_AXLELOADCAT

Axle load category

Description

The values allocated below correspond to a list of increasing axle load categories (i.e. B1 > HS17, B2 >
B1, D2 > C4, ....etc) and it is used by the on-board equipment to compare its axle load category with the
axle load category sent by trackside.

For the underlying meaning of the axle load categories listed below (with the exception of HS17) refer to
CR INF TSI.

The category HS17 (axle load <= 17t) corresponds to a static load per axle only, as specified in HS RST
TSI clause 4.2.3.2. The introduction of this artefact is necessary to ensure backward compatibility,
without any negative performance impact, in case ASPs are used on lines operated with system version
X=1.

Introduction

Scope and Purpose

This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS
functions.

Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such
as medium-specific use constraints (e.g. distance between track-circuit and balise...),
as well as functions (e.g. detection of balise reference, time and location stamp,
identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio
connection...) and performance of the transmission media.

Definitions

Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop).

A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the
transmission medium).

A Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram
from balise number 1 first), each telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A
Eurobalise telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of
Packets.

Rules

Common Rules

A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) shall be composed of
1. One Header,

2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio),

3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio),

4. Optional Packets as needed by application.

The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message
format (from top to bottom).

The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given
by the message.

Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such
packet.

Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of balise group
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of
LRBG (radio transmission).

It shall be forbidden to send more instances of the same packet type for the same
direction in the same message.

Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).

Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed
Restriction). In case of revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary
speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be
different.

Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The
identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR)
transmitted in the same message shall be different.

Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is
to be considered as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a
balise group shall have identical content per direction.

8.4.1.4.5 Exception 5: A message can contain several packets 88 (Level Crossing information).
The identities of the corresponding Level Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in
the same message shall be different.

8.4.1.4.6 Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254
(default balise, loop or RIU information).

8.4.1.4.7 Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 145
(Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction).

8.4.1.4.8 Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0
(Virtual Balise Cover marker).

8.4.1.4.9 Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6
(Virtual Balise Cover order). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C)
of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different.

8.5        List of radio Messages

8.5.1       Introduction

8.5.1.1     This section identifies the radio messages with corresponding Message Identifier
(“Mes. Id.”) and Message Name. It also gives a list of the version-invariant messages.

8.5.1.2    “Type” defines whether a message is to be sent as normal priority (N) or as high
priority data (E), as defined in Euroradio specifications.

8.5.2       Train to Track radio messages
