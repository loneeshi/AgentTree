Introduction

1.3           Introduction

1.3.1.1      Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.

1.3.1.2   Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are
rethinking their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which
ATC systems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce
standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail
Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).

1.4       Advantages of an International Interoperable System

1.4.1.1      The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:
e Cross border interoperability.
e Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.
e Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.

e Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling
exploitation of maximum track capacity.

e The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.

e Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the
world market.

e Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic
management.

1.5       About this Document

1.5.1.1     The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System
(ETCS) from a technical point of view.

1.5.1.2    Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM's) over a transition period. They might be removed
in a future edition of the standard.

1.5.1.3     To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated
and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively

3.6.0                                                                             Chapter 1

trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level.

1.5.1.4   For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside
the scope of the SRS.

1.6       How to Read and Use the SRS

1.6.1.1     The SRS covers 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this
introduction.

1.6.1.2    All readers may need to refer to the Glossary of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET-
023).

1.7           Requirements

1.7.1.1  This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the technical
interoperability. This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally
identified as containing ERTMS/ETCS on-board and/or ERTMS/ETCS trackside
requirements (see details in chapter 9).

1.7.1.2     The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated requirements,
with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control-Command and
Signalling TSI and in this SRS.

1.7.1.3   For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined
according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs.
In any case, the requirements of this SRS, which are allocated to the trackside and
related to the implemented functions, shall be respected.

1.7.1.4      Intentionally deleted.

1.7.1.5      Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not
generate any interoperability problems.

1.8        Contents of the SRS

1.8.1.1    The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System
(ETCS) of ERTMS.

1.8.1.2     This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find
the relevant chapters.

1.8.2        Chapter 1:       Introduction

1.8.2.1     Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of
the SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter.

1.8.3       Chapter 2:      Basic System Description

1.8.3.1      Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure.
1.8.3.2      Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels.

1.8.3.3      Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements.

1.8.4        Chapter 3:       Principles

1.8.4.1     Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to
onboard and trackside subsystems.

1.8.4.2      The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.

1.8.5       Chapter 4:      Modes and Transitions

1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all
transitions between modes.

1.8.6        Chapter 5:       Procedures

1.8.6.1   Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for
interoperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS
onboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to
another.

1.8.7       Chapter 6:      Management of older System Versions

1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and lists the
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other
chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used by the
trackside subsystem.

1.8.8        Chapter 7:       ERTMS/ETCS Language

1.8.8.1     Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow
over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is
described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

1.8.9        Chapter 8:       Messages

1.8.9.1    Chapter 8 defines the application protocol (format and content of messages, logical
sequence for radio) necessary to achieve technical interoperability.

1.8.9.2    The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protocol and the content of
messages.

1.8.10      Chapter 9:      Classification of the SRS clauses

1.8.10.1 | Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1
to 8 of the SRS.

1.8.10.2 In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment with the SRS, it identifies which clauses contain requirements allocated to
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either
because they contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or
because they are of another type.

System structure

Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system will have to be
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.

This defines two subsystems, the on-board subsystem and the trackside subsystem.
The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of:

a
b

the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification;

the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification;
c
d

other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3),

external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no
interoperability requirement will be established.

be composed of:
a) balise
b) lineside electronic unit

c) the radio communication network (GSM-R)
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC)
e) Euroloop

f) Radio infill unit

g) Key Management Centre (KMC)

h) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
2.5.1.2     Balise

2.5.1.2.1 The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on-board
subsystem.

2.5.1.2.2 The balise is based on the existing Eurobalise specifications. These documents are
included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications.

2.5.1.2.3 The balises provides the up-link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside
to the on-board subsystem.

2.5.1.2.4 The balises can provide fixed messages or, when connected to a lineside electronic
unit, messages that can be changed.

2.5.1.2.5 The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group.

2.5.1.3      Lineside electronic unit

2.5.1.3.1_ The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems.

2.5.1.4     Trackside radio communication network (GSM-R)

2.5.1.4.1. The GSM-R radio communication network is used for the bi-directional exchange of
messages between on-board subsystems and RBC or radio infill units.

The RBC is a computer-based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train
on basis of information received from external trackside systems and on basis of
information exchanged with the on-board subsystems.

The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the
safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the responsibility of
the RBC.

The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange
between the RBC and the on-board subsystem.

Euroloop

The Euroloop subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in
advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction.

The Euroloop subsystem is composed of an on-board functionality and by one or more
trackside parts.

Radio infill Unit

The RADIO INFILL subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling
information in advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction.

The RADIO INFILL subsystem is composed of an on-board functionality and by one or
more trackside parts (named RADIO INFILL Unit).

KMC

The role of the KMC is to manage the cryptographic keys, which are used to secure
the EURORADIO communications between the ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipments, RBCs and RIUs).

PKI

The role of the PKI is to manage and distribute digital certificates, so as to allow a
secure on-line distribution of cryptographic keys between KMCs and from a KMC to the
ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipments, RBCs and RIUs).

On-board subsystem

Depending of the application level (see further sections), the on-board subsystem can
be composed of:
a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment;

b) the on-board part of the GSM-R radio system;

2.5.2.2.1_ The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is a computer-based system that supervises
the movement of the train to which it belongs, on basis of information exchanged with
the trackside subsystem.

2.5.2.2.2 The interoperability requirements for the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment are
related to the functionality and the data exchange between the trackside subsystems
and the on-board subsystem and to the functional data exchange between the on-
board subsystem and:
a) the driver;
b) the train;
c) the onboard part of the existing national train control system(s).

2.5.2.3      Onboard radio communication system (GSM-R)

Levels and transitions

Introduction

The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related
to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on-
board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on-board
equipment respectively.

Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their
strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance.
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.

For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is
used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines equipped with train
control system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.

Definitions

A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment always co-operates with the
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.

All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules.

ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:

e ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not
equipped with any train control system (ERTMS/ETCS or national system) or on a
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under
their supervision is currently not possible)

e ERTMS/ETCS Level NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line
equipped with a national system)

e ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally
Euroloop or Radio infill)

e ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on
a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and
Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside

se。 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train
integrity supervision based on information received from the train)

2.6.2.4      It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for
example to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains
equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which
is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.

2.6.3       ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0
2.6.3.1      General description
2.6.3.1.1 Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or
national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not
possible (e.g. commissioning or on-board/trackside failed components).
2.6.3.1.2 In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and
therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give
movement authorities to the driver.
2.6.3.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.
2.6.3.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.
2.6.3.1.5 Level 0 uses no track-train transmission except Eurobalises to announce/command
level transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except
certain special commands are interpreted.
2.6.3.1.6 No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data
has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to
ERTMS/ETCS equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

ERTMS/ETCS Application Level NTC

General description

Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with
national train control and speed supervision systems.

Train control information generated trackside by the national train control system is
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national
system.

Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the
performance and functionality of the underlying systems.

Intentionally deleted.

The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying
national systems.

Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to
ERTMS/ETCS.

Level NTC uses no  ERTMS/ETCS _ track-train information except to
announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise
transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read.

The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying
national system. The active national system is indicated to the driver as part of that
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a
level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed.

A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level.

Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it,
in order to perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give
access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.

Intentionally deleted.

ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1

General description

ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as
an overlay on an underlying signalling system.

Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via
Eurobalises.

ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also
protects against overrun of the authority.

Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.

Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices.
The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information.

If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has
to observe the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be
permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release
speed.

Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.

Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi-continuous
infill is provided.

Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is
available and even at standstill.

Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the
operation without release speed.

ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3

General description
ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 is a radio based train control system.

Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via
Euroradio.

ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also
protects against overrun of the authority.

Train position and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside radio block
centre in co-operation with the train (which sends position reports and train integrity
information).

Level 3 is based on Euroradio for track to train communication and on Eurobalises as
spot transmission devices mainly for location referencing.

The trackside radio block centre which provides the information to the trains knows
each train individually by the ERTMS/ETCS identity of its leading ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment.

Note: Lineside signals are not foreseen to be used when operating in Level 3.

Eurobalises for mainly location referencing.

Main ERTMS/ETCS trackside function:

Knowing each train within an RBC area by its ERTMS/ETCS identity.

Following each trains location within an RBC area.

Route locking and route releasing based on information received from the trains.
Determine movement authorities for each train individually.

Transmit movement authorities and track description to each train individually.

Handing over of train control between different RBC’s at the RBC-RBC borders.

On-board equipment:

Onboard equipment with Eurobalise and Euroradio transmissions.

Train integrity proving system.

Main ERTMS/ETCS on-board functions:

The train reads Eurobalises and sends its position relative to the detected balises to
the radio block centre.

The train monitors train integrity (external function, not part of ERTMS/ETCS) and
sends this information to the radio block centre.

The train receives a movement authority and the track description via Euroradio
relating to a balise.

Selection of the most restrictive value of the different speeds permitted at each
location ahead.

2.6.8       Level transitions

2.6.8.1      An ERTMS/ETCS equipment which is not isolated always operates in one of the above
described levels. All transitions between these levels are performed according to
defined functions and procedures.

2.6.8.2     Additional national functions and rules which might be used by an individual railway to
for example prevent not equipped trains from entering a level 2/3 area are not
specified here and have to be implemented outside ERTMS/ETCS.

2.6.8.3      The following table shows all possible transitions (marked with Grey):

Table 1: Possible level transitions.

a) Transitions between level NTC and level NTC describe the switching from one
national system to another national system.

b) Transitions between level 2 and level 2 respectively between level 3 and level 3
describe the handover between RBC’s.

3.3          Introduction

3.3.1       Scope and purpose

3.3.1.1    The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.

3.3.1.2     The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general
and functional terms.

3.3.1.3   The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification
number.

3.3.1.4     Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as
requirements.

3.4        Balise configuration and linking

3.4.1        Balise Configurations - Balise Group Definition

3.4.1.1      A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises.

3.4.1.2      In every balise shall at least be stored:
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise
b) The number of balises inside the group
c) The balise group identity.

3.4.1.3    The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the
group.
3.4.2        Balise Co-ordinate System

3.4.2.1.1_ Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system.

3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse
direction) is identified as balise group orientation.

3.4.2.2      Balise groups composed of two or more balises

3.4.2.2.1 The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise
number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group.

3.4.2.2.2 The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise
numbers.

more balises (with "inherent" co-ordinate system)

3.4.2.3.3 Level 2/3:

3.4.2.3.3.1    If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot evaluate the orientation of the last
balise group detected, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is
available to identify the orientation of the co-ordinate system of this single balise group,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position by means of a position
report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG
and the “previous LRBG’,, if any.

3.4.2.3.3.1.1 Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a
co-ordinate system to this single balise group.

3.4.2.3.3.2 | When a single balise group is detected and the previous LRBG is known, the
position report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move
from the “previous LRBG” towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG):
directional information in the position report pointing in the same direction as the
direction reference shall be reported as “nominal”, otherwise as “reverse”.

3.4.2.3.3.3 If the “previous LRBG “ is not known, the “previous LRBG” and all directional
information of the position report based on two balise groups shall be reported as
“unknown”.

3.4.2.3.3.4 1 a new single balise group (BG2), different from the current LRBG (BG1),

3.4.2.3.3.7 For single balise groups reported as LRBG and stored according to 3.6.2.2.2c,
awaiting an assignment of a co-ordinate system, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall be able to discriminate if a single balise has been reported more than
once and with different “previous LRBGs” to the RBC.

3.4.2.3.3.7.1 Note: For a single balise group reported as LRBG awaiting the assignment of a co-
ordinate system also the rules for LRBGs reported to the RBC (see 3.6.2.2.2) apply.

3.4.2.3.3.8 A co-ordinate system assignment received from trackside shall be rejected by the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment if the referred LRBG is memorised (see 3.6.2.2.2c)
to have been reported more than once and with different “previous LRBGs’.

3.4.2.3.3.8.1 Note: If a single balise group is memorised, according to 3.6.2.2.2c, more than
once, and with different “previous LRBGs’”, the assignment of the co-ordinate system is
ambiguous.

3.4.3       Balise Information Types and Usage

3.4.3.1    In level 1, all information to the on-board system is given from balise groups or
additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units (see section 3.9). In level 2/3,
balise groups are mostly used for location information.

3.4.3.2     A balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either for nominal or for reverse
direction, or may contain information valid for both directions. In level 1, this
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5):

a) Non-infill
b) Intentionally deleted
c) Infill.
3.4.3.2.1 Intentionally deleted.
3.4.3.2.2 Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise
group.

3.4.3.3     Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of
at least two balises shall be used.

3.4.4          Linking

3.4.4.1        Introduction

3.4.4.1.1 Aim of linking:

e To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action.

e To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise.
e To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4).

3.4.4.1.2 A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in
advance.

3.4.4.1.2.1    Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term
linked also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains
repositioning information marked accordingly.

3.4.4.2      Content of linking information

3.4.4.2.1 Linking information shall be composed of:
a) The identity of the linked balise group.

b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

SUBSET-026-3                                              System Requirements Specification                          Page 14/204

c) The accuracy of this location.
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises.

d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or
reverse).

e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the expected balise
group.

3.4.4.2.1.1   "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation
window of the furthest announced balise group.

3.4.4.2.2 Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information

3.4.4.2.2.1  Intentionally deleted.
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2.

3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known
because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise
group.

3.4.4.2.3 For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to
be used in case of data inconsistencies:

a) Train trip (Trip mode, see Chapter 4)
b) Command service brake

c) No reaction

For further details see section 3.16.2.

3.4.4.3      Unlinked Balise Groups

3.4.4.3.1 A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.

3.4.4.3.2 Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.
3.4.4.3.3 Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier.
3.4.4.4      Rules related to linking

3.4.4.4.1. When no linking information is used on-board, all balise groups shall be taken into
account.

3.4.4.4.2 When linking information is used on-board, only balise groups marked as linked and
included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken
into account.

When linking information is used on-board and the expected balise group is referred
in the linking information with a balise group with ID “unknown”, a balise group marked
as linked shall only be taken into account if:

a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single
balise groups), AND

b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation,
AND

c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information.

The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in

the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from

e when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of
the balise group

until

e the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the
balise group

taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account.

Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group
are defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy.

Note: The interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the
expectation window.

In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location
shall start from the previously linked balise group.

The on-board equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise
only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking
information.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall
expect the next one announced in the linking information (if any) when:

a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window

b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1

Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check its linking consistency
and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the further next balise
group announced in the linking information.

Management of Radio Communication

Note: the following section refers to the behaviour of the user application interacting
with Euroradio protocols. How the messages are actually transported from the sender
to the receiver user application is not relevant for this description.

General

Each communication session managed by an entity allows the exchange of data with
only one other entity.

Note: in the following sections reference is made to safe radio connections, whose
definition and management is contained in Euroradio specification.

Note: The information Initiation of a Communication Session and Version not
Compatible (see sections 3.5.2.4 and 3.17) are the same in every system version.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to manage simultaneous
communication sessions with at least two different entities.

Establishing a communication session

Only the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can initiate a communication session.
Intentionally deleted.

Note: Only communication sessions between an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
and a trackside equipment (RBC or Radio Infill Unit) are considered here.

The on-board shall establish a communication session
a) At Start of Mission (only if level 2 or 3).
b) If ordered from trackside.

c) If a mode change, neither considered as an End of Mission nor triggered from
condition g) below, has to be reported to the RBC (only if level 2 or 3)

d) If the driver has manually changed the level to 2 or 3
e) When the train front reaches the end of an announced radio hole

f) When the previous communication session is considered as terminated due to loss
of safe radio connection (refer to 3.5.4.2.1)

g) When a Start of Mission procedure, during which no communication session could
be established, is completed in level 2 or 3

h) When outside the Start of Mission procedure, the driver has manually selected the
RBC contact information (only if level 2 or 3)

The order to contact a Radio Infill Unit shall include

a) The identity of the Radio Infill Unit

b) The telephone number of the Radio Infill Unit

c) The action to be performed (establish/terminate the session).

The establishment of a communication session shall be performed according to the
following steps:

a) The on-board shall request the set-up of a safe radio connection with the trackside.
If this request is part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure or is related to the
establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c), it shall be
repeated until successful or a defined number of times (see Appendix A.3.1).

If this request is not part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure and is not related
to the establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c), it shall
be repeated until successful.

A request shall be repeated immediately after EURORADIO has indicated that
setting up the safe radio connection has failed.

3.5.4       Maintaining a communication session

3.5.4.1    When a communication session is established, in case of a loss of the safe radio
connection, i.e., if the disconnection has not been ordered (see 3.5.5.1), the involved
entities shall consider the communication session still established for a defined time.
The defined time shall start as soon as EURORADIO has indicated the loss of the safe
radio connection.

3.5.4.2     When EURORADIO indicates the loss of the safe radio connection, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment shall immediately try to set-up a new safe radio connection.

3.5.4.2.1 If the safe radio connection is not re-established after the defined time (as defined in
A.3.1), both, on-board equipment and trackside, shall consider the session as
terminated.

3.5.4.3     The attempts shall be repeated, until at least one of the following conditions is met:
e The safe radio connection is set-up.
e The session is considered as terminated.
e The train passes the location indicated in the RIU order “Terminate the

b) Following driver entry of a new Radio Network identity

c) If ordered from the trackside

3.5.6.2    When powered-off, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall memorize the last
received Radio Network identity (from trackside or from driver) and shall use it when
powered-up again.

3.5.6.3    If no Radio Network identity received from trackside or from driver could have been
memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or at
very first power-up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile
Terminal(s) to a default Radio Network.

3.5.6.3.1 Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default Radio Network identity (on-board
equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is
implementation dependent.

3.5.6.3.2 Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is powered-up in an area not covered by
the memorized or default Radio Network, attempts to register to this Radio Network will
be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt is
successful or a new Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from driver,
preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from registering to any unwanted Radio Network.

3.5.6.4      Intentionally deleted.

3.5.6.5     On reception of the trackside order, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately order the Radio Network registration of each Mobile Terminal that fulfils
the following conditions:
a) it is not yet registered to the ordered Radio Network, AND
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND
Cc) no safe radio connection is being set-up

3.5.6.6   If a Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the Radio Network ordered by
trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall initiate the Radio Network registration once communication session is
terminated and safe radio connection is released.

3.5.6.7    If no Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a Radio Network, any order to contact an
RBC or an RIU received from trackside shall be rejected by ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment.

3.5.7       Safe Radio Connection Indication

3.5.7.1     The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the

In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use a “connection status”
timer (see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication
status “Connection Lost/Set-Up failed”.

Note: The purpose of the “connection status” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as
soon as the first request to set-up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is
sent:

a) for what regards the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4.

b) for what regards maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4

If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the requests to set-up
a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as
described in Table 1 according to the conditions in Table 2 (see section 4.6.1 for
details about the symbols).

For the case of an RBC/RBC transition, the safe radio connection indicated to the
driver shall switch from the indication status of the safe radio connection with the
Handing over RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following
conditions is met:

a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report directly to the
Accepting RBC with its maximum safe front end having passed the border, see
3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC),

b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the minimum
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, see 3.15.1.2.7 and 3.15.1.3.9.

Note: During an RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table
and a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each
RBC.

For the case of safe radio connection with RIU’s, the safe radio connection indicated to
the driver shall be the one related to the current infill area.

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

Justification: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may
not be known to the RBC.

If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e. the side of the
active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train
orientation shall be as when a cab was last active.

The “train orientation relative to LRBG’ is defined as the train orientation related to the
orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either “nominal” or “reverse”.

Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction controller position.

Location of Data Transmitted to the On-Board Equipment

Data Transmitted by Balises

All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer to the location reference
and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs.

Exception: Regarding infill information the section 3.6.2.3.1 shall apply.
Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC

All location and profile data transmitted from the RBC shall refer to the location
reference and orientation of the LRBG given in the same message.

For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met:

a) The on-board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference
when reporting its position to the RBC (in the following termed as LRBGons). Only
e balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking
information, if linking information is used on-board
or

e the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this
balise group was passed

shall be regarded.

b) The RBC shall use a balise group which was reported by the on-board equipment
as a reference (in the following termed as LRBGarac). At a certain moment LRBGrec
and LRBGone can be different.

c) The on-board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at
least eight LRBGons last reported to the RBC.

Exception to a): When on-board position is unknown or when position data has
been deleted during SoM procedure, the on-board equipment shall use an LRBG
identifier set to "unknown" until the onboard has validated its position again by passing
a balise group.

3.6.2.2.2.2 Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position
(as per 3.6.2.2.2.1) or during SoM procedure an invalid position which it is not able to
confirm, the RBC shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a
position report from the onboard having validated its position by passing a balise
group.

3.6.2.2.2.3   Regarding c): From the time it has reported an unknown position, or an invalid
position during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message
with an LRBG not set to “unknown”, the on-board equipment shall also be able to
accept messages from the RBC containing LRBG “unknown”.

3.6.2.3      Data transmitted as Infill information
3.6.2.3.1 All location and profile data transmitted as infill information shall refer to the location

3.6.2.4.1 It shall be possible to transmit non-infill location data by loop, which refers to a balise
group as location reference.

3.6.2.4.1.1     Note: Regarding infill information see section 3.6.2.3.

3.6.2.4.2 The orientation of data transmitted by a loop is determined by the EOLM information

interpreted.

3.6.3        Validity direction of transmitted Information

3.6.3.1        General

3.6.3.1.1 The direction for which transmitted information is valid shall refer to:
a) the direction of the LRBG for information sent by radio

b) the direction of the balise group sending the information.

3.6.3.1.2 Data transmitted to the on-board equipment (by balise or radio) shall be identified as
being valid for

a) both directions
b) the nominal direction
c) the reverse direction

of the referenced balise group.
3.6.3.1.2.1 Deleted.

3.6.3.1.3 When receiving information from any transmission medium, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment shall only take into account information valid for its orientation. Other
information shall be ignored. Exception: for SL, PS and SH engines, balise group
crossing direction shall be considered.

3.6.3.1.3.1    If the train position is unknown, data received from any transmission medium valid
for one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment.
Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8).

3.6.3.1.4 If no co-ordinate system has been assigned to a single balise group, data transmitted
by trackside, which refers to that balise group requiring the co-ordinate system to be
known (i.e. all data which are only valid for one direction (nominal or reverse)) shall be
rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Data valid for both directions shall
be evaluated (see section 4.8).

3.6.3.1.4.1   Exception: if not rejected due to balise group message consistency check (see
3.16.2.4.4.1 and 3.16.2.5.1.1), data to be forwarded to a National System (see section
3.15.6) shall be accepted. Justification: the co-ordinate system of the balise group
might be known to the National System by other means inherent to the National
System itself.

b) For distance (1) the previously received data shall be used.

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.

According to Figure 12 the structure for non-continuous profile data shall allow to
contain multiple elements (value(n) for length(n)) inside the profile.

a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as
unsigned incremental values, each increment representing the distance between
starts of element (n) and element (n-1).

b) For distance (1) the previously received data (or initial data/default values, see

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.

d) Note: There is no relationship between length of element (n-1) and distance (n), i.e.,
elements may overlap.

It shall be possible for the RBC to shift the location reference, e.g., after a change of
train orientation or running direction.

Justification: Refer to Figure 13. To make it possible to shift the location reference if
— due to the location of the LRBG and the start location — distance (1) would become a

shall take into account

a) On-board over-reading amount and under-reading amount (odometer accuracy plus

Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the
LRBG depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment until it is reset when another
balise group becomes the LRBG.

The value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information if
available, if not, by the corresponding National Value, or the corresponding Default
Value if the National Value is not applicable.

When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8)
location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received balise
group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be relocated by
subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the
location related information:

a) the distance between the reference balise group of the location related information
and the LRBG, retrieved from linking information if it is available and it includes both
the reference balise group and the LRBG, OR

b) in all other cases, the estimated travelled distance between the reference balise
group of the location related information and the LRBG.

Justification: it is always the trackside responsibility to provide linking in due course,
knowing this rule; if the location related information is to be used in situations where
linking is not provided (e.g. TSR transmitted by balise group marked as unlinked), the
trackside can include provisions, if deemed necessary, when engineering the distance
information.

geographical position information (if any) by this new received one, continuing the
ongoing geographical position calculation until at least one of the condition of 3.6.6.9
applies.

Geographical position information shall always use a balise group as geographical
position reference balise group and if needed an offset from that balise group. A
geographical position reference balise group shall be either:

a) part of the last reported balise groups memorised on-board, in case the information
is transmitted by radio, OR

b) the balise group transmitting the information, in case the information is transmitted
by balise group, OR

c) any balise group not yet passed at the time of reception of the information.

In case the information is received by radio and at least one of the announced
geographical position reference balise group(s) is part of the last reported balise
groups memorised on-board, the on-board equipment shall use the data related to the
most recently reported balise group.

From the currently stored geographical position information, the track kilometre
reference given for a geographical reference location shall become applicable if the
train has detected the related geographical reference balise group and has travelled
the offset distance from this reference balise group.

The announced and not applicable geographical references shall be deleted on-board
if the train changes orientation.

The distance travelled from the geographical reference location shall be taken into
account when calculating the geographical position.

In cases where the track kilometre is not incremental (jumps, changes in counting
direction, scaling error) the reported position might be wrong between the point of
irregularity and the next new reference.

In cases where single balise groups are used as a reference for geographical position
information and where no linking information is available (and therefore no orientation
can be assigned to the balise group), the on-board equipment shall ignore the
geographical position information related to these single balise groups.

Intentionally deleted.

The on-board equipment shall continue calculating the position from a track kilometre
reference (i.e. this track kilometre reference shall remain applicable) until:

a) a new track kilometre reference becomes applicable, OR
b) it is told not to do so, OR

c) the calculated geographical position becomes negative, OR

3.8        Movement authority

3.8.1       Characteristics of a MA

3.8.1.1      The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17:
Structure of an MA):

a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to
move.

b) When the Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority is zero, the End of
Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority); when the target speed is not
zero, it is called the LOA (Limit of Authority). This non zero target speed can be time
limited.

c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement
Authority that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a
hazardous situation.

d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location
beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a
risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined
time.

e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity
of the End of Movement Authority, when the target speed is zero. One release
speed can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap.
Release speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4).

f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.

e A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is
called the Section time-out.

e In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the
MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.

3.8.1.2    The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.
3.8.1.3     Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):
e the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to
fixed block principles)
e the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to
moving block principles)

e the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of
operation)

Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.

Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:

a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests
a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.

b) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.

c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the
overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that
the train has successfully stopped before its End of Movement Authority. If the
overlap is still unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the
overlap.

Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero, a target speed
higher than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the
trackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the
train from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the
responsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.

MA request to the RBC

It shall be possible for the on-board equipment to request a new Movement Authority
from the RBC.

The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.

In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:

a) A defined time before the train reaches the perturbation location assuming it is
running at the warning speed (see section 3.13.11 for details).

b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap
timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires.

3.8.2.3.1 Regards to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggered when the train
front has passed the resulting location (regards a)/ time (regards b)

3.8.2.4      The parameters given by the RBC also define whether the MA request shall be
repeated until a new MA is received or not and if so, the time between each repetition.

3.8.2.5      The given data shall be valid until new MA request parameters are given from the
RBC.

3.8.2.6      In case no MA request parameters are stored on-board and following an MA request
no MA has been received, the request shall be repeated with a repetition cycle
according to a fixed value (see appendix).

3.8.2.7      In level 2/3: an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the driver selects start.

3.8.2.7.1 In level 0, 1, NTC: if a level 2/3 transition is announced and a communication session
is already established, an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the information
"Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location" is received from balise group.

3.8.2.7.2 In level 0, 1, NTC: the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also inform the RBC
about the identity of the level 2/3 transition location balise group, as received through
the information "Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location".

3.8.2.7.3 In level 2/3: An MA request shall be sent to the RBC when any part of the track
description is deleted according to A.3.4, except for situations a, b, f, k.

3.8.2.8     Together with the MA request the on-board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s)
why the MA request is sent:

a) Start selection by driver,
b) Time before reaching perturbation location reached,

)
c) Time before a section timer or the LOA speed timer expires reached,
d) The track description has been deleted,

e) Track ahead free up to level 2/3 transition location.

3.8.3       Structure of a Movement Authority (MA)

3.8.3.1      The distance to the End of Movement Authority can be composed of several sections.
3.8.3.2      For each section composing the MA the following information shall be given;
a) Length of the section

b) Optionally, Section time-out value and distance from beginning of section to Section
timer stop location

3.8.3.3.1 Note: If only one section is given in the MA it is regarded as the End Section.
3.8.3.4     The Section timer stop location shall be inside of the corresponding section.

3.8.3.4.1 Note: the End Section and Overlap timer start locations may be outside their
corresponding section. One example can be seen referring to figure 22c: An infill MA
towards a signal at stop will replace the previous End Section by a new short End
Section starting at the infill location reference and ending at the next main signal,
however the End Section and Overlap timer start locations still have to be consistent
with the Interlocking timer start locations. Another example is when a timer start
location is in rear of the LRBG.

3.8.3.5     In level 3, no time-outs shall be used.

3.8.3.5.1 Note: For level 3 functionality the split of responsibility between the RBC and the
Interlocking has to be considered. Time-out of routes and related overlap can not be
based on train position reports since the position report can be delayed compared to

the real position of the train. The route release and revocation of routes can not be
carried out by the interlocking until permitted by the RBC.

When an MA is transmitted by a balise group, the length of the first section shall refer
to the balise co-ordinate system of that balise group.

In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance
from the balise group at the main signal to the location of the main signal, i.e. the
distance to EOA is given. Where available, information concerning danger point and
overlap for this EOA may also be given.

Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the
signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise
group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to
the train.

Note: In case the main signal is at danger in level 1, the on-board will supervise the
given distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7) as the distance to EOA.

When an MA is transmitted by radio from the RBC, the length of the first section shall
refer to the balise co-ordinate system of the LRBG given in the same message.

It shall be possible to give the length of a section to any location in the track.

Note: A section can cover several blocks and is not restricted to block ends (see
figures).

3.8.4.1       End Section Time-Out

3.8.4.1.1 The End Section timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the End
Section timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.

3.8.4.1.2 When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:

a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train. Refer to
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board,
which shall be deleted accordingly;

b) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set
to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn
to the current position of the train).

3.8.4.1.3 In case no End Section timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an
End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater than its time-out
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2.

3.8.4.1.3.1   Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location,
therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption
is to consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End
Section will soon be released by the Interlocking.

3.8.4.1.4 In case an End Section timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train,
the on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time-out value
with the value received with the new MA.

3.8.4.1.4.1   Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of
current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer.

3.8.4.2      Section Time-Outs

3.8.4.2.1 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section:
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise
group giving the MA.

3.8.4.2.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.

3.8.4.2.2 When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:

a) the EOA/LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked
section. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly;

b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply ;

c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set
to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn
to the entry point of the revoked section).

speed time out)

3.8.4.3.1 The on-board shall start a timer for the LOA speed:

b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise
group giving the MA.

3.8.4.3.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.

3.8.4.3.2 When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the speed associated with the LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of
Authority becomes an End of Authority and the SvL is defined on-board according to
3.8.4.5). Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.8.4.4      Time-out of Overlap

3.8.4.4.1 The Overlap timer shall be started on-board when the train passes the Overlap timer
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end. The timer shall be
considered as started even if a time-out value “infinite” is given.

3.8.4.4.2 When the Overlap timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the following shall apply:

a) the overlap information shall be deleted and the Supervised Location shall be
determined in accordance with 3.8.4.5. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive
list of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted
accordingly.

b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted

c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set
to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA).

3.8.4.4.3 If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.

3.8.4.4.4 In case no Overlap timer is running when the on-board receives a new MA with an
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2.

3.8.4.4.4.1   Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location,
therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption
is to consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the
Overlap will soon be released by the Interlocking.

the value received with the new MA.

Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of
current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer.

Supervised Location

The Supervised Location (SvL) shall be defined on-board as:
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out).

b) if not, the Danger Point (if any).

C) if not, the End Of Authority.

As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board.
Infill MA (level 1 only)
An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA.

An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the on-board equipment is in FS or LS
mode.

The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main
signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in
advance by the infill device.

An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the linking information, regarding the
main signal balise group to which it refers, is available.

The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal:

a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the
first encountered balise of the infill balise group.

b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop
message.

c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA.

MA Update

A new MA shall replace a previously received MA in the following ways:

a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced
by the new data.

b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced balise
group at the next main signal shall be replaced.

Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1 and
the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6).

When an infill MA is received, the on-board shall start a new MA section at the infill
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1).

If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former
MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on-board,
which shall be deleted accordingly.

If a new MA defines an SvL while the on-board was supervising an LOA, this shall
always be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of
the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based
information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

It shall be possible to update the length of an MA section by means of repositioning
information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3).

Note: The concerned MA section need not be the end section.

Upon reception of repositioning information and only if linking information has
announced a following balise group as unknown but containing repositioning
information, the on-board shall update the length of the current MA section in which the
train front end is.

A balise group message containing a movement authority shall not contain
repositioning information for the same direction.

Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA.

The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be
considered as an MA shortening by the on-board equipment.

Examples of MA update

Note: In the following examples on how to update an MA are given. The examples are
not exhaustive.
Example: Extension of MA via a main balise group in Level 1

a) The RBC proposes a new MA with an EOA closer to the train than the current
EOA/LOA, optionally with a mode profile.

b) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check the train front end position
versus the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA.

e Ifitis in rear, the on-board equipment shall accept the new MA.

e If it is in advance, the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA
remains valid

c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision.

3.8.6.2     If the request from the RBC is granted by the on-board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the
exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.9      Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only)

3.9.1          General

3.9.1.1      It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on-board equipment using
a) Balise groups
b) Euroloops

c) Radio infill units.

3.9.1.1.1 If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes infill
information, those devices are also identified as infill devices.

3.9.1.2   The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of
transmission media.

3.9.1.3     If the on-board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested
by the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by
the on-board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously
received information.

3.9.1.4     Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already
covered in previous chapters).

3.9.2        Infill by loop

3.9.2.1     An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the
end of a loop. When receiving this information, the on-board equipment knows that it is
entering/leaving a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it is
possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop.

3.9.2.2     Balise groups shall be used as EOLMs. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM
information to the passing train.

3.9.2.3      EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The general
rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

--- Page 98 ---
ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

3.9.2.4      EOLM information might be contained in a balise group that contains other information.
3.9.2.5      The EOLM shall send the identity of the announced loop.

3.9.2.6     The on-board shall only accept information coming from the loop with the announced
identity.

3.9.2.7        Deleted.
3.9.2.8        Deleted.

3.9.2.9   The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for
reception of the loop information:

e Loop identity used to identify the loop.
e Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop telegrams.

e Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where
on loop messages can be received.

e Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be
received.

e Indicator telling the on-board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or
reverse to the orientation of the announcing EOLM.

3.9.2.10 The on-board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing
the EOLM.

3.9.2.11 When the on-board equipment reads the next main signal balise group or when it
detects that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information
possibly received from the loop shall be ignored.

3.9.2.12 The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for
diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop
telegrams to specific locations.

3.9.3       Infill by radio

3.9.3.1      In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on-board equipment orders to
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.

3.9.3.2      The orders shall be sent via balise groups or via Radio Infill units.

3.9.3.3      The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored:
a) Intentionally deleted.

b) If the on-board equipment does not include radio.

3.9.3.4   If the on-board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be
established using the same protocols and interfaces as for Level 2/3 operations.

3.9.3.5     If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via balise
groups is received, the on-board equipment shall, once the location indicated in the
order is reached:

a) terminate any existing communication session(s) with RIU(s) not indicated in the
order

b) as soon as a new communication session can be handled, establish a
communication session with the RIU indicated in the order
3.9.3.5.1 Intentionally deleted.
3.9.3.5.1.1      Intentionally deleted.
3.9.3.5.2 Intentionally deleted.

3.9.3.6     If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via Radio
Infill unit is received, the on-board equipment shall:

a) If only one RIU communication session is ongoing, maintain the existing
communication session and establish a new one with the RIU indicated in the order.

b) If two RIU communication sessions are ongoing, maintain the communication
session related to the current infill area, terminate the other one and establish a new
one with the RIU indicated in the order.

3.9.3.6.1 Exception (degraded situation): if the on-board can handle only one communication
session, the order shall be ignored.

3.9.3.7   A Radio Infill Unit shall not initiate a communication session with an on-board
equipment.

3.9.3.8     The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall
be sent together with the following radio infill area information:

a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the
order).Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location
marks the beginning of the Radio Infill Area.

b) Next main signal balise group identifier (ignored by the on-board if the action is
Terminate communication session).Note: the reference location of this balise group
marks the end of the Radio Infill Area.

3.9.3.8.1 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units
(see 3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information.

3.9.3.9    The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the
operational level of the on-board i.e. the information in the balise group shall be taken
into account as usual in level 1.

data, not their acknowledgement or their revocation.

Justification: In case of hazardous events, it is possible to use high priority data in the
radio connection between RBC and on-board equipment to get a quick reaction.

An emergency message shall contain an identifier decided by the trackside.
The same identifier shall be used in case the emergency message is repeated.

If the on-board receives a new message with the same identifier it shall replace the
previous one.

Each emergency message to an on-board equipment shall be acknowledged, using
the corresponding emergency message identification number.

message by on-board equipment and is independent from the general
acknowledgement for track-to-train messages, as specified in section 3.16.3.5.

Emergency Stop

It shall be possible to stop a train with a conditional or an unconditional emergency
stop message.

A conditional emergency stop message shall contain the information of a new stop
location, referred to the LRBG. In case, when receiving this message

e the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the
emergency stop message shall be rejected and the RBC shall be informed.

e the train has not yet passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the
emergency stop message shall be accepted, however this location shall be used by
the onboard to define a new EOA/SvL only if not beyond the current EOA/LOA.
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored
on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

When receiving an unconditional emergency stop message the train shall be tripped
immediately.

New movement authority received after any accepted emergency stop message and
before the emergency message has been revoked, shall be rejected.

Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients

Introduction

The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions.

A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS
level.

Definition of Static Speed Restriction

Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment.

There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP)

b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP)

c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR)

d) Maximum Train Speed

e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1)

f) Mode related Speed Restriction.

g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Subset-035)

h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset-035)
i) Level Crossing speed restriction (LX SR)

j) Override function related Speed Restriction

k) Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted braking distance (PBD SR) (see
3.11.11)

The Static Speed Restriction categories are independent of each other. This means
that one speed restriction category cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other
category of Static Speed Restrictions.

3.11.3 Static Speed Profile (SSP)

3.11.3.1.1 The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed,
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges.

3.11.3.1.2 The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent.
The relationship between track and train characteristics determines the individual
Static Speed Profile for each train.

3.11.3.1.3 It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit
specified for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element.

3.11.3.2 Static Speed Profile Categories

3.11.3.2.1 It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories.

3.11.3.2.1.1 The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:

a) The “Cant Deficiency’ SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category.

b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories
corresponding to the other international train categories

3.11.3.2.1.2 Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the
following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of
specific SSP categories.

3.11.3.2.2 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall:

a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default “Cant
Deficiency” SSP

b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs

c) specify, for each “other specific’ SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Cant
Deficiency” SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment according to
3.11.3.2.3

3.11.3.2.3 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
select the SSP best suiting its “Cant Deficiency” train category, according to the
following order of preference:

a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matching its “Cant Deficiency” train category,
OR

b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency’ SSP with the highest Cant Deficiency value below
the value of its “Cant Deficiency” train category, OR

c) the Basic SSP

train belonging to at least one or more “other international” train categories shall use
the most restrictive speed amongst:

a) the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other

3.11.3.3.1 A maximum of 31 train categories is defined to match the SSP categories. 16 “Cant
Deficiency” train categories and 15 “other international” train categories.

3.11.3.3.2 A train shall always belong to one and only one “Cant Deficiency” train category and
may optionally belong to one or more “other international” train categories.

3.11.3.3.3 The train category(ies) to which a train belongs is a part of its Train Data.

3.11.4 Axle load Speed Profile

3.11.4.1 It shall be possible to define an Axle load Speed Profile as a non-continuous profile.

3.11.4.2 | For each section with a speed restriction due to axle load, the different speed value(s)
and for which minimum axle load category this speed value(s) applies shall be
specified.

3.11.4.2.1 Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category can be
applicable to the same distance.

3.11.4.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider the most restrictive speed
restriction that is associated with any axle load category lower than, or equal to that of
the train.

3.11.4.4 ”For trains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given
in the profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not consider any speed
restriction due to axle load.

3.11.4.5 “The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be “no restriction due to axle load”.

3.11.4.6 Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with
train length, shall be determined by the axle load speed profile information sent to the
on-board equipment.

3.11.5      Temporary Speed Restrictions

3.11.5.1 The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of
track infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc.

3.11.5.2 All Temporary Speed Restrictions are independent of each other. This means that an
individual Temporary Speed Restriction cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other
individual Temporary Speed Restriction.

3.11.5.3 Whether a speed increase after the temporary speed restriction shall be delayed with
train length, shall be determined by the temporary speed restriction information sent to
the on-board equipment.

3.11.5.4 When two or more temporary speed restrictions overlap, the most restrictive speed of
the overlapping temporary speed restrictions shall be used in the area of overlap.

3.11.5.6 It shall be possible to identify whether a Temporary Speed Restriction is possible to
revoke or not.

3.11.5.7 Anew Temporary Speed Restriction shall not replace a previously received Temporary
Speed Restriction with another identity.

3.11.5.8 | Temporary Speed Restrictions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.

3.11.5.9 — If the on-board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the
same identity as an already received TSR, the new Temporary Speed Restriction shall
replace the previous one, except when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified
as non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR.

3.11.5.13 When ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has accepted an order to reject revocable
TSRs from balises, this inhibition shall be stored and shall be effective immediately,

3.11.5.14 The inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises shall be deleted if any of the following
occurs:
e the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is
terminated, OR

e incase of RBC/RBC handover, the train front end crosses the RBC/RBC border.
3.11.5.15 Note: this inhibition may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling applications

balises. The RBC may then order inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises and
instead send more precise TSRs to the train.

corresponding national value or the corresponding default values if the national values
are not applicable.

3.11.7.1.1 Exception 1: For the modes On-sight, Limited Supervision and Shunting the speed

Override function related Speed Restriction

While the “override” function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value)
shall be taken into account.

Speed restriction to ensure permitted braking distance

It shall be possible for trackside to request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to
calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance given by trackside.

The order shall be given by means of a non-continuous profile defining:
e The start and end location for the speed restriction
e The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculate the speed restriction value

e Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or
Emergency Brake

e Asingle gradient value applicable for the calculation

The speed restriction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be re-
calculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed
restriction changes.

The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
take into account that:

e The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value
according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3.

e The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but without considering
the adhesion profiles, the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track
conditions related to powerless section given by trackside.

e The expected deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without
considering the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions
related to powerless section given by trackside.

e The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake
Deceleration (EBD) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches zero
speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.

e If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also calculate a Service Brake
Deceleration (SBD) curve based on the expected deceleration and that reaches
zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance.

e The estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”.

permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake;
V_deltaOPBD = f4:(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD)) if the permitted braking distance is
to be achieved with the service brake.

e The train will travel a distance from the last encountered balise of a group that
provides restrictive information until initiating the brake command. This travelled
distance shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed considering a
processing delay (T41) equal to SUBSET-041 § 5.2.1.1.

e Regardless of how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see
3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the service
brake feedback was not implemented.

e Regardless of how the traction cut-off interface is actually configured (see
3.13.2.2.8), T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut-off was
not implemented.

Note: Knowing how the PBD speed restriction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the appropriate
permitted braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the brake command
in due time when encountering a further balise group providing restrictive information.
In other words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisions based on
the characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information e.g. distances
between balises in that group with regards to validity direction of transmitted
information and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location.

Note: If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, it is the
responsibility of the trackside to also consider an estimation of the on-board over-
reading and under-reading amounts at the time the brake command is initiated in order
to lower the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI
supervision limit.

Note: Throughout the following formulas, all the distances marked with “d” (lower case)
are counted from a single arbitrary reference location.

If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall seek the PBD speed restriction value
(V_PBD) which satisfies the two following inequalities. The resulting value shall then
be rounded down to the next lower multiple of 5km/h:

ERTMS/ETCS external function”), with the exception of big metal mass track
condition, sound horn track condition, non stopping area, tunnel stopping area and
supervision of radio transmission which are handled inside the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment.

Note: Whether some information shall be filtered (not shown to the driver or not sent to
an ERTMS/ETCS external function) is outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.

Note: The ERTMS/ETCS external function must be able to handle new track condition
of the same type as previously received and covering the same distance.

The train is permitted to run without any track condition information given from the
trackside. The initial state shall then be used by the on-board equipment.

Route Suitability

Route suitability data defines which values concerning loading gauge, traction system
and axle load category a train must meet to be allowed to enter the route.

It shall be possible for trackside to send route suitability data as location data when
needed.

On reception of route suitability data, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall

compare it with the corresponding Train Data stored on-board. Unsuitability exists if:

a) The loading gauge profile of the train is not included in the list of loading gauges
accepted by trackside

b) The list of traction systems accepted by the engine does not include the one

Mode profile
It shall be possible for trackside to send a Mode Profile. The Mode Profile can request
On Sight mode, Limited Supervision mode and Shunting mode.

For OS and LS mode the mode profile defines the entry and the length of the On
Sight/Limited Supervision area. For SH mode the mode profile only defines the entry
location to SH mode, any length given shall be ignored by the on-board.

On reception of a new MA (with or without Mode Profile) the on-board equipment shall
delete the currently supervised Mode Profile.

Exception: When receiving a new MA by infill, any currently supervised Mode Profile
shall be deleted only beyond the reference location of the infill information.

In case the mode profile information for shunting is overwritten by a new shunting
profile, before the on-board equipment switches to SH mode, a previous list of balise
groups for SH area shall be deleted or replaced by a new list of balise groups for SH
area.

The beginning of the Mode Profile relates to the max safe front end of the train.

The end of the mode profile relates to the min safe front end of the train.

Level Crossings

It shall be possible for trackside to inform the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
about the conditions under which a Level Crossing (LX) must be passed.

Each Level Crossing shall have an identity, so that all LX information is independent of
each other. This means that an individual LX information cannot affect, nor be affected
by, any other individual LX information.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a new LX information with the same
identity as an already received LX information, the new LX information shall replace
the previous one.

Level Crossing information shall be given as profile data, corresponding to the LX start
location and the length of the LX area.

Level Crossing information shall indicate whether the LX is protected or not.

In case the LX is not protected, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be informed:
a) at which speed the LX is allowed to be passed

3.13      Speed and distance monitoring

3.13.1     Introduction

3.13.1.1 The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus
its position, in order to assure that the train remains within the given speed and
distance limits.

3.13.1.1.1 Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on-board can only assure this when
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled:
e Brake system of the train functions as specified
e wheelrail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration
e Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs) are correctly entered into the

on-board

3.13.1.2 | Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes
them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released.
However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake
command is an implementation issue.

3.13.1.3 Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements contributing to the speed and
distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the
following chapters.

3.13.2.1 Introduction

Inputs for speed and distance monitoring

3.13.2.1.1 The traction / braking models, the brake position / brake percentage are used for the
definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a service brake command or an
emergency brake command has been initiated.

3.13.2.1.2 However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore
incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring.

3.13.2.1.3 The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are
required for reference conditions set by trackside.

3.13.2.2 Train related inputs
3.13.2.2.1 Introduction

3.13.2.2.1.1 The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are:
a) Traction model

b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake
percentage

c) Brake position

d) Special brakes (interface configuration and status)

e) Service brake (interface configuration and application)
f) Traction cut-off interface

g) On-board correction factors

h) Nominal rotating mass

i) Train length

j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring

k) Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed)

3.13.2.2.1.2 These train related inputs are acquired as Train Data (see 3.18.3.2 items b) c) and
d)), except:

e the configuration of the special brakes, service brake and traction cut-off interfaces
which are not affected by the Train Data acquisition,

e the service brake application and the special brakes statuses which are
continuously acquired on the Train Interface,

e the fixed values.

3.13.2.2.1.3 The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train
Data, unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model
is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits).

3.13.2.2.2 Traction model

3.13.2.2.2.1 The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. It
shall describe the time delay T_traction_cut_off from the traction cut-off command by

SUBSET-026-3                                                System Requirements Specification                           Page 89/204

the on-board (t0) to the moment the acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is
guaranteed to be zero (t1). The estimated acceleration value of the train shall be
considered during this time delay.

3.13.2.2.2.2 Note: The current value of A_traction is not known directly by the on-board. It is
implicitly known as a contribution to the estimated acceleration, together with the
acceleration due to gradient.

3.13.2.2.3 Braking Models

3.13.2.2.3.1. Speed Dependent Deceleration
3.13.2.2.3.1.1 The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed.

3.13.2.2.3.1.2 It shall be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent
deceleration model.

3.13.2.2.3.1.3 Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as
follows:
e A_brake = AD_O when 0 § speed s V1
e A_brake = AD_1 when V1 < speed s V2
e A_brake = AD_2 when V2 < speed s V3
e A_brake = AD_3 when V3 < speed

Figure 30: Speed Dependent Deceleration Model

3.13.2.2.3.1.4 The last step of A_brake(V) shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it
has no upper speed limit.

3.13.2.2.3.1.5 The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full
in Figure 31)

3.13.2.2.3.1.6 The model shall be used for the emergency brake nominal deceleration
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V))
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).

3.13.2.2.3.1.7 It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of
A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V) for each combination of use of
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake.

3.13.2.2.3.1.8 Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence
of a specific brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the
choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for
A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an
ETCS implementation issue.

3.13.2.2.3.1.9 It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of
A_brake_normal_service(V):

a) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G”

b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight
train in P”

3.13.2.2.3.1.10 A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full
service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0):

If A_brake_service(V = 0) < A_SBO1

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)
if A_LSBO1 < A_brake_service(V = 0) < A_SB12

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_1(V)
if A_SB12 < A_brake_service (V = 0)

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V)

3.13.2.2.3.1.11 Note: the two pivot values A SB01 and A_SB12 are part of the
A_brake_normal_service model, i.e. they are train related input data for the speed and
distance monitoring function.

3.13.2.2.3.2.1 The deceleration A_brake is not available immediately after the on-board
commands the brake. There is a time lag between brake command and the start of the
brake force build-up. There is also time needed to build up the full brake force.

3.13.2.2.3.2.2 The model for the brake build up time shall be given as a step function as explained
in Figure 31.

Figure 31: Brake Build Up Time Model

3.13.2.2.3.2.3 In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined:

a) T_brake_react (t0...t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on-
board and the moment the brake force starts to build up.

b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the
zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached.

c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time.

3.13.2.2.3.2.4 The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase.

3.13.2.2.3.2.5 This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service).

3.13.2.2.3.2.6 Note: The equivalent brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning
of the build-up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is
compensated by a higher deceleration.

3.13.2.2.3.2.7 Note: T_brake_react and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for
completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the
speed and distance monitoring function.

3.13.2.2.3.2.8 It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency and
T_brake_service for each combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current
brake, magnetic shoe brake and Ep brake.

3.13.2.2.3.2.9 Note: Individual values of T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service may be equal,
thereby avoiding the influence of a specific brake. However, the choice to take into
account or not the contribution of a specific brake for T_brake_emergency and
T_brake_service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue.

3.13.2.2.3.2.10 Note: In general, T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service are determined by
the pneumatic brake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the
Electro-pneumatic brake system is used, it is possible that T_brake_emergency and
T_brake_service are determined by another special brake.

3.13.2.2.4 Brake Position
3.13.2.2.4.1 The brake position shall be set to one of the following three values:
a) Passenger train in P
b) Freight train in P
c) Freight train in G
3.13.2.2.4.2 Note: The brake position defines the behaviour of the brake for specific train types.
3.13.2.2.5 Brake Percentage

3.13.2.2.5.1 If the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is
applicable (see 3.13.3.2), they are used to derive A_brake_emergency(V),
A_brake_service(V), T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service.

3.13.2.2.5.2 Note: the conversion model has been designed assuming that all the provisions laid
down in the UIC leaflet 544-1 6" edition, with the exception of sections 9.1.2, 9.2.2 and
9.3.3, apply for the acquired brake percentage.

3.13.2.2.6.3 When the brake percentage is captured as Train Data and the conversion model is
applicable, A_brake_emergency(V), T_brake_emergency and A_brake_service(V)
shall not be influenced by the status of a special brake. However, the conversion
model offers the possibility that T_brake_service can be affected by the status of the
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or Ep brake (see A.3.9).

3.13.2.2.6.4 The on-board equipment shall be configured to define whether it is allowed to take
into account the contribution of a special/additional brake, which is independent from
wheel/rail adhesion, for the selection of the maximum emergency brake deceleration
under reduced adhesion conditions (see 3.13.6.2.1.6).

3.13.2.2.6.5 Note: the choice to set to “allowed” the contribution of such special/additional brake
in the selection of the maximum emergency braking effort, is rolling stock dependent.

3.13.2.2.6.6 If it is allowed to take into account the contribution of a special/additional brake,
which is independent from wheel/rail adhesion, the speed and distance monitoring
function shall take into account the status “active” or “not active” of the
special/additional brake to select the appropriate National Value under reduced
adhesion conditions (see 3.13.2.3.7.7).

3.13.2.2.7 Service brake

3.13.2.2.7.1 The on-board shall be configured to define whether the service brake command is
implemented or not, i.e. whether a service brake interface is implemented to command
a full service brake effort.

3.13.2.2.7.2 The on-board shall be configured to define whether the service brake feedback is
implemented or not, i.e. whether it is able to acquire from the service brake interface
the information that the service brake is currently applied.

3.13.2.2.7.3 lf the service brake feedback is implemented and if not inhibited by National Value,
the speed and distance monitoring function shall take into account either the main
brake pipe pressure or the brake cylinder pressure to adjust in real time the expected
brake build up time (see 3.13.9.3.3.4 and Appendix A.3.10).

3.13.2.2.8 Traction cut-off interface

3.13.2.2.8.1_ The on-board shall be configured to define whether the traction cut-off command is
implemented, i.e. whether the interface to the traction system is implemented or not.

3.13.2.2.9 On-board Correction Factors

3.13.2.2.9.1 Correction factors for the emergency deceleration

3.13.2.2.9.1.1 If the braking models are captured as Train Data, rolling stock correction factors
shall be defined in the ETCS on-board equipment. If the brake percentage is captured

as Train Data and the conversion model is used (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits), no
rolling stock correction factor shall apply.

3.13.2.2.9.1.2 For each defined individual speed dependent deceleration model of
A_brake_emergency(V) (i.e. corresponding to each combination of use of regenerative
brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake), one set of rolling stock
correction factors Kdry_rst(V, EBCL) and Kwet_rst(V) shall be defined in the on-board
equipment.

3.13.2.2.9.1.3 For a given confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration (EBCL), the
rolling stock correction factor Kdry_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of speed,
with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V).

3.13.2.2.9.1.4 The confidence level on emergency brake safe deceleration represents the
probability of the following individual event: the rolling stock emergency brake
subsystem of the train does ensure a deceleration at least equal to
A_brake_emergency(V) * Kdry_rst(V), when the emergency brake is commanded on
dry rails.

3.13.2.2.9.1.5 The rolling stock correction factor Kwet_rst(V) shall be given as a step function of
speed, with the same steps as the ones of A_brake_emergency(V). It represents the
loss of deceleration with regards to emergency braking on dry rails, when the
emergency brake is commanded on wet rails, according to wheel/rail adhesion
reference conditions.

Conversion Models

Introduction

For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre-
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models
are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake
percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.

Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS
specifications.

Applicability of the conversion models

The conversion models shall be used by the on-board equipment if the brake
percentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the
brake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the
conversion models:

a) 0< Vs 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h
b) 30 <A < 250, where A is the brake percentage in %

c) 0<L<sLmax, where L is the train length in m and where Lmax = 900 m if the brake
position is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500 m if the brake position is “Freight
train in P” or “Freight train in G”

3.13.3.2.1.1 Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model.

3.13.3.2.2 For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable,
which means that braking models (i.e. pre-programmed deceleration profiles and
brake build up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function.

The default gradient for TSR shall be compensated in value according to the rotating
mass as defined in 3.13.4.3.

For all locations not covered by the gradient profile, the on-board shall consider the
gradient value as:

a) the default gradient for TSR, if available and if the concerned target is due to a TSR

b) zero, for other cases.
Train length compensation

Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any location between the current
(actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35).

Rotating mass

The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see
Figure 35).

Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating
mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy
added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion.
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same
train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear
forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for
the train without rotating mass.

3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it

3.13.4.3.2

is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.
The following formulas shall be used:

a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:

e Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)

e Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)

b) If M_rotating_nom is known:

e Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)

e Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)
Legend:
A_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient

Determination of locations without special brake contribution and with
reduced adhesion conditions

As long as it uses a track condition profile given by trackside, the on-board shall
consider locations without special brake contribution over a distance going from the
start location of the profile to the foot of the deceleration curve (EBD, SBD or GUI, see
sections 3.13.8.3, 3.13.8.4 and 3.13.8.5).

If the status of a special brake is “not active”, all locations shall be considered without
the contribution of this special brake.

Note: in such case, a track condition profile implying the inhibition of this special brake
will have no effect.

From the adhesion profile given by trackside, the on-board shall consider locations with
reduced adhesion conditions over a distance going from the start location of the profile
to the location derived by adding the train length to the end location of the profile.

When slippery rail is selected by the driver, all locations shall be considered with
reduced adhesion conditions.

The speed and distance monitoring shall use, as resulting reduced adhesion
conditions, the most restrictive value of the adhesion conditions selected by the driver
and the adhesion conditions calculated from the trackside profile.

values (see Figure 38).

3.13.8.2 Determination of the supervised targets

3.13.8.2.1 The on-board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the
following types of target:

a) the locations corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP (if any), which are in
advance of the max safe front end of the train

b) the Limit of Authority (LOA)
c) the End of Authority (EQOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL)

d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff
Responsible, with a target speed zero

3.13.8.2.1.1 Note: depending on the information received from trackside and the position of the
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty.

3.13.8.2.2 The list of supervised targets shall be re-evaluated when any of the elements it is built
of is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on-board, EOA and/or
SvL temporarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored
information in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)).

3.13.8.2.3 A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the
list of supervised targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the
target location.

3.13.8.3 Emergency Brake Deceleration curves (EBD)

3.13.8.3.1 If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on-board shall calculate an EBD
curve based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d), that crosses the ceiling speed EBI
supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2) at the target location, and that extends up to the
location where the target speed is reached (EBD foot).

3.13.8.5.1 The purpose of the guidance curve (GUI) is to provide a comfortable way of braking for
the driver, to avoid excessive wear of the brakes and to save traction energy.

3.13.8.5.2 If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on-board shall calculate a guidance
curve (GUI) for each supervised target, based on the normal service brake
deceleration A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where
the GUI speed is equal to the target speed) shall be:

a) the target location, in case of EOA/SvL

b) the location defined in 3.13.9.3.5.9, for others targets

3.13.9.3 Braking to target supervision limits

3.13.9.3.1 Overview

3.13.9.3.1.1 The braking to target supervision limits are derived from the EBD, SBD and GUI
curves.

3.13.9.3.1.2 From an EBD curve, the Emergency brake intervention (EBI), Service brake
intervention (SBI2), Warning (W), Permitted speed (P) and Indication (I) supervision
limits, valid for the estimated speed, are defined as follows(see Figure 45):

3.13.9.3.1.4 No specific supervision limit is calculated from the GUI curve: it is only used to
adjust the Permitted speed (P) supervision limit, which is obtained either from the EBD
or the SBD curve.

compensate the inaccuracy of the speed measurement by taking into account the

speed under reading amount (V_ura) at the moment when the calculation is made:
V_deltaO = V_ura (see Figure 45).

3.13.9.3.2.2 The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application
of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts:

a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem
3.13.9.3.2.3 The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows:
a) when the traction cut-off is implemented:
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0).
b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off

3.13.9.3.2.4 Note: When the traction cut-off is implemented, the traction cut-off command is
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the
equation above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from
the EBD.

3.13.9.3.2.5 T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.4.

3.13.9.3.2.6 The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MAX(T_be -
T_traction ; 0).

3.13.9.3.2.7 Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless
included to make the specifications complete.

3.13.9.3.2.8 During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one measured at
the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values.

3.13.9.3.2.9 If T_be > T_traction, the estimated acceleration during T_berem (A_est2) shall be
the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values
between 0 and +0.4m/s?.

3.13.9.3.2.10 The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed
between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application of the braking effort
is reached shall be derived as follows (see Figure 45):

3.13.9.3.3.3 If the service brake command is available for use and the service brake feedback is
not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs.

3.13.9.3.3.4 If both the service brake command and the service brake feedback are available for
use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall by default be set to T_bs. When the service brake is used
by the driver in target speed monitoring or release speed monitoring, they shall be
reduced and possibly locked to the respective fixed values of 0s and T_bs2_locked,
until the ceiling speed monitoring is entered; they are then reset to T_bs (refer to
detailed algorithm in Appendix A.3.10).

3.13.9.3.3.4.1 In case T_bs < T_bs2_locked then T_bs2 shall be equal to T_bs2_locked.

3.13.9.3.3.5 If the service brake command is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be set
to zero.

3.13.9.3.3.6 Note: The values T_bs1 and T_bs2 = Os are defined to achieve the maximum
performance when service brake command is not used.

3.13.9.3.5.9 In order to determine the reference location of the target distance displayed to the
driver, in order to check whether the target is masking another one, and in order to
determine the foot of the GUI curve (only if it is enabled) in case of target different from
EOA/SvL, the location of the Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the target
speed, shall be calculated from the EBD, taking into account the following
assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”

b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the target speed, as defined in
SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: V_deltaOt = f41(V_target)

3.13.9.3.5.10 To do so, the same formulas defined above with V_est and V_delta0 shall be
applied, by substituting V_est with V_target and V_deltaO with V_delta0t.

3.13.9.3.5.10.1 Justification: these assumptions are intended to avoid fluctuations of the target
distance displayed to the driver. Moreover the foot of the GUI curve may influence the
perturbation location, which must be fully predictable for trackside engineering
reasons.

Permitted speed supervision limit, valid for the LX speed shall be used in order to
determine the location where the supervision of the LX start location is substituted by
the supervision of the LX speed (see section 5.16.3).

3.13.9.3.5.12 To calculate this location, the same formulas defined above with V_est shall be
applied by substituting V_est with V_LX.

3.13.9.3.6.2 If the service brake feedback interface is not available for use, then T_indication
shall be calculated as follows:

Tirdication = max {(0.8 . Ts ),Ss}+ Tiriver

3.13.9.3.6.3 Note: The reduction of T_indication by a factor is intended to improve performance
and the feasibility of this reduction is based on experience with real implementations.
To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication,
giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake.

3.13.9.3.6.4 If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication shall be
equal to 5s + T_driver.

3.13.9.4 Release speed supervision limits

3.13.9.4.1 The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA.
The EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, |
supervision limit associated to the release speed.

3.13.9.4.2 Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance.
The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the
balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the
EOA to the Supervised Location.

3.13.9.4.3 With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to:
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR

c) Instruct the on-board to use the national value.

3.13.9.4.4 In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release
speed shall be supervised.

3.13.9.4.5 Note: When the release speed is given as a fixed value from trackside, the
ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopping the train in rear of the
Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure
manager to set the appropriate release speed with regard to the risk of passing the
Supervised Location.

3.13.9.4.6 The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed
value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SBI supervision limit among the SBI1
related to EOA, the SBI2 related to SvL and, when the Release Speed is calculated
on-board, the SBI2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), if any, between the

3.13.9.4.8.2.1 Note: The above formulas are intended to prevent the calculated release speed
from fluctuating, according to the distance, speed and acceleration measurements. It
allows calculating the release speed only once, for a given on-board reference
location, unless
e the distance confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based on
the assumption that the whole distance between the current on-board
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET-041
odometer performance values and without any update of the on-board
reference location, or
e the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET-041
performance value
Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), the release
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is
acceptable from an operational point of view.

3.13.10.1 Introduction

3.13.10.1.1 By comparing the train speed and position to the various supervision limits defined in
the previous section, the on-board equipment generates braking commands, traction
cut-off commands and relevant information to the driver. The information displayed to
the driver is selected according to the following supervision statuses of the speed and
distance monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status,
Warning status and Intervention status.

3.13.10.1.2 The following types of speed and distance monitoring are defined:
e Ceiling speed monitoring (CSM)
e Target speed monitoring (TSM)

3.13.10.1.3 Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run
without the need to brake to a target.

3.13.10.1.4 Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the
train brakes to a target.

3.13.10.1.5 Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to
the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA.

3.13.10.2 General requirements

3.13.10.2.1 The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the
speed monitoring. This shall be the estimated speed.

3.13.10.2.2Once a Train Interface command (traction cut-off, service brake or emergency brake)
is triggered, the on-board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is
met.

3.13.10.2.3 If there is no on-board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring),
whenever a service brake command is specified, the emergency brake command shall
be triggered instead.

3.13.10.2.4The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to
the requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the

emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In
such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI
supervision limit shall prevail.

3.13.10.2.5 The on-board shall revoke the Intervention status only when no brake command is
applied by the speed and distance monitoring function.

3.13.10.2.6In level 2/3: Train trip shall be initiated if the on-board equipment detects that the
minimum safe front end has passed the EOA/LOA location.

3.13.10.2.7In Level 1: Train Trip shall be initiated if the on-board equipment detects that the
minimum safe antenna position (calculated by subtracting distance between active
Eurobalise antenna and the front end of the train from the min safe front end position)
has passed the EOA/LOA location.

3.13.10.2.8In the following sections, the term V_MRSP (together with the derived ceiling
supervision limits) refers to the lowest MRSP element encountered between the min
safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.

3.13.10.3 Requirements for Ceiling speed monitoring
3.13.10.3.1 The on-board equipment shall display the Permitted speed ceiling supervision limit.

3.13.10.3.2When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on-board
equipment shall display the SBI speed ceiling supervision limit.

3.13.10.3.3The on-board shall compare the estimated speed with the ceiling supervision limits
defined in section 3.13.9.2 and shall trigger/revoke commands to the train interface
(service brake if implemented or emergency brake) and supervision statuses as
described in Table 5 and Table 6.

the case, the on-board shall immediately set the supervision status to the relevant
value, applying a transition from the Normal status according to Table 7.

3.13.10.3.6 The Indication status is not used in ceiling speed monitoring. However, in case the
ceiling speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to
Indication, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions
from the Indication status, as described in Table 7.

3.13.10.3.7In ceiling speed monitoring, only the ceiling supervision limits (described in section
3.13.9.2) are used to determine the commands to the Train Interface and the
supervision statuses displayed to the driver. However the braking to target supervision
limits and the release speed supervision limits (described in sections 3.13.9.3 and
3.13.9.4) are also used to determine the locations where the transition to target speed
monitoring and to release speed monitoring occur respectively.

3.13.10.3.8 The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the first Indication location that will
be reached by either the max safe or by the estimated train front end. To that effect,
the on-board shall compute the remaining distance to the first Indication location as
follows:

information.

3.13.10.3.9If A_MAXREDADH (see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests the target information as
supplementary DMI information, the on-board equipment shall display to the driver the
target information (target speed and distance to target) related to one target at a time:
the Most Relevant Displayed Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst
the supervised targets as the one whose remaining distance to its Indication
supervision limit (as specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1) is the shortest. The
indicated distance to the target shall be computed in the same way as for target speed
monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.7, 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.

3.13.10.3.9.1 Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no
EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not display any target information.

3.13.10.3.10    If ALMAXREDADH (see 3.13.6.2.1.6) requests a time to Indication as
supplementary DMI information, the on-board equipment shall compute the Time to
Indication (TTI) as the time to travel at the estimated speed the remaining distance to
the first Indication location (as specified in 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1). The on-
board equipment shall inform the driver as long as this time is shorter than a fixed
value (refer to A.3.1).

3.13.10.3.10.1 Exception: In case the list of supervised targets is empty or in case of LOA with no
EBD based target whose speed value is below or equal to the estimated speed, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not compute any time to Indication.

3.13.10.4 Requirements for Target speed monitoring

3.13.10.4.1 In target speed monitoring, both the ceiling supervision limits and the braking to target
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2 and 3.13.9.3, are used to determine
the commands to the Train Interface and the supervision statuses displayed to the
driver.

3.13.10.4.2 The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Relevant Displayed
Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be selected amongst the supervised targets whose
Indication supervision limit is exceeded (i.e. a condition to trigger a supervision status
with respect to these targets is met, see table 8 and table 9) and shall be determined
according to the following steps:
e Step 0: MRDTo = the target of which the braking to target Permitted speed
supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5), calculated for the current position of
the train, is the lowest one amongst the concerned targets:

e Step 1: the on-board equipment shall check whether the MRDT obtained from the

previous step (MRDTo) masks any other target(s) remaining in the list of concerned
targets, whose target speed is lower than MRDTo. A target is masked by MRDTh if
its Indication supervision limit is located in rear of the location of the MRDTo
Permitted speed supervision limit, both at the target speed of MRDTo. It shall be
identified using one of the following formulas, where both the Indication supervision
limit and the Permitted speed supervision limit are calculated using the same
formulas defined above and by substituting V_est with V_target_MRDTo:

If at least one target is masked by MRDTo, then the MRDT obtained from this step
(MRDT1) shall be the masked target with its Indication supervision limit the furthest
in rear of the location of the MRDTo Permitted speed supervision limit and the on-
board equipment shall go to the next step.

If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by
MRDTp or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of concerned
targets, then the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e.
MRDT)).

e Step n: the on-board shall apply step n-1, substituting MRDT,-2 with MRDTn and

checking the list of concerned targets excluding the targets which have been
preselected as MRDT in all the previous steps (i.e. from MRDTo to MRDT,.;
inclusive).

3.13.10.4.2.2 Note 2: when entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one
target that satisfies the conditions to be selected as MRDT. Afterwards (e.g. due to
train braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be
selected as MRDT, which however only means that the target previously selected
remains the MRDT (see clause 3.13.10.4.5).

3.13.10.4.2.3 Note 3: if MRDT,.; is a target at zero speed (e.g. EOA or SvL), then it is always
selected as MRDT, i.e. no other target can be selected as MRDT as per step n.

3.13.10.4.3The on-board equipment shall display the Permitted speed, according to following
formula:

With Target_1, ..., Target_n being all the targets from the list of supervised targets

3.13.10.4.4When the supervision status is Overspeed, Warning or Intervention, the on-board
equipment shall display the SBI speed, according to the following formula:

3.13.10.4.5 Once a target is the MRDT, it shall remain the MRDT until it is removed from the list of
supervised targets or until it is replaced as MRDT with another target which is selected
for the first time according to clause 3.13.10.4.2. The driver shall be informed upon any
change of MRDT.

3.13.10.4.6 If the MRDT is either the EOA or the SvL, the on-board equipment shall display the
release speed, if given by the trackside or calculated on-board.

3.13.10.4.7 If the MRDT is neither the EOA nor the SvL, the indicated distance to the target shall
be the distance between the maximum safe front end and the location of the Permitted
speed supervision limit calculated for the target speed (see section 3.13.9.3.5 for the
calculation of this location), but limited to zero after this location is passed.

3.13.10.4.8.1 As long as the displayed values are locked due to SB feedback (see Appendix
A.3.10 for details), the on-board equipment shall ensure that the displayed Permitted
speed, the displayed SBI speed (if any) and the distance to target never increase (e.g.
due to the reduction of T_bs1 and T_bs2 or e.g. due to relocation). In other terms if a
concerned displayed value (VP_DMI, VSBI_DMI or target distance) calculated as
above has a higher value than the previously displayed value, then the previous value
shall remain displayed until a further calculated value is lower than the displayed one.

3.13.10.4.9 The on-board shall consider the service brake command as available for use unless:
a) The service brake command is not implemented, OR
b) The national value inhibits its use.

3.13.10.4.10    The on-board equipment shall compare the estimated speed and train position
with the ceiling and braking to target supervision limits and shall trigger/revoke
commands to the train interface (traction cut-off if implemented, service brake if
available for use or emergency brake) and supervision statuses, by evaluating and
taking into account the conditions as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.10.1.

3.13.10.4.10.1 The conditions in Table 8 and Table 10 shall be evaluated for each target related to

supervision limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to trigger the brake
commands and the transitions between supervision statuses. It does not show what is
displayed to the driver: in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is
displayed (even if not supervised) for values lower than the release speed.

3.13.10.4.13     In case of target EOA/SvL without any supervised release speed, the Table 9
and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting V_release with the value 0.

3.13.10.4.13.1In case the target is the location at the end of the maximum permitted distance to
run in Staff Responsible, the Table 9 and Table 11 shall be applied, by substituting
V_release with the value 0, SvL with staff responsible end location and by ignoring any
formula related to EOA.

3.13.10.4.14     A Tl command shall be triggered if a corresponding triggering condition is met for
at least one target. On the other hand it shall be revoked only if a corresponding
revocation condition is met for each supervised target.

3.13.10.4.15   The on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the different
supervision statuses as described in Table 12 (see section 4.6.1 for details about the

any target. On the other hand a transition from Overspeed, Warning or Intervention
status to the Indication status shall be made only if a revocation condition specified for
the concerned transition is met for each supervised target.

3.13.10.4.16     When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the target
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t3 defined in Table 8
or Table 9 shall be checked for each target in order to determine whether the
Indication status applies. If it is not the case, the on-board shall immediately set the
supervision status to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Indication status
according to clause 3.13.10.4.15.

3.13.10.4.17     The Normal status is not used in target speed monitoring. However, in case the
target speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to
Normal, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions from
the Normal status, as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.15.

3.13.10.4.18     Note: Depending upon train speed/position it is possible that for some target(s)
none of the triggering conditions specified in table 8 and 9 is met. However the
conditions to enter the target speed monitoring are such (see condition [1] in table 16)
that the clauses 3.13.10.4.16 and 3.13.10.4.17 always allow determining a supervision
status.

speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.

3.13.10.5.3 The braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to the MRDT (i.e. EOA
or SvL), as calculated in target speed monitoring from the EBD or SBD, shall also be
displayed in the same way as for target speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.3 and
3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply.

3.13.10.5.4The on-board equipment shall compare the estimated speed with the release speed

supervision status shall be determined according to the requirements specified for the
newly entered speed and distance monitoring.

3.13.11 Perturbation location

3.13.11.1 The purpose of the perturbation location is to trigger the MA request to the RBC in
order to renew the Movement Authority in due time before the train would have to
brake to an EOA/SvL or LOA target.

3.13.11.2 For the SvL or the LOA, the on-board shall calculate the perturbation location as
follows.

3.13.11.3 Starting from the first element of the MRSP (i.e. from the start location of the on-board
stored track description), the on-board shall calculate the location of the Indication
supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the
following assumptions:

a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”

b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed
measurement shall be set to a value, calculated from the speed of the MRSP
element, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: V_deltaQind = fa1(V_MRSP-n)

c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have any effect: T_bstind
and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use,
otherwise they shall be set to “zero”. T_tractionind and T_beremind shall be defined
as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem by substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind

3.13.11.4 To calculate the EBI supervision limit, the same formulas defined above with V_est,
T_traction, T_berem and V_deltaO shall be applied, by substituting V_est with
V_MRSP-n, T_traction with T_tractionind, T_berem with T_beremind and V_deltaO
with V_deltaQind.

the location of the Indication supervision limit and the SBD shall be:

3.13.11.9 If, in exceptional situation (e.g. after a shortening of MA), the EBD, SBD or GUI speed
at the start location of the MRSP is lower than the speed of the first element of the
MRSP, the location to trigger the MA request to the RBC shall be considered as
already passed.

3.13.11.10 Note: For trackside engineering reasons, the assumptions for the calculation of the EBI
supervision limit are necessary to obtain a fully predictable perturbation location, i.e.
independent from the measured acceleration and speed confidence interval.

3.14      Brake Command Handling and Protection against Undesirable
Train Movement

3.14.1      Brake Command Handling

3.14.1.1 Note: Whenever the type of brake used is not specified explicitly in the text, it shall be
interpreted as not being important for technical interoperability and being a property of
the specific implementation.

3.14.1.2 In case only the application of (the non-vital) service brake has been commanded and
the service brake fails to be applied, the emergency brake command shall be given.

3.14.1.3 If the emergency brake command was triggered due to a trip condition (see chapter 4)
the emergency brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver
acknowledgement of the trip condition.

3.14.1.4 For handling of brake commands resulting from the speed and distance monitoring,
refer to section 3.13.10.

3.14.1.5 If the brake command was triggered due to roll away protection, reverse movement
protection or standstill supervision the brake command shall be released at standstill
and after driver acknowledgement.

3.14.1.6 If the brake command was triggered due to linking error, balise group message
inconsistency or RAMS related supervision error, the brake command shall be
released at standstill.

3.14.1.7 If the brake command was triggered due to supervision of the safe radio connection
(T_NVCONTACT) the brake command shall be released at standstill or if a new
consistent message has been received from the RBC.

3.14.1.7.1 lf the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed reversing distance related

3.15.1       RBC/RBC Handover

3.15.1.1 Introduction

3.15.1.1.1 The RBC/RBC Handover principles are such that trains are able to pass from one RBC
area to another automatically (without driver action).

3.15.1.1.2 This is also granted when, due to a failure in the on-board radio communication
system, the on-board is no longer able to manage two communication sessions at
once. Thereby, the behaviour of the RBCs is independent from such on-board
degraded situation.

However, an RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one communication
session available may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to
“prepare” (session establishment, version determination, ...) the expected supervision
by the Accepting RBC until the on-board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC.

In level 3, trains following the one with only one communication session available will
always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from
the disconnection from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting
RBC.

Handing Over RBC

When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another
RBC area, it shall send:

a) Intentionally deleted.

b) To the Accepting RBC the following information:

e The ETCS identity of the on-board equipment;

e The border location that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting
RBC area;

e Current mode of the on-board equipment;

e Fora leading engine, Train Data and Train Running Number;

e The system versions supported by the on-board equipment;

e Optionally, for a non-leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine.

The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on-board equipment
concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding
information from the Accepting RBC.

It shall be possible for the Handing Over RBC to request route related information from
the Accepting RBC, limited to a maximum amount of data.

Route related information is :
a) Movement authorities
b) Linking

3.15.1.2.6 When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the maximum
safe front end of the train has passed the border location, it shall inform the Accepting
RBC.

3.15.1.2.6.1 Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting
RBC that the train has entered the Accepting RBC area.

3.15.1.2.7 When the Handing Over RBC receives a position report and detects that the minimum
safe rear end of the train has crossed the border, it shall send a disconnection order to
the on-board equipment.

3.15.1.2.8 When the Accepting RBC informs the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the
responsibility, the latter shall stop sending route related information to the on-board
equipment.

3.15.1.2.9 When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to
be cancelled, it shall send this cancellation information to the Accepting RBC (including
the train identification).

3.15.1.2.9.1 Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:
e Change to a route which does no more include the border;
e The sending of an “end of mission” information from the on-board equipment.

3.15.1.3 On-board equipment

3.15.1.3.1 When receiving an order to switch to another RBC at a given location, the on-board
equipment shall:

a) Establish the communication session with the Accepting RBC;

b) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the maximum safe front end
of the train passes the given location;

c) Send a position report to the Handing Over RBC when the minimum safe rear end
of the train passes the given location;

3.15.1.3.2 Exception to 3.15.1.3.1 a) (degraded situation): If the on-board equipment is able to
handle only one communication session at a given time, it shall wait until the session
with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the border and then establish
the session with the Accepting RBC.

3.15.1.3.3 As soon as the on-board equipment has established the session with the Accepting
RBC, it shall send its Train Data unless it is in sleeping or non leading mode.

3.15.1.3.4 When the on-board equipment is connected to both RBCs, it shall send its position
reports to both of them with the use of the position report parameters valid for the
Handing Over RBC.

3.15.1.3.4.1 If the on-board equipment is connected to both RBCs, and it executes an End of
Mission, it shall execute the End of Mission procedure with both RBCs

3.15.1.3.5 As soon as the on-board sends a position report directly to the Accepting RBC with its
maximum safe front end having passed the border, it shall use information received
from the Accepting RBC and only a disconnection order shall be accepted from the
Handing Over RBC.

3.15.1.3.5.1 Intentionally deleted.

3.15.1.3.6 While both communication sessions are opened, if information is received from the
Accepting RBC before a position report is sent to the Accepting RBC with the
maximum safe front end having passed the border, this information shall be stored on-
board.
Exception: The acknowledgement of Train Data shall be immediately accepted by the
on-board equipment.

3.15.1.3.6.1 Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to
Chapter 4 Use of received information.

3.15.1.3.7 When the train front end passes the announced border or when an order to execute
the RBC transition immediately is received, the on-board shall substitute the current
valid RBC ID/phone number with those of the Accepting RBC.

3.15.1.3.8 After this substitution, the on-board shall however retain the RBC ID/phone number of
the Handing Over RBC until at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:

a) Min safe rear end of the train has passed the border and the communication
session with this Handing Over RBC has been terminated,

b) The RBC transition order is deleted according to A.3.4 or 4.10.

Note: Even after the train front end has passed the border, the on-board may have
to maintain the communication session with the Handing Over RBC (see 3.5.4) or re-
establish it (see 3.5.3.4 f)) and needs therefore to remember the RBC ID/phone
number of this RBC.

In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has reported that the train has passed
with its min safe rear end the announced border and no order to terminate the session
is received from the Handing Over RBC within a fixed waiting time (see Appendix
A.3.1) from the time the position report was sent, it shall repeatedly send a position
report with the fixed waiting time after each repetition, until the order to terminate the
session is received, or the defined number of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has
been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last
repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication
session with the Handing Over RBC.

Accepting RBC

The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC
updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions.

As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on-board equipment a position report
and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility.

When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on-board equipment and
the Handing over RBC Train Data provided by the on-board equipment shall take
precedence.

If the Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Handing Over RBC,
it shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding on-
board equipment (if already established).

The Accepting RBC shall comply with the maximum amount of data contained in the
last received route related information request from the Handing Over RBC.

RBC/RBC message acknowledgement

As soon as a consistent RBC/RBC message including the request for
acknowledgement is received, the receiving RBC shall send an acknowledgement to
the emitting RBC.

The RBC/RBC message is consistent when all checks have been completed
successfully:

a) It has passed the checks performed by the RBC/RBC Safe Communication
Interface protocol (see SUBSET-098);

b) Variables in the message do not have invalid values.

Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines

It is possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being under
the control of a driver.

Only the leading engine is responsible for the train movement supervision functions.
Splitting/joining

ERTMS/ETCS allows Splitting and Joining using the normal supervision functions
available (e.g. On-sight, Shunting).

Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment each.

Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures.

ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect).

Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining
requires the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation has
been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection).

Reversing of movement direction

It shall be possible to send in advance to an on-board equipment information about
areas, where initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible, i.e. change the
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.

A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available
on-board.

Together with start and end of reversing area, the following supervision information
shall be sent:

a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing
area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area where reversing
of movement is permitted with which the maximum distance information is sent.

b) Reversing mode speed limit allowed during reverse movement.

3.15.5      Track ahead free

3.15.5.1 In a level 2/3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is able to handle a track
ahead free request given by the RBC.

3.15.5.2 The track ahead free request from the RBC shall indicate to the on-board

a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall begin to display the
request to the driver.

b) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop to display the
request to the driver (in case the driver did not acknowledge).

3.15.5.3 As long as it is displayed, the driver has the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead
free request (meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train
and the next signal or board marking signal position is free).

3.15.5.4 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall stop
displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free.

3.15.5.5 There is no restrictive consequence by the on-board system if the driver does not
acknowledge.

Amongst the data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS that can be
transmitted by trackside over the ERTMS/ETCS transmission channels, it shall be
possible to send from balises or RBC data to be forwarded to a National System.

Note: Definition of what qualifies as “data to be forwarded to a National System” is
national dependent and outside the scope of Subset 026.

Tolerance of Big Metal Mass

Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as defined in
Subset-036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm reporting
a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function.

In Levels 0/NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored
for a defined distance (see A.3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction.

Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all
excessive big metal masses with track condition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted
areas.

Cold Movement Detection

After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours.

When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, if
available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the
status of information stored by on-board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for
details).

Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as
not available if:

a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment, OR

b) the Cold Movement Detection function has encountered a condition, during the No
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement information (e.g. the
battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No
Power period).

Virtual Balise Cover

It shall be possible to set and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC). A VBC

is defined by:

a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on-board together with the
area (country or region) in which the VBC is applicable. The VBC marker and the
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity.

b) Its validity period.

During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to
remove an existing one.

As long as a VBC is stored on-board:

a) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ignore any balise telegram that
includes a VBC marker and a country/region identity that both match the VBC
identity.

b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise
telegram occur.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives from balise or from driver a new
VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace
the previous one, including its validity period.

A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on-board equipment is switched off (i.e.
enters No Power mode) and shall remain applicable when powered on again. It shall
be deleted when:

a
b

it is ordered by trackside, or

its validity period has elapsed, or
c
d

it is removed by the driver (during Start of Mission), or

a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from a balise group
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Note: this means that the reception of a
consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting a VBC due to
mismatching country/region identities.

Advance display of route related information

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display an overview of the gradient
profile (as received from trackside), of the MRSP, of the track conditions (except the
tunnel stopping areas), of the first Indication location, if any (only in Ceiling Speed
monitoring), and of the EOA/LOA, with the remaining distances referred to the train
front end position.

3.16.1      Criteria of consistency

3.16.1.1 The on-board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the
following criteria is not fulfilled.

a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and
respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid values

b) The message shall be received in due time.

c) The message shall be received at the right expected location.

3.16.1.1.1 Regarding a): a value of a variable is invalid when a spare value is used.
3.16.2      Balises

3.16.2.1 Definitions
3.16.2.1.1 The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram.

3.16.2.1.2 The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a balise
group is called a balise group message.

3.16.2.1.2.1 Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message
coincide.

3.16.2.1.3 Intentionally deleted.
3.16.2.2 General

3.16.2.2.1 lf the on-board is not able to recognise whether a balise group is linked or unlinked (if
none of the balises in the balise group can be read correctly), it shall consider it as
unlinked.

3.16.2.2.2 A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if

3.16.2.4.6 Instead of a message counter corresponding to a given balise group message, it shall
be possible to identify a telegram as always fitting all possible messages of the group.

3.16.2.4.6.1 It shall also be possible to identify a telegram as never fitting any message of the
group.

3.16.2.4.7 Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message,
excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2.4.6 and the ones that are not used by the on-
board to compose the message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2), if their values are not all identical,
or at least one of them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall be considered as a
message consistency error.

3.16.2.4.7.1 In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram
complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall also be considered as a message consistency
error.

3.16.2.7.2.1 If repositioning is announced and the expected repositioning balise group has been
found, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall keep looking for a balise group
that satisfies the same criteria as this previously expected and already found
repositioning balise group, until one of the following events occurs:

a) the on-board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise
group that was announced and already found

b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is found.

3.16.2.7.2.2 If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously
expected and already found repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall command the service brake and the driver shall be informed. At
standstill, the location based information stored on-board shall be shortened to the
current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which
shall be shortened.

3.16.2.7.2.3 Note: this function is independent from linking function, i.e. the rules related to
linking always apply. This means that once a repositioning balise group has been
found and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment will start expecting the first balise group announced in this new linking
information in parallel with the monitoring specified in 3.16.2.7.2.1.

a) Checks performed by Euroradio protocol have been passed (see Subset-037)
b) Time stamps checks have been passed (see 3.16.3.3.3)
c) Variables in the messages do not have in-valid values.

3.16.3.1.1.1 The on-board shall reject a message transmitted from the trackside if the message
is not consistent.

3.16.3.1.1.2 The on-board shall inform the trackside if a not consistent message is received.

3.16.3.1.2 Emergency messages shall be transmitted either as high priority data or as normal
priority data.

Time stamping
The trackside shall always transmit its information with reference to the train time.

To time-stamp its messages, the trackside shall make a safe estimation of the on-
board time, based on the time-stamp of the received messages and the internal
processing times. The estimation shall be made in such a way that the on-board time
estimated by the trackside shall not be in advance of the real on-board time.

Wrap around of the onboard timer can occur during a communication session and
shall have no impact on system behaviour.

Supervision of Sequence

The trackside shall time-stamp a message with a value corresponding to the time of
sending.

There shall always be a time stamp increment between consecutive messages.

If the time stamp of the last received message is lower than or equal to the former one
its content shall not be used.

Only time stamps of messages received as normal priority data shall be used.

3.17     System Version Management

3.17.1       Introduction

3.17.1.1 Definitions, high level principles and rules regarding the offline management of
ERTMS/ETCS system version during the ERTMS/ETCS system life time are given in
SUBSET-104.

3.17.1.2 | The objective of this section is to define requirements applicable to ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment and to trackside constituents, when different versions of the
ERTMS/ETCS system have been defined.

3.17.1.3 Intentionally deleted.

3.17.2      Determination of the operated system version

3.17.2.1 The on-board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of the
ERTMS/ETCS system version numbers X included in the envelope of legally operated
system versions, as defined in chapter 6.

3.17.2.1.1 Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on-board equipment shall
always operate the highest system version number Y defined in this release of the
SRS, regardless of the system version number Y transmitted by the trackside.

3.17.2.2 The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it
shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version
(refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one
introduced in this release of the SRS).

3.17.2.3 The on-board equipment shall determine the operated system version number X, in
relation to non-RBC trackside constituents, as the system version number X
transmitted by any balise, loop or RIU, if this system version number X is higher than
the currently operated one.

3.17.2.4 It shall be possible from balise group to order the on-board equipment to operate a
system version.

3.17.2.5 On receiving the order to operate system version from balise group, the on-board
equipment shall immediately operate the system version number X given in the order.
After the order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any
further received balise telegram/loop message or any further contacted RIU.

3.17.2.5.1 Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one.

3.17.2.6 If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a
balise/loop and the corresponding identifier(s) for which a set of national values is used
onboard, the on-board equipment shall consider the system version number X
transmitted by this balise/loop as the operated one and shall comply again with
requirement 3.17.2.3.

3.17.2.7 If the on-board equipment does not support the system version number X transmitted
by a non-RBC trackside constituent or the one specified in the balise group order, it
shall consider the operated system version as unchanged.

3.17.2.8 In case of communication session established with an RBC, the system version
number X of the RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation
to non-RBC constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the
operated system version number X shall be determined according to the following
principles:

a) if the on-board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2/3 area),
the RBC system version number X shall be operated when the transition to level 2/3
is executed;

b) if the on-board equipment is in level 2/3 (SoM procedure or order received from
trackside), the RBC system version number X shall be operated immediately;

c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the
accepting RBC system version number X shall be operated as soon as the engine
has passed the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end;

d) in case the on-board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.g. exit
from a level 2/3 area), the system version control in relation to non-RBC
constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again
considered;

e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe
front end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version
control in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise
group orders shall be again considered.

3.17.2.9 |The system version currently operated when the on-board equipment is switched off
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and re-used when powered on.

3.17.2.9.1 If the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), the highest
supported system version shall be used.

3.17.3      Handling of trackside data in relation to system version

3.17.3.1 Every telegram transmitted by a balise, and every message transmitted by Euroloop
and Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not

Trains shall be supervised according to the National Values of the current
infrastructure if they are available on-board.

National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are
applicable. They shall become applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable
immediately.

Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the
country or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used.

For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back
value if:

e the National Value is not available, or

e amismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set with which the
National Value was received and stored.

Note: even though the National Values are always transmitted as a single set for a
given system version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that
when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a
balise group, the on-board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of
National Values

The National Values currently applicable when the on-board equipment is switched off
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain applicable when
powered on.

Justification: The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been
received on-board, there is no need to re-load the information unless National Values
change, the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train
enters an area requiring different National Values.

The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on
transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values.

When a new set of National Values becomes applicable its content shall always
overwrite the corresponding National Values currently applicable regardless of the
country or region identifier(s).

A previously received set of National Values which is not yet applicable shall be

deleted if:

e anew set of National Values is received, or

e the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power
mode).

If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected between the
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s)

of the applicable set with which the National Value was received and stored, then it
shall be deleted.

3.18.2.11 When a new set of National Values becomes applicable, any ongoing supervision
involving an overwritten National Value of type time or distance shall continue, but
using the corresponding value from the new set. However, the starting location or
starting time shall remain unchanged.

3.18.3      Train Data

3.18.3.1 Train Data can neither be provided nor modified by ERTMS/ETCS trackside
equipment.

A.3.3 Handling of information received from trackside

A.3.3.1    Before it can be accepted and used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, raw
information received from trackside is subject to various checks, which can lead to the
individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the
train orientation), the ignoring of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole
message. The SRS clauses/sections corresponding to these checks are gathered in

Table 17: Check of raw data received from trackside

With the exception of the clauses/sections referred to in Table 17 and of the clause
3.16.3.5.1, all the clauses in this specification in which trackside information is referred
to (through the terms “balise”, “telegram”, “balise group [message]’, “message”,
“[name of] information’...), shall be applied assuming that the information has not been
ignored/rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment due to all the checks listed
in Table 17.

Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: “If a <consistent>
message <composed with telegrams that have passed the system version check, that
have not been ignored because of a VBC, that have not been ignored because of
duplication, and that have been received while no reverse movement was performed>
has been received <with one of its telegrams composing it> containing the information
“default balise information” <which is valid for the train orientation (or the balise group
crossing direction for NL or SL engines) and which has passed the level and mode
filters>, the driver shall be informed.”

Example 2: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
will not apply requirements in relation to the content of the telegram or the message
such as:

e clause 3.16.3.3.3.1, in case the radio message is rejected because of its time
stamp, this latter will not be used by the on-board to check the supervision of
sequence of further messages

e clause 3.17.2.3, in case the balise telegram is ignored because of its system
version number (e.g. according to 3.17.3.5 d)), this latter will not affect the system
version operated by the on-board

is rejected because the balise group was not announced by linking (see

Handling of Accepted and Stored Information in specific
Situations

Introduction

All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special
situations.

The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are:

a
b

the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2);
the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4);

c
d

the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2);

the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time-out
(3.8.4.4.2) ;

e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2);
f) acooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2);

g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill
(3.16.2.5.2);

h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ;

i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ;

j) the train category, axle load category, loading gauge or traction system is changed
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ;

k) driver closes the desk during SoM ;

1)) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at
standstill (3.16.2.7)

A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations

A.3.5.1     Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside,
the on-board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither
reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse
movement (initiated by driver or due to roll-away) and the sub-sequent forward
movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG. This rule shall
apply to the following actions:

e Change of National Values (see 3.18.2)
e Request to acknowledge new level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10)
e Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3)

e Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode transition due to mode profile (see
3.12.4)

e Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3)
e Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1)

e Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big
metal masses and non stopping areas

e Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4)
e Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)
e Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6)

e Substitute the supervision of the LX start location as the EOA/SvL by the inclusion
of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP (see 5.16.2 and 5.16.3)

A.3.5.2    Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has received a balise group message
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s)
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related
to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed.

A.3.5.2.1 Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna,
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the
EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the
replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on-board as happening before the
min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause
3.13.10.2.7 applies).

A.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA/LOA
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not

lead to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR’.
In other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA/LOA and the end of override
procedure (see 5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on-board as
simultaneously happening before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOQA/LOA
location.

Deletion of accepted and stored information when used

Standard case

When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied
by trackside information no longer used, i.e., the related on-board functionality has
been completed, shall be made available immediately.

Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity
available on-board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information
stored on-board given in Subset 040.

Exception

Following information shall remain stored on-board for a distance defined by a fixed
value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train:

e location dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR
(see 3.11.2.2)

e gradient information,
e reduced adhesion information received from trackside,

e Track condition “Big metal masses’.

Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement:

e With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”, the stored
information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to calculate speed
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver)

e Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track.

A.3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is

determined by a National/Default value. This is also true for a reverse movement in
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately.
In order to keep the on-board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chosen
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is
no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is made available again.

Calculation of the basic deceleration

The brake percentage (A) shall be converted into two different input parameters:

Ao = A for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))

No = MIN (A, 135) for calculation of service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V))
where A is the brake percentage defined as part of Train Data.

The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm
that will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake.

The speed limit for the first step shall be calculated as V_lim = x * Ad’.
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h

X= 16.85

y = 0.428

The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as AD_O=A*)A. +B

AD_0 is the basic deceleration in m/s? for 0 < speed < V_lim.

A = 0.0075

B = 0.076

The following steps of the basic deceleration shall be calculated by means of a set of
polynomials of the third order with the following format:

AD_n=a3_n* Ao? + a2_n*A?+al1_n*\o+a0_n

and with the following values for n (all speed limits in km/h):

n=1          valid for V_lim < speed < 100         if V_lim < 100
to be ignored                             if V_lim > 100

n=2          valid for V_lim < speed < 120         if 100 < V_lim < 120
valid for 100 < speed < 120           if V_lim < 100
to be ignored                             if V_lim > 120

n=3          valid for V_lim < speed < 150         if 120 < V_lim < 150
valid for 120 < speed < 150           if V_lim < 120
to be ignored                             if V_lim > 150

n=4          valid for V_lim < speed < 180         if 150 < V_lim < 180
valid for 150 < speed < 180           if V_lim s 150
to be ignored                             if V_lim > 180

n=5              valid for V_lim < speed                    if V_lim > 180

A.3.9.6   The values of a, b, c and kto used in A.3.9.1, A.3.9.2, A.3.9.3 and A.3.9.4 define
reference values for the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake, which
shall be considered as maximum ones. If justified by the specific brake system of the
train other values of these coefficients, which lead to shorter values of the equivalent
brake build up time for the service brake, may be used.

A.3.9.7   Note: Although certain trains may perform better, the reference values for the
equivalent brake build up time for the service brake, as defined here, are the
appropriate basis for infrastructure planning.

A.3.10 Service brake feedback

A.3.10.1 The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves.

A.3.10.2 |The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if:
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND

b) The national value does not inhibit its use.

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe
pressure and brake cylinder pressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted
into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way:

p = fictive main brake pipe pressure (kPa)

p_cylinder = brake cylinder pressure (kPa)

k1 = vehicle dependent constant (set by engineering of ETCS on-board; k1 is normally
between 2.0 and 2.7)

p= 500 - p_cylinder /k1

The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algorithm
to take the service brake feedback into account:

p = current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in
A.3.10.3)

pO = reference pressure when not braking

p1 = pressure at which the train starts to brake = pO - 30

p2 = pressure limit, under which T_bs1 and T_bs2 are locked = pO - 60

p3 = pressure at full service brake = pO - 150

Q_feedback_active = a Boolean stating whether the feedback function is active, i.e.
once it has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the ceiling speed monitoring is
entered.

Q_Tbslocked = a boolean stating whether T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to the
following values due to enough main brake pipe pressure reduction:

T_bs1_locked = Os.

T_bs2_locked = 2s.

Q_displaylocked_P = a boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed is
locked due to SB feedback.

Q_displaylocked_SBI = a boolean stating whether the displayed SBI speed (if any) is
locked due to SB feedback.

Q_displaylocked_TD = a boolean stating whether the displayed target distance is
locked due to SB feedback.

A displayed value is locked from the moment the SB feedback has started to reduce
T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the calculated value becomes less than the displayed and
locked value. Note: It is only SB feedback that can start the locking of the displayed
values. Once started and still locked it remains locked also in case the calculated
values are increased due to other reasons (e.g. due to relocation), which will prolong
the locking period.

Initial values when the target speed monitoring is entered or when the release speed
monitoring is entered not from target speed monitoring:

The reference pressure p0 (nominal value 500 kPa) shall be set on starting the ETCS:
a) To the first stable p value between 400-550 kPa achieved.

b) — Stable in this instance means that the pressure has not varied more than +
20 kPa over 3 seconds.

The reference pressure pO shall thereafter be adapted to the current pressure
according to the following table (which applies if the calculation is performed once per
second):

Where:

-      p is limited to max 550 kPa.
-      Values given in kPa.

A.3.10.5 Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to Os and 2 s on approaching a non zero
target, the locking will remain even if the train speed comes below the target speed.
This avoids “jumping” indications related to the values of T_bs1 and T_bs2. It also
makes it possible to release the brakes before a speed reduction, without having the
curves moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the
driver releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety
issue. To keep 2 s between the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated
first and thus may avoid emergency brake.

A.3.10.6 Note: If feedback is active but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback function
will remain active until the ceiling speed monitoring is entered. This avoids “jumping”
indications in some rare situations.

ISOLATION

Description

In Isolation mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be physically isolated
from the brakes and can be isolated from other on-board equipments/systems
depending on the specific on-board implementation.

There shall be a clear indication to the driver that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment is isolated.

To leave Isolation mode, a special operating procedure is needed (no transition from
Isolation is specified). This procedure shall ensure that the on-board equipment is only
put back into service when it has been proven that this is safe for operation.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

Used in levels

Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC.

Responsibilities

Isolation of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is performed by the driver under his
complete responsibility.

Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is isolated, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment has no more responsibility.

NO POWER

Description

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not powered, the equipment is in the
No Power mode.

Note: in order to ensure cold movement detection function, some parts of the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment may be fed by an auxiliary power supply.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall permanently command the emergency
brake.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

Used in levels

Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC.

Responsibilities

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has no responsibility in this mode, except
commanding the emergency brake and (optionally) monitoring cold movements.

The notion of responsibility of the driver is not relevant for the No Power mode.

If it is required to move a loco in NP mode as a wagon, ETCS brake command must
be overridden by external means.

SLEEPING

Description

The Sleeping mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a
slave engine that is remote controlled.

The desk(s) of a sleeping engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no
information shall be shown).

As the engine is remote controlled by the leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to
train front/rear end.

Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on-board via the train interface.

If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to memorise the
occurrence of such fault(s), which should be handled when the engine leaves the
Sleeping mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should also try to send an
error information to the RBC.

If a desk of the sleeping engine is opened while the train is running (this is an
abnormal operation), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand-By
mode.

If the “sleeping input signal” is lost (no more detection of the remote control), the
switch to Stand-By mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill.

Intentionally deleted.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall open a communication session with the
RBC when at least one of the following events occurs:

a) in all levels, on receipt of the order to contact the RBC.

b) In level 2/3, when entering or exiting Sleeping mode (to report the change of mode
to the RBC).

c) In level 2/3, when a safety critical fault of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
occurs (to report the fault to the RBC).

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1),
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

SHUNTING

Description

The purpose of the Shunting mode is to enable shunting movements. In Shunting
mode, The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise the train movements
against:

a) aceiling speed: the shunting mode speed limit

b) a list of expected balise groups (if such list was sent by the trackside equipment).
The train shall be tripped if a balise group, not contained in the list, is passed
(When an empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent,
all balise groups can be passed)

c) “stop if in shunting mode” information. The train is tripped if such information is
received from balise groups

d) Intentionally deleted

The Shunting mode shall not require Train Data.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function
Intentionally deleted.

When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage level
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level
transition order shall be stored and evaluated only when another mode than Shunting
or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the Shunting movement is
terminated).

When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board in Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store
the RBC ID/phone number.

When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-RBC
hand-over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number given at the RBC/RBC border.

Shunting mode can be selected by the driver, only accepted when the train is at
standstill, or ordered by the trackside.

In case of selection of Shunting mode by the driver:

e in level 1 operations, the switch to shunting is always accepted by the on-board
equipment

e in level 2 and 3 areas, the on-board asks the trackside for an authorisation. The
switch to shunting is possible only after receiving such authorisation. The trackside
can send a list of balises, that the train is allowed to pass while in SH, together with
the authorisation

STAFF RESPONSIBLE

Description

The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area.

This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example:

a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment starts-up (awakening of the train).

b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA.

c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:

a

a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit

a given distance (regarding its origin location see 4.4.11.1.3.1). The ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves with a target speed of zero to
the end of this distance. If the train overpasses this distance (see next note) the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trip the train

a list of expected balise groups, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train
shall be tripped if over-passing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an
empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise
groups can be passed)

balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the
train, unless the over-passed balise group is included in a list of expected balises
as defined in item c)

running in the direction opposite to the train orientation (reverse movement
protection)

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall determine the start location of the SR distance

as follows:

a)

If the National/Default value determines the max permitted distance to run in SR
mode, the starting point of this distance shall refer to the estimated position of the
train front when SR mode was entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode,
when Override was activated.

If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value
transmitted by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the start location of the distance
shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when the distance information
is received or entered.

If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value
transmitted by EUROLOOP, the distance information transmitted by EUROLOOP
shall be referred to one or more reference balise groups. On-board shall evaluate

the LRBG.

In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the
distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information,
the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance
given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and
the LRBG.

1.4 Note: Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff
Responsible mode does not ensure that the train will not pass the given distance.

possibility to request a new distance to run in Staff Responsible, by selecting "Start".
This triggers an MA request.

1.6.1       Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further.

1.6.2     When entering SR mode, the value applicable for SR mode speed limit and the
value applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default values.
Exception for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance.

1.6.3     While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if
available, the last value entered by the driver.

1.6.4      While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available,
the last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment amongst:

a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver;

b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside.

1.6.5      When "Override" is selected, the SR mode speed limit value and the SR distance
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The
corresponding National/Default values shall enter in force.

TRIP

Description
Deleted

Note: Application of emergency brakes and train trip are two different things. For
example, exceeding the permitted speed leads to application of the emergency brakes,
but as long as the train does not pass the EOA/LOA, it is not a train trip.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency brakes (no
brake release is possible in Trip mode).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall indicate to the driver the reason of the
train trip.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall request an acknowledgement from the
driver once train is at standstill (to allow the driver to acknowledge the train trip).

Note: This acknowledgement is mandatory to exit from Trip mode.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes

4.4.14.1.1 The Post Trip mode shall be entered immediately after the driver acknowledges the
trip.

4.4.14.1.2 Once in post trip mode, the onboard equipment shall release the Command of the
emergency brake.

4.4.14.1.2.1      The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall keep on indicating to the driver the
reason of the train trip.

4.4.14.1.3 The train shall only be authorised to move backwards a given distance (national value).
The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise this national distance for
reverse movements, and shall command the service brakes if the distance is over-
passed. The driver shall be informed about the reason for the brake application.

4.4.14.1.3.1     Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement
Protection (as in PT mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in PT
mode). This implies that the given distance to run backwards in PT is considered as a
directional data, oriented backwards.

4.4.14.1.3.2     After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed distance
allowed for moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall command the service brake for any further movement in the direction
opposite to the train orientation.

4.4.14.1.4 When moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the train trip shall be inhibited.
4.4.14.1.5 Intentionally deleted.

4.4.14.1.6 When ERTMS/ETCS level is 1, if the driver selects “Start” the onboard equipment
proposes Staff Responsible. When ERTMS/ETCS level is 2 or 3, the selection of Start
leads to an MA Request to the RBC. It is the RBC responsibility to give an SR
authorisation, or a Full Supervision MA or an On Sight/Shunting MA to an

NON LEADING

Description

The Non-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
of a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not
remote controlled) but has its own driver.

Note: This operating situation is called Tandem.

4.4.15.1.1.2     The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to

enter in Non-Leading mode, a “non leading input signal" from the train interface.

mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not perform any train movement
supervision in Non-Leading mode.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to
train front/rear end.

When level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position to
the RBC, according to the previously received parameters.

If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a non-leading
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to memorise the
occurrence of such fault(s), which should be handled when the engine leaves Non
Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should also try to send an
error information to the RBC.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed to the driver.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

The supervision of linking consistency shall not be performed in Non Leading mode.

In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1),
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

REVERSING

Description

The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This is
possible only in areas so marked by trackside.

Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against:
a) aceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside

b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation, given from
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance

After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing
distance, and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the
direction opposite to the train orientation.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted
speed and the remaining distance to run.

In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3 table 5, triggering
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency
brake instead of the service brake. For the revocation of the brake command, refer to
3.13.10.2.4.

The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the
driving cab (as before reversing).

Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement
Protection (as in RV mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV
mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a
directional data, oriented backwards.

Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes
and on-board functions”.

4.4.18.1.10In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1),

the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake.

4.4.18.1.11In case there is an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission

function, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall ignore this alarm.

4.4.19      LIMITED SUPERVISION

4.4.19.1 Description

4.4.19.1.1 The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas where
trackside information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train.

4.4.19.1.2 Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered
automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled.

4.4.19.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against a
dynamic speed profile.

4.4.19.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed and the release
speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive - refer to chapter 4.7 “DMI depending on
modes”). Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the
generic LS function marker is stored on-board or if the conditions in clause
4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also display the
lowest speed amongst:

a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the
EOA/LOA, AND
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA

4.4.19.1.4.1     The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised
Speed within the Movement Authority (LSSMA)

4.4.19.1.4.2    Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board

equipment shall start a delay timer:

a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the message
including the order.

b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first
encountered balise of the balise group giving the order.

c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer
(see section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed.

4.4.19.1.4.3     When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the LSSMA.

4.4.19.1.4.4     On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the LSSMA display, a toggle on
order which has not been executed yet (because the on-board delay timer has not
reached the delay time-out value) shall be deleted by the on-board equipment.

4.4.19.1.4.5   If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall toggle off the LSSMA display in case:

a) the clause 4.4.19.1.4.3 is not immediately fulfilled upon reception of a new order to
toggle on the LSSMA display

b) an order to toggle off the LSSMA display is received.
4.4.19.1.4.6   When entering the Limited Supervision mode, the LSSMA display shall be
toggled off by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, unless a toggle on order is

received and leads immediately to the display of the LSSMA as per clauses
4.4.19.1.4.2 and 4.4.19.1.4.3.

4.4.19.1.4.7      If the generic LS function marker is not stored on-board, the clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2
to 4.4.19.1.4.6 shall not apply and the LSSMA shall be displayed if:

a) the target speed at the EOA/LOA is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed
limit, AND

b) the LSSMA is lower than the maximum train speed.

4.4.19.1.4.8     The generic LS function marker shall be deleted by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment as soon as a Limited Supervision mode profile is received without it in the
same balise group message.

4.4.19.1.5 If receiving a "track ahead free" request from the RBC, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment requests the driver to enter the "track ahead free" information.

4.4.19.1.6 To be in Limited Supervision mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole
length of the train, but shall be at least available from the FRONT END of the train.

4.4.19.3 Responsibilities

4.4.19.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is responsible for the background supervision
of the train movement to the extent permitted by the information provided by trackside.

4.4.19.3.1.1     Note: The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas
equipped with lineside signals where ETCS does not have information regarding the
status of some signals, i.e. not all signals are fitted with LEUs or connected to an RBC

4.4.19.3.2 The driver must always observe the existing line-side information (signals, speed
boards etc.) and National operating rules.

4.4.19.3.2.1     Note: the indications given to the driver by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board

4.4.20      PASSIVE SHUNTING

4.4.20.1 Description

4.4.20.1.1 The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the
leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry
on a shunting movement with a single engine fitted with one on-board equipment and
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab.

4.4.20.1.2 The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no
information shall be shown).

4.4.20.1.3 As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall not perform any train movement supervision.

4.4.20.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform Train Position function; in
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to
train front/rear end.

4.4.20.1.5 It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode;
while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function
“Continue Shunting on desk closure”.

4.4.20.1.6 When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to
Passive Shunting mode if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active
and the “passive shunting input signal” is received from the train interface. If the
function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the “passive shunting
input signal” is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to
Stand-By mode instead.

4.4.20.1.7 The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” shall allow one and only one
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be
inactive once the Shunting mode is left.

4.4.20.1.8 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and no “Stop Shunting on desk
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode.

4.4.20.1.9 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Stop Shunting on desk
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode.

4.4.20.1.10If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which should be handled when the engine
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

4.4.20.1.11 When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage level
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level
transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only when another mode than
Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the Shunting movement is
terminated).

4.4.20.1.12When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board in Passive Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but
shall store the RBC ID/phone number information.

4.4.20.1.13When in Passive Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-
RBC hand-over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number information given at the
RBC/RBC border.

4.4.20.1.14Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter 4.5 “Modes

Transitions between modes

Symbols

The indication “4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition

From the mode located in the column

To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “>”.

Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “-px-”, x is the
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at
the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2.

Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and
the transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order).

"16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

4.7       DMI depending on modes

4.7.1      Introduction

4.7.1.1    The DMI is an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the
driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information
done via the train interface (e.g. a driver's action on the service brake used for the
service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI.

4.7.1.2     The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered”
is (are) not part of the DMI.

4.7.1.3    The device(s) used to select/indicate “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI.

4.7.1.4      Intentionally deleted.

4.7.1.5    Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is not included in the following section.

4.7.2        DMI versus Mode Table

4.7.2.1.1_ X= active: For a DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column. For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the
column).

4.7.2.1.2 A = available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here.

4.7.2.1.3 Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system.

4.7.2.1.4 NA = Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and
outputs cannot be determined.

Acceptance of received information

Introduction

The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of which information is accepted or
rejected depending on the state of the on-board (level, mode) and the nature of the
received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill).

The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the
level and transmission media’, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information
depending on the modes”.

If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that
message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information.

Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first
considering the on-board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1], [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied,
shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from
the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level.

Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a
change of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This
implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment - still
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes
in which this information is otherwise useless.

If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all
other non-infill information in that message.

When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP

Assumptions

The following tables shall be applied assuming that:

a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and
with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16)

b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation,
or the balise group crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines).(see section
3.6.3)

c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A”
(Accepted) comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this
information is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over’ RBC is
still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed
Exception 1: The information “Acknowledgement of Train Data’, “Trackside
constituent system version”, "Session Management" and “Acknowledgement of
Session     Termination"     shall     be     immediately     accepted.
Exception 2: The information “Co-operative shortening of MA”, “Revocation of
Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected.

d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG (i.e.
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3).

e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed
(see clause 3.14.3.6)

Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be
decoded, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” is
only used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly
read, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction’, if
received, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need
not to be referred to in the following tables.

In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any
further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)).
Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group
message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need
not to be referred to in the following tables.

Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), what will happen to the data to be used
by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an
external application, processed by a national function...) is outside the scope of this
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
functionality.

Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or
RBC/RBC handover

If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3 at a further location has been received, the
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see
figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages.

If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC.

Note: the term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the
transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immediately)
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or
according to 4.8.2.1¢ (for RBC/RBC handover).

In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored.

The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted:

a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition
order for a different level, OR

b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to
another Accepting RBC, OR

c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored
information is terminated

At the same time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting
RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition
buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received.

This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to
any use by the on-board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change
of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the
following principles:

a) Starting from the information currently used by on-board at the moment the
level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted.

b) For each information update related to a re-evaluated set of information, the same
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted
outside a level/RBC transition context.

c) The information resulting from this sequential update shall then be used by the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table
4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be
accepted or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given
stop location. This decision, based on the comparison between the min safe front end
position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location,
shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4).

Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the
information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see
clause 3.10.2.3) when re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information
accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10.

Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time when
the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed.
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

What happens to accepted and stored information when
entering a given level

Introduction

Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a
level transition.

A level transition acts on the “status” of stored information.

In case of entering level 1, MA Request Parameters, Position Report Parameters and
Track Ahead Free Request shall be deleted.

In case of entering level 0, NTC or 1, the information “Inhibition of revocable TSRs
from balises in L2/3” shall be deleted.

For all other stored data, a level transition has no effect (void).

Introduction

Scope and Purpose

This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the
scope of ERTMS/ETCS.

Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and, where convenient,
is illustrated by a flowchart.

In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures.

Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e. g. cut
off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment).

National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is
retained.

Definitions

Procedures

A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems
and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or
events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.

Entities

The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the
entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.

States

States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions
and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not
completely satisfied.

Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.

Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another
one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force
branching in states.

Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is
triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the
same time. When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditions
to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

Procedure Start of mission

Introduction

The driver may have to start a mission:
a
b

Once the train is awake, OR

Once shunting movements are finished, OR
c
d

Once a mission is ended, OR

Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine.

The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in
Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be
already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation.

Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission
is not the only possibility, the engine may become remote controlled (i.e. the on-board
switches to Sleeping mode).

Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment

At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of
three states:

a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct)

b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong)

c) “Unknown” (no stored value available)

This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3).

Note 1: The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode".

Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table
in section 5.4.3.3.

Table of requirements for “Start of Mission” procedure

The ID numbers in the table are used for the representation of the procedure in form of
a flow chart in section 5.4.4.

Procedure

ID #

Requirements

So

The Start of Mission procedure shall be engaged when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment is in Stand-By mode with a desk open and no communication session is
established or is being established.

S1

Depending on the status of the Driver-ID, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
request the driver to enter the Driver-ID (if the Driver-ID is unknown) or shall request
the driver to revalidate or re-enter the Driver-ID (if the Driver-ID is invalid).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the driver the possibility to
enter/re-validate (depending on the status) the Train running number.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also offer the driver the possibility to
set/remove a Virtual Balise Cover.

Once the Driver-ID is entered or revalidated (E1) (possibly further to the Train running
number entry/revalidation and/or to Virtual Balise Cover setting/removal), the process
shall go to D2

D2

If both the stored position and the stored level are valid, the process shall go to D3

If the stored position or the stored level is “invalid” or “unknown”, the process shall go
to S2

D3

If the stored level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to D7

If the stored level is 0,1 or NTC, the process shall go to S10

D7

If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go
to A31

If no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go to S4

S2

If the status of the Level data is "unknown", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall request the driver to enter it.

If the status of the Level data is "invalid", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
request the driver to re-validate or re-enter the ERTMS/ETCS level.

If the entered / re-validated level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to S3

If the entered / re-validated level is 0, 1 or one of proposed NTC level(s) (see 3.18.4.2
for the levels the driver is allowed to select), the process shall go to S10

S3         The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to re-
enter the Radio Network ID. If the driver elects to do so, the on-board equipment shall
terminate the ongoing communication session, if any. As soon as the related safe
connection is released, the on-board equipment shall acquire an alphanumeric list of
available and allowed networks, based on a request to the Mobile Terminal(s):
e If this list is empty (E3) the process shall go to A29
e If the driver selects a new Radio Network ID from the proposed list, the
registration of the Mobile Terminal(s) to this new Radio Network shall be
ordered and if not “unknown” the status of the RBC-ID/phone number shall be
immediately set to “invalid”.
If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment shall offer the following options to the driver for the RBC-
ID/phone number:
e Only if the status of the RBC-ID/phone number is “invalid” or “valid”: order the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to use the last stored RBC-ID/phone
number
e Order the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to use the EIRENE short
number (trackside call routing function)
e Enter the RBC-ID/phone number (if its status is "unknown"), or revalidate/re-
enter it (if its status is “invalid” or “valid”).
Once the driver has selected the first or second option or once data is validated (E5),
the process shall go to A31
S4          The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall wait until:
e at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network (E6); in such
case the process shall go to A31, OR
e asufficient time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) is elapsed since it has sent the latest
Radio Network registration order to a Mobile Terminal (E7); in such case the
process shall go to A29
A29        The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver that the Radio Network

registration has failed

This condition leads to S10 (the driver has to unlock the situation to continue e.g.
selection of new level)

$10          The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to select
SH, NL, or to select Train Data Entry.
e If the driver selects SH (E12), the process shall continue in the same way as the
procedure         “Shunting         initiated         by         the         driver”.
If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting (E13), the process shall
go back to $10.
e If the driver selects NL (E10) then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch to Non Leading mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transition
between modes: transition [46]). The mission starts in NL mode (if level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment also reports the change of mode to the
RBC).
e If the driver selects Train Data Entry (E11), the process shall go to $12
e Following E10, E12, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall
delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”)
$12         The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall request the driver to enter/revalidate the
Train Data that requires driver validation.
Once Train Data is stored and validated (E16), the process shall go to D12
D12         If Train running number is valid, the process shall go to D10
If Train running number is “unknown” or “invalid”, the process shall go to $13
$13        If the status of the Train running number is "unknown" or “invalid”, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment shall request the driver to enter/re-validate the Train running
number now.
Once Train running number is entered/re-validated (E18), the process shall go to D10.
D10          When the validated level is 2/3, the process shall go to D11
When the validated level is 0,1 or NTC, the process shall go to S20
D11          When the session is open, the process shall go to $11, otherwise it shall go to $10
$11         The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall send Train Data to the RBC.

When the RBC acknowledges Train Data (E14), then the ERTMS/ETCS onboard
equipment shall go to the step S20.

Degraded Situations

Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has
not been taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10.

The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does
not exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while
performing the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or
when the driver needs to re-enter already captured data).

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also offer the driver the following
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3:

a) only at S10 and S20 and if the conditions defined in 5.8.2.1 for Stand By are
fulfilled, to select “Override”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall
go to the procedure “Override” and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board shall delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”)

b) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Driver-ID
c) only at S10 and S20,to re-enter the “Train running number”

d) only at S20, to re-enter the Train data. If the driver chooses to do so, then the
process shall go to $12.

e) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, then the
process shall go to S2

=a

only at S20, to select “Non Leading”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode
and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train
position data (new status: “unknown’).

g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process
shall go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still
invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train position data (new status:
“unknown’). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process
shall go back to S20.

h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available, to select “Start”. If the driver chooses to
do so:
e ifthe level is 0, then the process shall go to S23.
e ifthe level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22.
e if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24.
e ifthe level is 2/3 and a session is open, then the process shall go to S21.
e ifthe level is 2/3 and no session is open, then the process shall go to S24.

the Radio Network ID.

Entry to Mode Considered as a Mission

A mission is considered as started as soon as the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
enters FS, LS, SR, OS, NL, UN, or SN mode.

Entry in all other modes, from SB mode, is not considered as a mission.

Procedure End of Mission

Introduction

End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment when entering specific modes (see below).

Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission:

Stand-By mode

From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL, SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode is considered as an End of Mission

Note: While in SN mode (level NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may
depend on the National System.

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode, from PT
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission.

Intentionally deleted
Shunting mode

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS,
LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission.

The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission.

Note: While in SN mode (level NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may
depend on the National System.

End of Mission Procedure

The procedure comprises the following steps

Step 1- MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode
dependent, see Chapter 4, section "What happens to accepted and stored information
when Entering a Mode").

End of Procedure, if there is no existing communication session.

If a communication session with an RIU exists:

Step 2- The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication
session

End of procedure

If a communication session with an RBC exists:

Step 2- The end of mission shall be reported to the RBC by means of the message
“End of Mission’.

Step 3- The RBC shall request to terminate the communication session.

Step 4- The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication
session

End of procedure

Note: For the termination of the communication session refer to chapter 3,
Management of Radio Communication.

Note: The “End of Mission” message contains a position report.

Intentionally deleted.

Degraded Situation

Level 2,3 : In case a communication session is established and no request to terminate
the communication session is received from the RBC within a fixed waiting time (see
appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after sending the “End of Mission”
message, the message shall be repeated with the fixed waiting time after each
repetition.

After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value
Data), and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the time of the last
sending of “End of Mission’, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the
communication session.

Level 2,3 : In case no communication session is open, no communication session shall
be established to report the end of mission.

Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside

General Requirements

This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.

Note: The shunting area, possibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed
according to the relevant procedure.

The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile, optionally
with a list of balises groups, which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment is in shunting mode.

The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires
a driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below.

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed.

Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from
Stand By and Post Trip)

In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the
shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is
possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment the order to switch to shunting
at the current location.

Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for
which switching to SH mode is requested.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless
the command was triggered also for other reasons).

Shunting is requested for a further location

An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent

a) ina level 1 area by a balise group,

b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC.

A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two
conditions are fulfilled:

a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile

b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or value
given in the mode profile)

Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates).

Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode, the beginning
of the shunting area shall be considered as the EOA (instead of the EOA/LOA derived
from the MA) and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the
mode profile either:

a) as the SvL derived from the MA. In case the MA defines an LOA, the SvL shall be
derived as if no LOA had been given.

OR

b) as the beginning of the shunting area.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes).

If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area
according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes).

If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement
time (refer to Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons).

Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the
driver.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform
transition to Shunting mode.

Procedure Override

Introduction

In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track
circuit, failed point...), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority.

For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority can be required in
degraded situations, e.g.

e In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip).

e In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the
interface between RBCs is unavailable).

e In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two
adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established).
e In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection
with the interlocking)

e In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route
cannot be set)

e In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened
due to a time-out).

In level 0/NTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not
supervise the train movements.

In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Receiving an order from the
signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority, the driver must then be able to
inhibit this supervision.

Note: The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures.

If a signal at danger must be passed between announcement and execution of the
level transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National
System (level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalman gives
the order to the driver to select “override”.

Note: By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the train driving.
Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects “override”.

In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:

a) transmitting "stop if in SR mode"

e) Intentionally deleted

Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4)

Selection of “Override”
The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” only
when:

a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override”
function (national value) AND

b) The current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff
Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only) or SN
(National System) AND

c) Validated Train Data and Train running number are available (except when already
in Shunting mode).

Intentionally deleted.

The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver.

Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered

The mode shall change as follows:

a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand-By or
Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if
the mode is already SR it remains unchanged)

b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged

c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or SN (level NTC area) the mode shall
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes)

If the mode, when activating Override, is OS, LS or FS, the former EOA/LOA shall be
retained. If the mode is SB or PT, the current position of the train front shall be
considered as the former EOA/LOA.

Note: This former EOA/LOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is
no longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on
the former EOA/LOA.

The former EOA/LOA shall be deleted if:
a) the train reads the information “stop if in SR mode” from a balise group OR

b) SR mode is left.

Note 1: In level 2, 3, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that
the Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is
any)

Note 2: In level 2,3, if the ERTMS/ETCS- onboard equipment is able to report the
mode change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR
mode (overriding the national value), a list of balises to be passed in SR mode (refer
to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)

Note 3: In level 2,3, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes
all emergency stop orders previously received.

In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode)

The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and
only in level 0, 1, 2, 3, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed
Restriction (see 3.11.10) as long as the Override function is active.

The status “override active” shall be indicated to the driver.

Exception 1: In case the Override function has been activated by an STM (see
SUBSET-035), the status “override active” shall not be indicated to the driver.

Exception 2: In case the Override function has been activated by selection of
“Override” while being in level 0, 1, 2 or 3, the status “override active” shall stop to be
indicated to the driver on executing a transition to level NTC.

As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from
EUROLOOP shall be rejected.

When “Override” is selected and Override is already active, the supervision of the time
and distance (see 5.8.4.1 a) and b)) for train trip suppression shall be re-started.

End of Override procedure
The Override procedure shall end when at least one of the following conditions is
fulfilled:

a) The "max. time for train trip suppression when Override function is triggered"
(national value) elapses after Override has been selected, OR

b) The train has run more than the "distance for train trip suppression when Override
function is triggered" (national value) after Override has been selected, OR

Procedure On-Sight

General Requirements

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the
beginning of the On Sight area.

An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The
conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.

On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from
Stand By and Post Trip)

In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that
gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On
Sight mode.

In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode
profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe
front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch
to On Sight mode.

The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall
be displayed to the driver.

If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command
is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for
another reason(s).

Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed
cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the
train speed was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was
allowed in Full Supervision mode, in Limited Supervision mode or in Staff Responsible
mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered,
independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight
supervision (see Figure 4).

Figure 4: Train enters OS area with too high speed

Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or Limited
Supervision mode by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = OS mode speed
limit) at the location of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral
signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the
OS mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.

On Sight is requested for a further location
The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached
yet. This occurs when:

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is
located at a further location.

b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is
located at a further location.

A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following
conditions are fulfilled:

a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.

b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or value
given in the mode profile).

c) The current mode is not On Sight
The conditions 5.9.3.2 a) and b) define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.

Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train
accelerates).

On Sight from Unfitted or SN mode

The mode profile with regards to an OS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN
mode). A transition to On Sight mode can therefore earliest occur at a transition of
level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.9.2 shall apply.

On Sight from Stand By or Post Trip mode

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the
driver.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform
the transition to On Sight mode.”

Exit of On Sight mode

General rule

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode when the min
safe front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area.

First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA

This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has
the same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA.

In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On
Sight area.

Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of
the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of
the On Sight area. This information

e can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside
scope of ERTMS/ETCS), or

e can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends
a “track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the
current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this
information to the RBC.

5.9.6.2.4 Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to transmit
an MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

5.9.6.3      Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA/LOA of the current MA

5.9.6.3.1 In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On
Sight area.

5.9.6.3.2 When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches
either to Full Supervision, to Limited Supervision or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

Level Transitions

General requirements

Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2, 3 or NTC is
supported shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment via balise
group or via the RBC.

A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to
the border.

When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a_ level transition
announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on-board level,
it shall immediately inform the driver about the announced level transition.

Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on-board equipment may remain
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed.

At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level
transition order or a conditional level transition order.

Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional
level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation.
Also sleeping units read balise groups.

If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall
still be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the
announcement.

The on-board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time.
Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a
new order to switch to a different level or to the same level but at a different location is
received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order
shall be executed.

In Shunting and Passive Shunting modes only one set of Level Transition Information
shall be stored at a time. Therefore a set of Level Transition Information received shall
replace any Level Transition Information already stored on-board.

As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data
(mainly movement authority and track description data) from the transmission media of
the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is
effective.

Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS
chapter 4.8.

Note: if only track description has been received from the new media without any
movement authority, this track description still replaces the one previously received
from the current media when the transition is performed.

When the onboard has performed the level transition, further data (mainly movement
authority and track description data) received from the transmission media of the level
being left shall be rejected.

Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS
chapter 4.8.

Intentionally deleted.

Table of priority of trackside supported levels

Any combination of ERTMS/ETCS levels 0, NTC, 1, 2, and 3 on a given area shall be
possible.

The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional level transition
order at the border shall contain all the supported ERTMS/ETCS levels with a table of
priority. Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority.

Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels. This means that, for
example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS level 0, and is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS
level 1 and 2, the track-side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported
levels in all level transition orders and conditional level transition orders applying to that
area.

The table of priority shall list all the supported levels from the highest priority level to
the lowest one.

Intentionally deleted.

When receiving the information about all ERTMS/ETCS levels that are supported by
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall select from the table the level
with the highest priority, which is available for use by the onboard equipment.

The on-board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use”
as follows:

a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on-board and at least one Mobile Terminal is
available on-board, i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile
Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or
not.

b) Level NTC: the concerned National System is available on-board (if an STM is
used, refer to SUBSET-035 for further details).

c) Level 0 or 1: always.

Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment checks the
availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used)
is an implementation issue.

Examples: The table of trackside supported levels gives 2, NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1,
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board will select NTC X
level. If level 1, 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use’, it will select level 1. If level 2, 1
and 0 are “Available for use”, it will select level 2.

When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level
transition only.

If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment, it shall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the
lowest priority.

Justification: The On-board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the
driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall store the table of priority of trackside
supported ERTMS/ETCS levels.

When the level transition location is passed with the estimated front end a position
report shall be sent to the RBC. In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is
interfaced to the National System through an STM, please refer to SUBSET-035 for
the STM state transition order.

If an order to connect to an RBC has been received and the train will not enter the
announced RBC area, an order to disconnect shall be sent either from balises or from
the RBC for any route not leading to the RBC area. This is the case both if the train
turns back and if the train continues in the same direction, but on another route.

Transition from Level NTC to Level 1 area

A level 1 MA and track description information shall be received before or at the level
transition border. If not, when the level transition is performed, the train will be tripped,
i.e. after switching to level 1, movement is not allowed without a movement authority
(refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).

The driver is responsible for entering the level 1 area at a speed not exceeding the
speed limits of the Level NTC line.

In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is interfaced to the National System
through an STM, please refer to SUBSET-035 for the STM state transition orders in
relation to the level transition announcement and border.

Transition from Level 1 to Level NTC area

For the train to be able to enter the new area, the old area must possess information
about at least the first section of the new area. The information shall be transmitted to
the train either

a) as an MA and track description information into the new area, or
b) as a target speed at the border location i.e. as an LOA.

speed limits of the unequipped line.

5.10.3.14 Conditional level transition order

5.10.3.14.1 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment accepts a conditional level transition
order the onboard shall check whether the current level is contained in the priority list
of the conditional level transition order.

5.10.3.14.2 If the current level is contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition order,
the onboard shall not change the level.

5.10.3.14.3 If the current level is not contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition
order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the same way
as an immediate level transition order (see section 5.10.2).

5.10.3.14.4In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside.

5.10.3.14.5 Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in
a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold movement. The level of a
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the
current level operated by the train.

5.10.3.15 Transition initiated by driver

5.10.3.15.1 In addition to the level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possible, at standstill,
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2).

5.10.3.15.2 If the driver changes the level to 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
establish a communication session with the RBC:

a) immediately if at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network and a
valid RBC ID/ phone number is available, OR

b) once the driver has selected the Radio data (by the same means as for Start of
Mission), if either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or no valid
RBC ID/phone number is available.

5.10.3.15.2.1 Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC
contact information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in
PT mode.

5.10.3.15.3 If the driver changes the level from 2 or 3 to any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is
established. When receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the
communication session to be terminated.

5.10.3.15.4In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has reported having changed from
level 2/3 to any other and no order to terminate the session is received within a fixed

the order to terminate the session is received, or the defined number of repetitions
(see Appendix A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting
time after the last repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the
communication session.

5.10.4 Acknowledgement of the level transition
5.10.4.1 If defined so for the level transition (see table below), the driver shall be requested to
acknowledge the transition
a) when the max safe front end of the train has passed a trackside defined location in
rear of the level transition border
b) upon receipt of the order to switch to the new level immediately
5.10.4.1.1 Exception: An ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in NL mode shall not require an
acknowledgement from the driver.
5.10.4.1.2 Exception to 5.10.4.1.a): in SB mode, the driver shall be requested to acknowledge the
level transition only when the level changes.
5.10.4.2 _ If the driver has not yet acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1) after the level transition, a service brake command shall be initiated.

Degraded Situations

ERTMS/ETCS level 2 or 3: no acknowledge for PT mode is received from the RBC

In case a communication session is established and no reply is received from the RBC
within a fixed waiting time (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after
reporting the mode change, the report shall be repeated with the fixed waiting time
after each repetition.

After a defined number of repetitions(see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value
Data) and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the last sending of
the mode change report, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the
communication session.

Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has
not been taken into account for the design of the flowchart. However, should such a
fault occur in any step while ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in level 2/3 and in
PT mode, the driver shall have the possibility to select "Override" if the conditions
defined in 5.8.2.1 are fulfilled and the process shall go to the procedure "Override".

Change of Train Orientation

Introduction

The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD
position.

This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to
change the driving cab.

The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver
changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE.

The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post
Trip or in Reversing mode.

The driver uses the same engine (a mission is ongoing)

The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.

Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
immediately goes to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see
“End of Mission” procedure).

When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.

When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.

The driver leaves the engine to go to another one

The described situation is the following: The train has two engines (engine A and
engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave engine. Each
engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on-board equipment is in Sleeping mode.
Note: The mode is entered when on-board equipment detects the presence of the
"remote control" signal.

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading
engine but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment is
in Non leading mode.

c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on-board equipment
is in Passive Shunting mode.

Assumption: The train configuration does not change.

a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine.

b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will
be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL,
afterwards engine A will be in NL mode; If before the change of train orientation
engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode.

Case "Engine B was in SL mode"

The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of
engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission
(see “End of Mission” procedure)

As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment of engine B switches to Stand-By mode.

Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of engine B opens a communication
session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC.

When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure.
Case "Engine B was in NL mode"

The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches
to Non Leading mode.

Once the non leading input signal is not received any more, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment of engine B will switch to Stand-By mode (refer to SRS chapter 4,
transitions between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure).

Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment enters Stand-
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered.

Case "Engine B was in PS mode"

The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure". The
ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes
the desk of engine A.

The driver opens a desk in engine B, and ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to
Shunting mode.

The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is ongoing)

The situation is the following: while the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in
Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting
engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.

Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk
closure”. When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall immediately go to Passive Shunting mode.

When the driver opens the desk B, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch back to Shunting mode.

When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data.

Train Reversing

This procedure is intended to allow the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run
away from a danger up to a “safe” location.

The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).

While the train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be
informed that reversing is possible

If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver's intention to reverse (e.g. from a
direction controller in reverse position), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode.

If the driver acknowledges, the on-board equipment shall switch to RV mode

Once in RV mode, it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted
distance to run and a new maximum speed.

Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for
the new permitted distance to run.

Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside
that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

Joining / Splitting

Definitions

Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for being
split. The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train before splitting,
the “new train after splitting”, refers to the other part.

Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation.

Procedure “Splitting”

Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS).

Note: If splitting requires moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small
distance, this can be done even in SB mode

Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train
before splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the driver must
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting.
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 — Data Entry
/ Modification Process)

Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was
in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).
For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment opens a communication
session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC.

Step 2c - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5,
“end of mission” procedure).

The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the
“Start of Mission” procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility.
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible.

Procedure “Joining”

Step 1 - The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be
performed in SR, OS or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the
national procedure for joining).

Step 2 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be closed
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS).

Step 3a - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment remains leading and
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with
the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see
SRS chapter 3 — Data Entry / Modification Process)

Step 3b - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). Transition to SL
mode is from SB mode.

Step 3c - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions
between modes).

For further steps after joining refer to procedures “Start of Mission” and “Change of
Train Orientation”.

RBC/RBC Handover

Principles

Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC.

The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and
to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border.

In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, ERTMS/ETCS
trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the new Radio
Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio Network’s
configuration.

In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for
communication session with “Handing Over’ RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the
one used for communication session with “Accepting” RBC.

Note: In the following sections, Radio Networks are supposed to be overlapped.

At the RBC/RBC border a balise group with an order to execute the handover
immediately shall be placed.

Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted
independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups.

If the message from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall
still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location
according to the announcement information.

The on-board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC transition at a time,
therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order.

Procedure

Overview

In the normal operation, the main functional steps needed for running from one RBC
area to another one are the following:

a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over” RBC;

b) Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC;

c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

5.15.2.2 Step by step description
5.15.2.2.1 Pre-announcement

5.15.2.2.1.1_ When the “Handing Over RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition.

§.15.2.2.1.2 The “Handing Over RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC
handover.

5.15.2.2.2 Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC

5.15.2.2.2.1 A radio communication session with the Accepting RBC is opened by the on-board
equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over” RBC
or from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio
communication").

5.15.2.2.2.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, the registration to
the new radio network of the second Mobile Terminal is completed before the RBC
transition order is transmitted to the on-board equipment.

5.15.2.2.3 Generation of MAs including the border

5.15.2.2.3.1 The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the movement authority
based on:

a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the
part of route related information up to the border),

b) Information from the “Accepting RBC” for the part of route related information in
advance of the border.

5.15.2.2.4 Announcement

5.15.2.2.4.1_ When the train reaches the border with its max safe front end, the ERTMS/ETCS
on-board equipment sends a position report both to the “Handing Over” RBC and to
the “Accepting” RBC.

5.15.2.2.4.2 The “Handing Over’ RBC forwards the announcement information to the
“Accepting” RBC.

5.15.2.2.4.2.1 Note: The forwarding of the announcement information is executed because the
“Handing Over” RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in
a degraded situation or not i.e. whether it can handle one or two communication
sessions.

5.15.2.2.5 Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC

5.15.2.2.5.1 As soon as the on-board has sent to the “Accepting” RBC the position report, it
considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC i.e. it uses information received
from the “Accepting” RBC.

5.15.2.2.5.2 When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on-board and detects
that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and

5.15.3.2.4.1_ As requested by the RBC transition order, when the min safe rear end of the train
passes the location of the border, the on-board equipment sends a position report to
the “Handing Over” RBC.

5.15.3.2.4.2 When this position report is received by the “Handing Over” RBC, it sends an order
to terminate the session to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

5.15.3.2.5 Registration to the new Radio Network of the Mobile Terminal (optional) &
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC

5.15.3.2.5.1. When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives the session termination
order from the “Handing Over RBC, it terminates the session with the “Handing over”
RBC and opens a session with the “Accepting” RBC (refer to chapter 3, management
of radio communication).

5.15.3.2.5.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change: as soon as the
session with the "Handing Over" RBC is terminated, the registration to the new Radio
Network of the Mobile Terminal is enforced by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
prior to the opening of a session with the “Accepting” RBC (refer to chapter 3,

Note: If the “Handing Over” RBC is not able to extend the MA into the area of the
“Accepting RBC”, the driver may select "override", or manually change the level to
move the train into the area of the “Accepting RBC”.

Note: If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment cannot open a session with the
“Accepting RBC’, the train is stopped at the latest when it has reached the EOA given
by the “Handing Over” RBC. For passing the EOA the driver may select "override", or
manually change the level.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not able to terminate the session with the
“Handing Over” RBC: In case a communication session is established and no request
to terminate the session is received from the “Handing Over” RBC within a fixed
waiting time (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value Data) after sending the
position report (see 5.15.2.2.6), the position report shall be repeated with the fixed
waiting time after each repetition.

After a defined number of repetitions (see appendix to chapter 3, List of Fixed Value
Data), and if no reply is received within the fixed waiting time from the last sending of
the position report, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall terminate the
communication session.

Procedure passing a non protected Level Crossing

General Requirements

In case the LX is not protected, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (in FS, LS or
OS mode) shall temporarily supervise the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL
(instead of the EOA/LOA and the SvL (if any) derived from the MA), with no release
speed.

The supervision of the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL shall be substituted
by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP under conditions depending
on whether stopping in rear of the LX start location is required or not. The conditions of
this substitution are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3.

The start location of the LX speed restriction depends on the substitution conditions,
which are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3. The end location of the LX speed restriction
shall be the LX end location.

When approaching a non protected LX, the on-board equipment shall inform the driver
about the status of the LX, as soon as:

a) either the EOA or the SvL related to the LX start location becomes the Most
Relevant Displayed Target (see 3.13.10.4.2), or

b) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment substitutes the supervision of the LX start
location as both the EOA and SvL by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the
MRSP.

5.16.1.5 Indication given to the driver shall remain displayed until one of the following conditions
is met:

a) information “LX is protected” is received on-board;

b) train has passed the LX end location with its min safe front end.

5.16.2.1 Once the train has stopped with its estimated front end inside the stopping area, given
by trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall no longer supervise the LX
start location as both the EOA and SvL (i.e. the EOA/LOA and the SvL (if any) derived
from the MA shall be again supervised) and shall immediately include the LX speed
restriction in the MRSP, starting from the estimated train front end.

5.17      Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver

5.17.1       Introduction

5.17.1.1.. When valid Train Data is stored on-board, input information acquired from
ERTMS/ETCS external sources different from the driver may affect some of the Train
Data, depending on the type of train (e.g. tilting input information from tilting external
device may affect the train category and the loading gauge).

Passing a non stopping area

This procedure is dealing with the announcement and indication to the driver of an
area where stopping is not permitted.

As long as there are non stopping areas stored on-board, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board
equipment shall continuously check the current speed and position of the train whether
a full service brake command would stop the train within any of the stored non
stopping areas. This shall be achieved taking into account for each non stopping area,
two virtual SBI supervision limits (SBlp and SBlg), calculated at the estimated speed
from two SBD curves of which the feet are the start location of the non stopping area
(point D) and a location (point G) at train length distance in advance of the end location
of the non stopping area:

a) If the max safe front end is in rear of the first SBI supervision limit (SBlp) no
information related to this non stopping area shall be displayed

b) If the max safe front end is in advance of the first SBI supervision limit (SBlp) and
the min safe front end in rear of the second SBI supervision limit (SBlg), the non
stopping area related information shall be displayed to the driver according to the
following clauses 5.18.4.3, 5.18.4.4.

c) If the min safe front end is in advance of the second SBI supervision limit (SBle), no
information related to this non stopping area shall be displayed.

When the max safe front end is in rear of the start location (point D) of the non
stopping area, the “Non stopping area announcement” shall be displayed to the driver.

When the max safe front end is in advance of the start location (point D) of the non
stopping area:

Procedure Limited Supervision

General Requirements

The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode
profile.

An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below.

Limited Supervision is requested for current location (from modes
different from Stand By and Post Trip)

In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise
(group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and
receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately
switch to Limited Supervision mode.

In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode
profile giving a Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its
max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode.

The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver.

If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to
Appendix A.3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command
is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for
another reason(s).

Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited
Supervision mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because
a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff
Responsible mode) then an emergency brake command could be immediately
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the LS
supervision (see Figure 22).

Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or On Sight mode
by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = LS mode speed limit) at the
location of transition to Limited Supervision mode.

If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in LS mode when receiving the LS
mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver.

Limited Supervision is requested for a further location
The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not
reached yet. This occurs when:

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision
area that is located at a further location.

b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision
area that is located at a further location.

A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following
conditions are fulfilled:

a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of
Limited Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.

b) The speed is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national value,
or value given in the mode profile).

c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision
Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.

Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train
accelerates).

Limited Supervision from Unfitted or SN mode

The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN
mode). A transition to Limited Supervision mode can therefore earliest occur at a
transition of level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3.

Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.19.2 shall apply.

Limited Supervision from Stand By or Post Trip mode

When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3,
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited
Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this
case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement
from the driver.

When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform
the transition to Limited Supervision mode.

Exit of Limited Supervision mode

General rule

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall exit the Limited Supervision mode when
the min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.

First case: The Limited supervision area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA

This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode
Profile has the same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA.

In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the
Limited Supervision area.

Second case: The Limited Supervision area ends before the EOA/LOA of the
current MA

In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Limited
Supervision area.

When exiting the Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS
chapter 4, transitions between modes).

Generation of Track Conditions related information to an
ERTMS/ETCS external function

Introduction

This set of procedures specifies the information generated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment to an ERTMS/ETCS external function in relation to the following
track-conditions:

a) powerless section with pantograph to be lowered,

b) powerless section with main power switch to be switched off,

Cc) passing an “air tightness” area,

d) inhibition of a defined type of brake,

e) change of traction system,

f) change of allowed current consumption,

g) station platform.

In the following sections, the remaining distance from the concerned train end to the
concerned track condition location shall be counted positive when the train end is in

rear of the location and shall be counted negative when the train end is in advance of
the location.

Passing a powerless section with pantograph to be lowered

This procedure is dealing with the generation of the information related to a powerless
section with the pantograph to be lowered.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the generation of the information to
the ERTMS/ETCS external function when the max safe front end of the train reaches
the point C in rear of the start location of the powerless section (see 5.18.2.2.1 for the
definition of point C).

When the min safe rear end of the train is in rear of the start location (point D) of the
powerless section, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall provide the following
information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function:

e the remaining distance from the max safe front end of the train to the start location
(point D) of the powerless section

e the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to the end location
(point E) of the powerless section

When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the start location (point D) of the
powerless section, the remaining distance from the max safe front end of the train to
point D shall no longer be generated. The remaining distance from the min safe front

When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the end location (point E) of the
powerless section, the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to
point E shall no longer be generated.

Note: The remaining distance from the train max safe front end to point D and the
remaining distance from the train min safe front end to point E are generated until the
min safe rear end passes respectively the point D and the point E to allow the
ERTMS/ETCS external function to manage each pantograph individually assuming that
this function knows the distance between each pantograph and the train front end.

lowered, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment considers the new end location (point
E) of the powerless section for the calculation of the remaining distance from the min
safe front end of the train to the point E.

If resuming the initial state (see 3.7.3.2) or any other reason (e.g. see Appendix A.3.4)
leads to the deletion of the powerless section, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall stop providing information related to this powerless section to the ERTMS/ETCS
external function.

Passing a powerless section with main power switch to be switched off

This procedure is dealing with the generation of the information related to a powerless
section with main power switch to be switched off.

information related to this change of allowed current consumption to the ERTMS/ETCS
external function.

Station platform

This procedure is dealing with the generation of the information related to a station
platform.

The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the generation of the information to
the ERTMS/ETCS external function when the max safe front end of the train reaches a
location (point C) in rear of the start location of the station platform (point D).

This location (point C) shall be determined by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
taking into account the time necessary for performing the required actions and the
current train speed.

When the min safe rear end of the train is in rear of the start location (point D) of the
station platform, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall provide the following
information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function:

e the remaining distance from the max safe front end of the train to the start location
(point D) of the station platform

e the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to the end location
(point E) of the station platform

e the nominal height of platform above rail level (refer to TSI infrastructure)

e the position of the station platform (left side, right side, both sides) in reference to
the train orientation

When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the start location (point D) of the
station platform, the remaining distance from the max safe front end of the train to
point D shall no longer be generated. The remaining distance from the min safe front
end of the train to the end location (point E) of the station platform as well as its
nominal height above the rail level and its position shall continue to be generated.

When the min safe rear end of the train reaches the end location (point E) of the
station platform, the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to point
E, the position of the station platform and its nominal height above the rail level shall
no longer be generated.

Note: The remaining distance from the train max safe front end to point D and the
remaining distance from the train min safe front end to point E are generated until the
min safe rear end passes respectively the point D and the point E to allow the

Appendix A.3.4) leads to the shortening of a station platform, the ERTMS/ETCS on-
board equipment considers the new end location (point E) of the station platform for
the calculation of the remaining distance from the min safe front end of the train to the
point E.

5.20.8.9 If resuming the initial state (see 3.7.3.2) or any other reason (e.g. see Appendix A.3.4)
leads to the deletion of the station platform, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment
shall stop providing information related to this station platform to the ERTMS/ETCS

6.3.1.1     The chapter defines the composition of envelope of legally operated system versions,
i.e. all the ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate
and that on-board equipment shall support.

6.3.1.2     By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters are applicable regardless of
the system version operated (see SUBSET-104 § 6.1.3.2); this chapter includes the
exceptions to those clauses and the additional clauses, which apply when the system
version of some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a
version number older than the last one introduced.

Trackside requirements in relation to older system versions

Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1

Introduction

The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this release
of the SRS.

Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it shall
be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0, and 1.1

Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use for balises the following values of M_VERSION: 2.0
and 2.1.

Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area
support the system version number X = 2 and the on-board requirements related to the
trackside information marked with 2.0 or 2.1 are applicable regardless of the operated
version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter operates with
the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC).

Exceptions to chapter 3
Intentionally deleted.
Section 3.6.2.4 shall not apply.

Clause 3.7.1.1 b) shall be replaced with: “When needed, limitations related to the
movement authority, i.e. Mode profile for On Sight or Shunting and signalling related
speed restriction (see sections 3.12.4 and 3.11.6). Mode profile and Signalling related
Speed restriction shall always be sent together with the MA to which the information
belongs”

In clause 3.7.1.1 c), the bullet “Optionally Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted
braking distance (see section 3.11. 11)” shall not apply.

In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “LX speed restrictions” shall not apply.

In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “Inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises in L2/3 (from
RBC only)” shall not apply.

Clause 3.9.3.2 shall be replaced with: “The orders shall be sent via balise groups.”
Clause 3.9.3.8.1 shall not apply.

Clause 3.11.3.2.2 c) shall not apply.

engineering to ensure that for all possible combinations of international train categories
a train might belong to, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment will not replace the

On-board requirements in relation to older system versions

Introduction

This section covers the following situations:

a) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X
=1

b) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X
= 2, but still transmitting some balise/loop/RIU information related to system version
number X = 1 (see section 6.5.2)

c) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X
= 2, but on-board equipment has established a communication session with a
neighbouring RBC certified to system version number X = 1

d) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X
= 1 or 2 and the on-board equipment has established a communication session with
a RBC/RIU certified to system version number X.Y = 2.0

Specific requirements for on-board operating with system version number
X=1
Exceptions to chapter 3

Clause 3.12.3.4.7.2 shall be replaced with: “If the driver acknowledges before the end
condition is fulfilled, the on-board equipment shall consider the driver
acknowledgement as always ending the text display, regardless of the end condition
defined in 3.12.3.4.3.1”.

Exceptions to chapter 4

Clause 4.4.11.1.3 d) shall be replaced with: “balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in
SR’. This order shall immediately trip the train.”

Condition [54] in table 4.6.3 shall be replaced with: “(reception of information “stop if in
Staff Responsible”) AND (override is not active)’.

Exceptions to chapter 5

For information received from trackside, the message consistency check shall be
achieved taking into account the exceptions to chapters 7 and 8, as described in
sections 6.5.1.5 and 6.5.1.6.

For information received from trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall
use the translation tables defined here below, in order to use the information as if it had
been elaborated in compliance with the current chapters 7 and 8.

Packets received from balise, loop, RIU, RBC

In the table below, the translation of information may depend on the on-board operated
system version at the time the information is received and accepted on-board.

When a level transition or an RBC/RBC handover is announced, the information stored
on-board in the transition buffer shall be translated according to system version
operated on-board at the time the information is released from the transition buffer (i.e.
the system version operated by the trackside infrastructure, towards which the train is
running).

Depending on the packet, the action can be:
a) data is unchanged,

b) data is rejected,

c) data is translated,

d) not relevant

R= Rejected T= Translated       U = Unchanged     NR = Not relevant

Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language

Introduction

The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise
and loop airgaps.

The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages
are described in chapter 8).

Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally,
depending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior
verification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details.

Definition of Variables

Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor
units. The whole variable has one type (meaning).

Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the
variable.

Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.g. 32767 = “unknown’).
Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range

Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as
described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different
names.

All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are
used, if used in more than one media.

Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement.
One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true.

Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where
justified.

When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall
be transmitted first.

All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

Definition of Packets

Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal

structure.

This structure consists of a packet header with:

e Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the
orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows:

Number           NID_PACKET
Direction                      Q_DIR
Length                         L_PACKET
Scale                        Q_SCALE
Information su.

Packet identifier

Specifies the validity direction
of transmitted data

Number of bits in the packet

Specifies which distance scale
is used for all distance
information within the packet.

There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.

Well defined set(s) of variables.

e Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables.

The packet structure is as follows:

Number           NID_PACKET
Length                         L_PACKET
Scale                        Q_SCALE

Packet identifier
Number of bits in the packet

Specifies which distance scale
is used for all distance
information within the packet.

There is no Q_SCALE variable
in packets which do not contain
distance information.

Information su.                                 Well defined set(s) of variables.

The packet definition does not change when transmitted over different transmission
media.

All currently not defined packet identifiers are reserved for future use and shall be
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values) when received by the on-board
equipment. Exception: reception of information only differing by Y with regards to the
highest system version number X supported by on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11).

Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram”
do not follow the above defined structure.

N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or group of variables which
follow.

If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow.
Two nested levels of iterations can exist.

If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a variable is
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition

Row “Transmitted by” in the description of a packet specifies which ERTMS/ETCS
trackside device (balise, loop, RIU, RBC) can transmit this packet. “Any” means that
the packet can be transmitted by a balise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU.

Row “Transmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which ERTMS/ETCS
trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

Packet Number 1: Position Report based on two balise groups

Description            This packet is an extension of the “standard position report “ packet 0. It is used
in case of single balise groups if the orientation of the LRBG is unknown but the
on-board equipment is able to report a second balise group (the one detected
before) to give a direction reference for the directional information in the
position report.

B1, D2 > C4, ....etc) and it is used by the on-board equipment to compare its axle load category with the
axle load category sent by trackside.

For the underlying meaning of the axle load categories listed below (with the exception of HS17) refer to
CR INF TSI.

The category HS17 (axle load <= 17t) corresponds to a static load per axle only, as specified in HS RST
TSI clause 4.2.3.2. The introduction of this artefact is necessary to ensure backward compatibility,
without any negative performance impact, in case ASPs are used on lines operated with system version
X=1.

Introduction

Scope and Purpose

This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS
functions.

Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such
as medium-specific use constraints (e.g. distance between track-circuit and balise...),
as well as functions (e.g. detection of balise reference, time and location stamp,
identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio
connection...) and performance of the transmission media.

Definitions

Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop).

A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the
transmission medium).

A Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram
from balise number 1 first), each telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A
Eurobalise telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of
Packets.

8.4          Rules

8.4.1       Common Rules

8.4.1.1      A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) is composed of
1. One Header,
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio),
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio),
4. Optional Packets as needed by application.

8.4.1.2     The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message
format (from top to bottom).

8.4.1.3     The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given
by the message.

8.4.1.3.1 Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such
packet.

8.4.1.3.2 Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of balise group
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of
LRBG (radio transmission).

8.4.1.4    A track-to-train message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type
for the same direction.

8.4.1.4.1 Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).

8.4.1.4.2 Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed
Restriction). In case of revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary
speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be
different.

8.4.1.4.3 Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The
identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR)
transmitted in the same message shall be different.

8.4.1.4.4 Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is
to be considered as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a
balise group shall have identical content per direction.

Exception 5: A message can contain several packets 88 (Level Crossing information).
The identities of the corresponding Level Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in
the same message shall be different.

Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254
(default balise, loop or RIU information).

Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 145
(Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction).

Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0
(Virtual Balise Cover marker).

Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6
(Virtual Balise Cover order). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C)
of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different.

A train-to-track message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type.

Exception: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system).

Note: For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4, when the same packet is transmitted by
duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within
the message. Justification: The on-board equipment will only use one of these
duplicated telegrams (and therefore only one set of duplicated packets) to compose
the balise group message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2).

8.4.4       Rules for Euroradio messages

8.4.4.1     The message identifier is unique (variable NID_MESSAGE).

8.4.4.1.1 All currently not defined message identifiers are reserved for future use and shall be
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values) when received by the on-board
equipment. Exception: reception of information only differing by Y with regards to the
highest system version number X supported by on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11
b)).

8.4.4.2    Each message shall indicate its own length through the use of the variable
L_MESSAGE.

8.4.4.2.1 If the computed length of the message is not equal to the length given by
L_MESSAGE, the entire message shall be rejected.

8.4.4.3      The messages shall be composed of predefined variables and packets.

8.4.4.4    For some messages, it shall be possible to add optional packets at the end of the
message.

8.4.4.4.1

The track to train messages possibly including optional packets are listed hereafter:

Track to Train message              Mess. ID

8.5.1       Introduction

8.5.1.1     This section identifies the radio messages with corresponding Message Identifier
(Mes. Id.”) and Message Name. It also gives a list of the version-invariant messages.

8.5.1.2    “Type” defines whether a message is to be sent as normal priority (N) or as high
priority data (E), as defined in Euroradio specifications.

9.3          Introduction

9.3.1       Scope and Purpose

9.3.1.1      Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of
the SRS.

9.3.1.2   The purpose of this chapter is to ease the assessment of the compliance of an
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment with the SRS.

9.3.1.3  To that effect, this chapter comprehensively identifies which clauses contain
requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and conversely
which ones do not, either because they contain requirements allocated to the
ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or because they are of another type.

9.3.2          Definitions

9.3.2.1      The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause:
a) ERTMS/ETCS on-board requirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS on-board
b) ERTMS/ETCS trackside requirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS trackside, in case the
corresponding function is implemented

c) Definition: a clause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of
requirement(s) or without which requirement(s) cannot be unambiguously
interpreted

d) Informative: a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the
justification of requirement(s)

e) Others: a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories

9.3.2.2    Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword
“shall”. However:
a) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on
the accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMS/ETCS on-
board and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”.

b) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables,
see chapters 7 and 8) are also described with tables. The numbered titles (i.e. the
name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated
table are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS on-
board and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword “shall”
either.

9.3.2.3    Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined, in
case a requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and
ERTMS/ETCS trackside or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on-board and
trackside requirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability
reasons.
