EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Passenger traffic has significantly increased over the last few decades, straining existing
technologies and making further capacity increases through traditional methods unfeasible. Current
signalling systems have reached their limits. However, new alternatives that align with European
objectives — such as creating a high-capacity, integrated railway network by removing interoperability
barriers, providing full integration solutions, and speeding up innovation — offer a way forward.
ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), is one of the
implementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context of FP2 R2DATO, WP37 aims at
developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the implementation of HTD. In this
deliverable, we set the requirements specification for the simulations that will be performed by FP1
WP8/9. To this end, we provide a methodology for defining the requirements specification to FP1
WP8/9. In particular, we define performance indicators related to capacity and robustness, where
capacity is assessed in simulations without external delays and robustness in simulations with
external delays (compared to the undelayed simulations).

This deliverable addresses the basis of the urgent need for railway signalling innovative solutions to
enhance railway capacity and efficiency. Many passengers are affected by these constraints, and
the consequences of not addressing these issues could severely impact the reliability and
sustainability of Europe's transportation network. This report seeks case studies in various European
countries to bridge existing gaps and foster consensus on the future direction of railway signalling
technology deployment, particularly focusing on ETCS HTD, which offers a balanced solution that
combines the benefits of modern train control technologies with the practicality and cost-
effectiveness of using existing infrastructure. This makes it an attractive option for rail operators
looking to enhance their systems without incurring the high costs and complexities associated with
full-scale replacements or upgrades.

Existing literature and prior research highlighted the potential benefits and initial successes of
HL3/HTD. However, significant gaps remains, particularly in real-world applicability and performance
under varied conditions. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of
ERTMS/ETCS, followed by the investigation of various case studies and variables pertaining to the
HTD design. These variables are the size of the Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks, the size of
the Virtual Sub Sections (VSS) and the share or types of trains equipped with Train Integrity
Monitoring (TIM). The scope encompasses various scenarios across fifteen rail lines and networks
in Europe, namely Spain, France, Sweden and the Netherlands. The case studies vary in terms of
infrastructure, traffic, general assumptions and scenarios. In particular, the level of complexity can
be different depending on the investigated set of performance indicators and scenarios, as well as
on the market segment. The investigated market segments include high-speed, mainline, regional,
(sub)urban and freight railways. By collaborating with key stakeholders and industry experts, these
specifications will be simulated on CAF tool (for the Spanish cases) and RailSys tool (for the Dutch,
Swedish and French cases) to model and analyse different performance indicators under various
scenarios, including traffic and infrastructure conditions.

The added value of this deliverable is to check based on these requirements specification in which
design configurations, scenarios, market segments and cases HTD can be mostly beneficial. This
would allow to find the scenarios that would significantly reduce headways, allowing for more trains
to operate safely on the same tracks, thus addressing congestion issues effectively. The findings
from these test specifications will underscore the EU's added value in standardising and supporting
advanced rail technologies, promoting a more integrated and efficient European rail network.

While this deliverable marks a significant basis and milestone for futher developments towards
deploying HL3/HTD, further research and innovation are necessary to fully realise the potential of
implementing this railway signalling technology. This deliverable is the foundation for additional
studies focusing on long-term impacts, cost-benefit or multi-criteria analyses, standardisation,
roadmapping and deployment strategies. Future works within FP2 WP37 will include the
development of the methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks and determining ETCS
HL3 capacity impact analysis based on the FP1 WP8/9 simulations. In addition, next steps will
involve evaluating the market acceptance, with a focus on harmonising standards and regulations to
facilitate widespread adoption. Continuous advancements in technology and simulation models for
various market segments and cases in Europe will be cruciall in refining the system and ensuring its
readiness for broader implementation.

2 INTRODUCTION

Throughout Europe, passenger traffic has significantly increased over the last few decades, which
has led to a limitation of the existing technologies to meet future projected demand. Existing
signalling systems have been exploited to such an extent that capacity increase by means of
conventional methods is no longer possible. However, new alternatives that fit the overall European
objectives (e.g., to deliver a high-capacity integrated European railway network by eliminating
barriers to interoperability, providing solutions for full integration, and achieving faster uptake and
deployment of innovation) represent a step ahead to tackle the abovementioned limitation:
Digitalisation and automation solutions for rail operation (e.g., Automatic Train Operation (ATO) up
to Grade of Automation (GoA)4, ETCS Hybrid Train Detection and Moving Block and Advanced Safe
Train Positioning (ASTP) among others).

Deliverable D37.3 belongs to FP2 WP37 ‘ETCS HL3 Deployment Strategies’ that aims at developing
migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of ETCS Hybrid Level 3, currently
known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), which consequently reap the benefits as quickly as possible
and avoids costly investments in new infrastructure as much as possible.

2.1 RELATIONS WITH OTHER FLAGSHIPS, WORK PACKAGES AND DELIVERABLES IN
Europe's RAIL

D37.3 relates to FP2 WP15 ‘Hybrid Level 3 Specification’ whose main objective is to align and
integrate the HTD approach into the future Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the
System Pillar and to apply the defined principles to different kinds of railways. D37.3 also relates to
publicly available documents on ETCS HL3 specifications published by the ERTMS Users Group
(EUG).

This deliverable is a main input to FP1 WP8 ‘Development - Simulation and operational feedback for
improved planning’ and FP1 WP9 ‘Demonstration - Simulation and operational feedback for
improved planning’. FP1 WP8/9 will perform the capacity simulations that align with the requirements
specification defined in this deliverable. D37.3 also has dependencies with D37.1 ‘Standardisation
and deployment’ since the requirements specification are crucial when defining standardisation and
deployment. In addition, it relates to D37.2 ‘Methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks’
since based on the input that will be received from FP1 WP8/9, the method for optimising the design
of blocks will be defined. In a further step, the results from D37.2 and from the capacity studies in
FP1 WP8/9 will be used as input for D37.4 ‘Determining ETCS HL3 capacity impact analysis using
simulations’.

2.2 OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE

The main objective of this deliverable is to describe the requirements specification for the capacity
simulation studies. In particular, this deliverable aims at providing the performance indicators and
scenarios to be included in FP1 WP8 and calculated in FP1 WP9 in order to find the right method
for applying HTD in several environments and for various market segments. These work packages
will perform research on the railway capacity and the number of trains that can be handled, given
several infrastructure designs, timetables and technologies installed on the infrastructure side and

train side of the railway system. The description of the scenarios therefore focuses on finding the
different methods for infrastructure design from a railway capacity perspective. This deliverable sets
the basis for these work packages, that will also perform part of the research on the robustness of
the railway system for disturbances. This will be done with only deterministic delays. Stochastic
delays are excluded here, because of the lack of good input data (there are no comparable HTD
systems in operation). In addition, the reproduction of a scenario in a stochastic environment and
the comparison of the results is more difficult (due to the different propagation of knock-on delays
based on input delays).

This deliverable focuses on the simulation specifications that will be sent to EU Rail FP1 WP8/9 for
calculation and simulation. The analysis of the results of WP8/9 will be performed in Deliverables
D37.2 and D37.4 and will there lead to conclusions on block layouts and optimal deployment
strategies.

3 ERTMS/ETCS OVERVIEW

The European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS), as introduced in the newly published
Technical Specification for Interoperability (CCS TSI 2023/1695), is being implemented all around
Europe to ensure interoperability. ERTMS includes the European Train Control System (ETCS) for
automatic train protection, the first baseline of ATO up to GoA2, the Global System for Mobile
Communications for Railways (GSM-R) and FRCMS. Improving the safety of national and
international train traffic, bringing benefit in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the entire
Control Command and Signalling system (CCS), by reducing trackside assets, and increasing
capacity are among the most relevant advantages of ERTMS.

Depending on the application level, ETCS trackside and on-board subsystems are characterized by
specific equipment on both the track and the train, their interaction, and their functions. The ETCS
levels establish different uses of ERTMS as a train control system [1]:

e ETCS Level 1: track-to-train spot communications, where a significant and costly amount of
trackside elements are required to control the movement of the train. Train detection and
train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling
system.

e ETCS Level 2: continuous communications between the train and the track, which enable a
reduction in OPEX and CAPEX and increase line capacity. Train detection and train
separation can be performed by the Radio Block Centre (in cooperation with the train which
sends position reports and train integrity information) and/or by other trackside equipment.

ETCS Level 2 is therefore a crucial player in the search for delivering better capacity, reducing costs,
improving flexibility, and increasing reliability of the railway network since dependency on trackside
equipment is minimized.

ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD) based on the ERTMS
Users Group [2], is one of the ETCS L2 implementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context
of R2DATO, WP37 aims at developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the
implementation of HTD.

HTD is a concept that uses pre-configured fixed virtual blocks for the separation of trains. The virtual
blocks can be used by trains that are able to send integrity confirmation in the position report, while
trackside train detection is still used for the separation of trains which are not able to send integrity
confirmation. The trackside train detection is also used for the handling of degraded situations. The
main advantage of HTD is the reduction of trackside implementation cost (extending current
Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks), an improved capacity performance (by introducing shorter
blocks), or a combination of both.

3.1 ETCS HYBRID LEVEL 3/HYBRID TRAIN DETECTION OBJECTIVE

The ERTMS Users Group [2] discuss how ETCS HL3/HTD aims at increasing line capacity and
optimizing the use of existing infrastructure. HTD improves train detection and safety by combining
track-side and on-board systems. In addition, HTD facilitates a smooth transition from conventional
systems and ensures compatibility. Therefore, the main goal of HTD is to improve railway system
capacity, safety, and efficiency while reducing costs and enhancing operational flexibility.

3.2 ETCS HYBRID LEVEL 3 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND FUNCTIONALITY

The reference architecture for HTD is the current ERTMS architecture defined in the TSI (omitting
some ETCS level 1 features), as shown in Figure 1 [3].

Key Management
Systems

Regarding this architecture and the associated functionality of HTD, the following considerations are
made:

In general, the trains without ETCS but with the National System can be managed in HTD as "ghost
trains” (detected by the TTD but not reporting its location to the trackside). These features are subject
to specific application analyses, as the behaviour of the National System is not harmonised.

The HTD-ready trains are generally expected to be equipped at least with a system providing the
train integrity information to the EVC (OTI-I) and optionally a system providing the safe train length
(OTI-L). Integrated devices providing more than one information are possible. Trains equipped with
ETCS but without OTI-I can be allowed in HTD, but treated as non-integer trains, still having the

HTD performance however giving to the following train a performance analogue to ERTMS Level 2
with only TTD.

The functionality of the system relies in the Hybrid Train Detection Concept. This concept is based
on the following essential components/functionalities:

e Positive Train Detection (PTD): PTD relies on information received from the train itself. It
uses position reports sent by the train, including data such as position, integrity status, and
safe train length. When a train reports “integrity confirmed,” it becomes an “integer train”. The
trackside can use this information to determine the train’s location and manage train
movements. PTD allows for reduced trackside infrastructure since it does not rely solely on
physical sensors (such as track circuits or axle counters).

e Trackside Train Detection (TTD): TTD is the conventional method of train detection using
physical sensors installed along the track (e.g., track circuits or axle counters). In the HTD
system, the TTD sections are subdivided into smaller units called Virtual Sub-Sections
(VSSs). Each VSS corresponds to a portion of the TTD section and has its own occupation
status (free, occupied, ambiguous or unknown). TTD information can confirm whether a train
is or not physically present on a VSS.

e Virtual Sub-Sections (VSS): VSSs are the building blocks of the HTD system. They allow for
finer granularity in train separation. Each VSS can be in one of four states (based on trackside
information):

o Free: No train is located on the VSS.

o Occupied: An integer train is present on the VSS, and no other vehicle is behind it.

o Ambiguous: A train is present, but there might be another non-connected vehicle
behind it.

o Unknown: No train is confirmed on the VSS, but its status is uncertain.

VSS states are dynamically updated by means of a VSS state machine, which is operated
based mainly on position reports, TTD information, the status of the HTD timers and
Movement Authority (MA) information.

e Train Location: The concept of “train location” defines the trackside view of the portion of
track currently occupied by a connected train. The front end of the train location is determined
by the train’s max safe front end position and train detection information. According to the
EUG document on the HTD Principles (published on 16 July 2024), the front end of the train
location is not depending on the integrity status. The train integrity is based on the rear end
of the train location which is "established" for a train treated as integer or "assumed" for a
train which is not treated as an integer [2]. Therefore, the rear end of the train location is
either “established rear end” (for integer trains) or “assumed rear end” (for non-integer trains).

e HTD timers: For handling degraded situations, there are two types of timers defined within
the HTD concept:

o Waiting timers: they are aimed to avoid unnecessary changes in the state of a VSS
due to the asynchronicity of train position, train integrity and TTD information. They
are:

= Mute timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider after a
defined time that the communication with that train is lost;

= Wait integrity timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider
after a defined time that the integrity of that train is lost when no integrity
information is available;

=urope’s Rail

= Shadow train timer: used to prevent wrongful detection of shadow trains
(ghost trains chasing normal HTD operated trains).

o Propagation timers: they are implemented in the trackside to avoid unnecessary
propagation of the state “unknown” to VSS sections for which there is no immediate
risk that a rail vehicle could be located on them. They are:

= disconnect propagation timer: used at the trackside for each track section to
consider after a defined time that an “unknown” track section should be
propagated after train disconnection;

= ghost train propagation timer: used to prevent the risk of undetected ghost
trains;

« integrity loss propagation timer: used at the trackside for each track section to
consider after a defined time that an “unknown” track section should be
propagated after integrity loss.

The introduction of VSS in general does not change the principles of route setting and handling of
MAs since VSSs are treated in the same way as sections with TTD. HTD is an enhanced train
detection concept too allow an optiomal use of PTD and TTD train detection systems. HTD can be
used in train centric or geographical safety sytems and with conventional signalling systems. The
HTD can be used with the existing legacy rules and interfaces. To give an example, it is possible
that the RBC today takes as a necessary but not sufficient condition to send an MA in Full
Supervision that status “free” of a TTD. With the implementation of HTD, the same RBC is expected
to use instead as input condition the status “free” of one or more VSSs belonging to the same TTD.

4 METHODOLOGY

This chapter presents the methodology used for defining the requirements specification to FP1
WP#8/9. In particular, in section 4.1 we present the performance indicators for the capacity simulation
studies. In 4.2 we define the set-up of scenarios and variables, followed by the description of the
simulation environments CAF tool and RailSys in 4.3.

4.1 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

There are several performance indicators to be assessed after executing the simulations. Together,
these performance indicators will provide a complete overview of the effects of ERTMS HL3/HTD
regarding capacity. These relate to the general terms of capacity and robustness. The capacity will
be assessed in simulations without external delays and the robustness in simulations with external
delays (compared to the undelayed simulation). Both require different performance indicators that
are elaborated in Table 1 and Table 2.

The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios without external delays are explained in
Table 1.

The scenarios of the Swedish southern mainline and the Dutch SAAL corridor will be assessed
further for the aspect of robustness by letting a train block the other traffic for a set number of
minutes. This gives the insight in how quickly the block layout given a particular traffic pattern helps
to solve the congestion. The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios with external
delays are explained in Table 2.

4.2 SET-UP OF SCENARIOS AND VARIABLES

This section describes how the scenarios have been set-up to achieve the aim of this deliverable.
Note that there are several benefits of HTD that will not be the focus of this deliverable. Only research
related to capacity and robustness will be the focus of these case studies as stated in Section 4.1.
For capacity, the headway between two following trains will be computed or the relative capacity
utilisation of a full timetable will be calculated. For robustness calculations, some scenarios will be
set up in which a train blocks the corridor for a set time period, where the aim is to study the recovery
time, number of affected trains and total delay.

Simulation with stochastic disruptions will not be included in this stage, for several reasons. The
input data of real disruptions is not available for future or hypothetical situations analysis, scenarios
are harder to reproduce or compare and finally this method requires many runs which makes
simulation and analysis more time consuming. Overcoming these issues does not outweigh the
benefits, so stochastic analysis is not foreseen in this deliverable. Therefore, all simulations will be
deterministic with no delays or fixed delays in the simulation.

In every scenario, we define a reference situation, using the current or future base information about
the track and calculating the headway or relative capacity utilisation. After that, and through
variations of the physical blocks and incorporating virtual blocks, according to what is proposed in
each scenario, improvement in capacity will be sought in these cases where the capacity is the main
objective. When the objective is cost reduction and only keeping equal capacity, we look for keeping
the current headway but changing the physical blocks into VSSs.

These results are used not only in this work package in tasks T37.3 and 137.5, but also in FP2
WP32.

Each case study described in Chapter 5 includes four parts:

e Infrastructure: a description of the part of the railway network used in the case studies, either
the current infrastructure for existing lines or the planned infrastructure for a greenfield situation.

e Traffic: a description of the train services on the delimited network and possible alterations that
could influence the scenario. The described traffic could be either current traffic (high flows

where HTD could help increase robustness), or future traffic flows demands that could only
possibly be achieved with HTD.

e Assumptions: this section describes additional assumptions for the simulations, like timetable
principles.

e Scenarios: a description of the different infrastructure and traffic scenarios. They always relate
to reference scenario and then build up in order to make the results comparable with only one
variable changed at a time. The variables are described below.

For our simulation studies of HTD there are three variables of interest: the lengths of the TTD blocks,
the lengths of the VSSs and the availability of TIMs on trains. These variables are defined for each
scenario and depend on the state and aim of each network.

e Size of the TTD blocks [m]: A benefit with HTD is the possibility to extend the current TTDs
without affecting capacity negatively. This means that for some scenarios varying the size of
TTD is of interest.

e Size of the VSS [m]: For creating additional capacity with additional blocks it is not necessary

anymore to add axle counters or loops, but it can be done with adding VSSs. Therefore the
size of VSSs is crucial for the capacity computation.

e Share of trains equipped with TIM [% or based on train type]: The availability of TIM equipped
trains in the traffic pattern has impact on the capacity and robustness. This might be a
percentage of the trains or defined as one train category to have a TIM and another to not have
a TIM.

4.3 SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS

Two simulation environments will be used in EU Rail FP1 WP9 for assessing the case studies of this
work package: the tool of CAF for exploratory research based on the headway of two trains for the
Spanish case studies and RailSys for the French, Swedish and Dutch case studies that involve a
complete timetable and in some cases external delays. Both simulation environments are briefly
described in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.

4.3.1 CAF tool

The simulations for the Spanish cases will be performed in the CAF tool. It is focussed on calculating
headways. Therefore the tool needs information about the rolling stock and about the technical and
the physical characteristics of the track. The tool is limited to work with two trains at the same time:
the predecessor and its follower. According to this information, it offers the headway between them
as a solution.

4.3.2 RailSys

The simulation software RailSys is an integrated microscopic planning tool, developed by RMCon.
RailSys is widely used in the railway sector by infrastructure managers, railway undertakings
consulting firms and research institutes [4]. RailSys features native ERTMS/ETCS support and

R2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03                Page 19 of 60                                  20/12/2024

detailed calculations of the ETCS braking curves. Infrastructure and rolling stock are modelled on a
microscopic level, which provides sufficiently detailed settings for the modelling of HTD and
analytical possibilities for the results.

Infrastructure models are needed for all scenarios which utilise RailSys. In case of current lines,
existing models will be used as a basis of the studies. For some scenarios, ERTMS/ETCS will need
to be implemented in the models. HTD needs to be designed and applied to all existing models for
the relevant scenarios. It is important that relevant settings are correctly used to achieve a credible
simulation result. Coordination between partners is necessary for this purpose.

For the evaluation of capacity utilisation, the UIC-406 compression method in RailSys will be used.
In RailSys, the interpretation of UIC-406 is based on the compression of sequential timetable train
paths within divided sections [4]. According to the method, RailSys identifies conflicts in the timetable
and moves affected trains exactly unhindered behind the conflicting train. The outcome from the
RailSys computation is the capacity utilisation which will be generated from specific case studies as
described in Chapter 5.

5 CASE STUDIES AND SCENARIOS

To fulfill the aims of developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of
ETCS HTD, the several research scenarios have been defined according to the set-up described in
the previous chapter. These scenarios are used for evaluating the requirements specification of HTD.
The lines have been chosen where the main advantages of HTD can be found, both in terms of
reduction of trackside implementation costs and improvement of capacity performance.

The general outline is that the Spanish cases and a Swedish case will be described and analysed
based on headways. Thereafter, the French and Swedish cases will be assessed on capacity by
relative capacity utilisation. Finally another Swedish case and the Dutch case are desribed and
analysed for relative capacity utilisation and robustness aspects.

Since there are many case studies described in this chapter, Table 3 provides an overview of the
locations, market segments, network length, reference signalling system and performance
indicators. The explanation follows in the paragraphs of every separate case study.

5.1 SPAIN: ATOCHA COMMUTER TUNNELS

5.1.1 Infrastructure

This is a double-track ETCS Level 1 section for commuter trains between Chamartin and Atocha
stations, with a length of 7.4 km, this section is selected for study as it is a central node where many
lines come together, more specifically, almost all of Madrid's commuter lines.

There are two options for this route: through Recoletos tunnel stopping at Recoletos station
(Chamartin-Nuevos Ministerios-Recoletos-Atocha) or through Sol tunnel stopping at Sol station
(Chamartin-Nuevos Ministerios-Sol-Atocha). Figure 2 displays the schematic of the lines involved.

At Nuevos Ministerios station, there are sidings on each track so that different speed trains can
overtake each other if necessary.

The technical drawing of the track layout is shown in Figure 3.

5.1.2 Traffic

The traffic of the line consists of commuter trains every 7 minutes on both Recoletos and Sol routes,
regional trains every 45 minutes through Recoletos and every 3 hours through Sol. The timetable for
the Atocha commuter lines can be found in [6]. The maximum speed of the trains is 90 km/h.

5.1.3 General assumptions
All the trains are equipped with TIMs in the reference scenario.

TIMs conditions are changed for the rest of the simulations as explained in the following section.

5.1.4 Scenarios

For the scenarios to be simulated in this section, two objectives are pursued. On the one hand, the
aim is to achieve an increase in capacity; on the other hand, the aim is to reduce costs. Considering
the following described conditions, the goal is to find a balance between both, cost and capacity.

In order to achieve these objectives, different scenarios are proposed to check, by simulation, if,
firstly, the defined goals are achieved and, secondly, if the results are valid.

First, the reference scenario is defined, which is the current track and traffic status, and will be used
to compare the rest of the scenarios to be simulated. In this way, we will obtain an answer on whether
we have improved the defined goals regarding the current state.

These scenarios are determined by modifying different elements: making changes in the
infrastructure (TTD), modifying the integrity of the rolling stock and incorporating VSSs.

Since the objectives to be achieved for this line are both capacity improvement and cost reduction,
the chosen scenarios are the following:

In relation to traffic and rolling stock, two alternative conditions are defined: the first is that it is
assumed that commuter trains are equipped with TIMs, whereas regional trains are not equipped
with it (Scenarios 1 and 2 in Table 4). The second condition is to consider that all the trains are
equipped with TIMs (Scenarios 3 and 4 Table 4). This way, differences regarding capacity between
those cases can be compared, where it could be visualized whether a decrease in capacity is
obtained as a result when not having TIMs equipped.

Regarding TTDs, in the first scenario, the current TTD layout remains with no change. As mentioned,
the cost reduction goal is also pursued, therefore, a case where TTDs are reduced between stations
to the minimum is defined. By reducing the number of physical TTDs, a cost reduction could be
obtained as a result of not installing them when designing a track.

However, if we only reduce the TTDs, this could be reflected in a decrease in capacity, hence, VSSs
are incorporated. For the length of these, a methodology for optimal VSS lengths for each specific
line should be followed.

However, in the absence of such methodology, it is intended to make an engineering study of the
line, where the most critical sections of the track will be identified and analyzed. Firstly, a maximum
VSS length (taking into account the TTD maximum size) is implemented, then, a simulation is runned
and a new VSS size decreased by multiples of 25 is simulated. Several iterations are performed

R2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03                 Page 25 of 60                                   20/12/2024

through simulations until a size is reached (minimum VSS length of 25 meters [2]) from where the
results improve in a non-significant way concerning the objective of the defined scenario, cost
reduction and capacity increase for this case, so the optimal length is established. The proposed

scenarios for the Spanish Atocha Commuter Tunnels are shown in 1

5.2 SPAIN: MADRID C-5 CERCANIAS

5.2.1 Infrastructure

This is a double-track commuter line between Mostoles-El Soto and Humanes with 21 stations in
between them, with a length of 45.1 km. The used signalling system is Class B.

This line is selected for study as it is the only one in Spain working with automatic driving, where it
is expected to eliminate this LZB and install ERTMS.

Figure 4 represents the scheme of the line where all the 21 stations appear. A fully technical
description of this line is available at [7].

5.2.2 Traffic

Unlike the rest of the commuter network, the C-5 line has similar frequencies to the Madrid Metro
lines.

The traffic consists of commuter trains every 5 minutes during peak hours and every 10 minutes
during off-peak hours.

This is the only case study where there is a differentiation between peak and off-peak hours
regarding train frequency.

The maximum speed of the trains is 155 km/h.

5.2.3 General assumptions

Stations are closer to each other than the rest of the Madrid commuter lines and it has a particular
signalling and supervision system, the LZB, a train protection system with continuous transmission
of information and monitoring of the vehicle speed.

All the trains are equipped with TIMs in the reference scenario.

=urope’s Rail

TIMs conditions are changed for other experiments as explained in Section 5.2.4.

5.2.4 Scenarios

The objectives of this scenario are also cost reduction and capacity increase, where different
infrastructure, rolling stock and VSS conditions are defined.

Regarding rolling stock, it is defined a case where all the trains are equipped with TIMs and another
case where trains are not equipped with TIMs. This way, we could compare the two situations in
terms of capacity.

Concerning trackside conditions and in order to get a cost reduction, a condition where TTDs are
reduced between stations with no change in stations is defined while another condition is defined
where the current TTD layout is maintained.

In the case of VSSs, once the knowledge acquired in the Atocha commuter tunnels study for
determining the most critical sections can be applied while using the previously mentioned
methodology for determining the optimal VSS size for each case, several simulating iterations
starting from the minimum possible VSS length will be carried out. The proposed scenarios for the
Spanish Cercanias C-5 case are displayed in Table 5.

5.4 SPAIN: BARCELONA - FIGUERAS

5.4.1 Infrastructure

This is a double-track high-speed line between Barcelona and Figueras with a length of 130 km. It
is equipped with ETCS L2. A full description of this line is available at [8]. The stations are the
following: Barcelonna-Sants, Sant Andreu Comtal, Mollet, Llinars, Riells, Vilobi d’Onyar, Girona,
Figueres.

5.4.2 Traffic

The traffic of the line consists of mixed traffic: freight trains every 1.5 hours, regional trains (200-250
km/h) every 2 hours and high-speed trains (250-350 km/h) every 3 hours.

5.4.3 General assumptions

Current trains are equipped with TIMs. For the simulations, passenger trains remain equipped with
it and freight trains will not.

5.4.4 Scenarios

The objective to reach by this simulating experiment is to get an increase in capacity. This is a
mainline with high-speed and freight traffic between Madrid and Torrején de Velasco.

Concerning rolling stock, passenger trains will remain all equipped with TIMs as it is more critical
because of punctuality and other possible service problems. Freight trains will not be equipped with
TIMs because it is deemed less critical than for passenger trains, primarily due to punctuality
concerns and their associated impacts.

The TTDs remain as they are now in the reference scenario. However, VSSs are incorporated in
order to get an increase in capacity. The VSS lengths will be the ones taken from the methodology
for reaching optimal sizes through iterations by simulating this specific scenario taking into account
the critical sections and the increase in capacity objective. The proposed scenarios for the Spanish
case Barcelona-Figueras are displayed in Table 7.

Contract No. HE - 101102001                    CE

=urope’s Rail

The traffic of the line consists of regional trains every 1.5 hours from Asuncion Universidad,12
commuter trains per day and 2 long distance trains per day towards Bilbao (out of the study).

The maximum speed of the trains is 70 km/h.

5.5.3 General

assumptions

Passenger trains are all equipped with TIMs whereas freight trains are not.

5.5.4 Scenarios

The main objective for this line is to reduce costs, hence, conditions for rolling stock, TTD and VSS

are determined.

Regarding TTDs, there is a situation in which one TTD remains between stations and one TTD in
stations is defined.

The strategy for the VSS length is the same as in the scenarios of the previous case studies, to use
the developed methodology for reaching the optimal size from the cost reduction point of view once
an engineering study for this concrete line has been done. The proposed scenarios for Le6n-Guardo

are shown in Tab

5.6 SPAIN: LERIDA-REUS

5.6.1 Infrastructure

This is a single regional line with ETCS L2 from Lérida to Reus covering a length of 64 km. The study
covers the following stations: Lleida Pirineus, Puigverd de Lleida, Juneda, Les Borges Blanques,
Canal d’Urgell, Vinaixa, Riu Milans, L’Espluga de Francoli, Montblanc, Vilaverd, La Plana-
Picamoixons, Base de Alcover, Alcover and Reus.

5.6.2 Traffic

The traffic consists of mainly freight trains and 2 passenger trains per day, therefore it is considered
as freight case study. These freight trains could typically be organized in batteries of trains that all
the group runs towards the same direction in order to increase capacity.

The maximum speed of the trains is 140 km/h.

5.6.3 General assumptions

All the trains are equipped with TIMs as in the current reference scenario.

5.6.4 Scenarios

The objective set for this line is to improve capacity, for which rolling stock, TTD and VSS conditions
are defined.

The TTDs remain as they are now in the reference scenario, however, VSSs are incorporated in
order to get an increase in capacity. The VSS lengths will be the ones taken from the methodolgy
for reaching optimal sizes through iterations by simulations. Table 9 displays the proposed scenarios
for Lérida-Reus.

For the rolling stock, a case where passenger trains are equipped with TIMs and freight trains are
not is defined and another case where both passengers and freight trains will be equipped with TIMs
is also defined. The TTDs remain as they are now in the reference scenario, however, VSSs are

5.8 FRANCE: LILLE

5.8.1 Infrastructure

This case study consists of a project for the development of the regional lines around Lille. The
project is planned to be completed in 2040, and includes both capacity improvements of existing
infrastructure and a new double-track line (Hénin-Beaumont - Lille) for high-speed regional trains.
The new line is planned to be equipped with ETCS.

5.8.2 Traffic

The traffic of the network includes regional and suburban trains. The aim of the project is to increase
traffic on all routes to/from Lille, doubling the frequencies to four trains per hour. The new Hénin-
Beaumont - Lille line has a target of 12 trains per hour in each direction. It is planned to have only
suburban and regional trains on the new line that will be studied. The time-distance diagram for the
Lille case study is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: REHF traffic diagram, with up to 12 trains per hour, only suburban or regional
trains (red and orange trains)

5.8.3 General assumptions

All trains running on the “Réseau Express Hauts-de-France, REHF”, will be equipped with TIMs for
the ETCS HTD scenarios.

There is currently no scheme plan that shows the division of the ETCS block sections for the line.
Therefore, asumptions will be made for the division of ETCS block sections (around 1.5 km for ETCS
L2 and less for ETCS HTD (length to be determined).

5.8.4 Scenarios

The aim in this case study is to determine the capacity effect of ETCS HTD compared to ETCS
level 2 on the new double track line (Lille Euraflandres — Henin Beaumont). Because all trains in
the network are regional and suburban, it can be assumed that all trains will either not have TIMs

5.9 FRANCE: BRETAGNE PAYS DE LoIRE (LNOBPL)

5.9.1 Infrastructure

The LNOBPL is a new proposed high-speed line in France. The aim of the project is to improve the
rail connection between Brittany and Pays de la Loire. Several infrastructure improvements are
proposed, including a new high-speed line, capacity treatment of critical sections of the existing
infrastructure, and implementation of ERTMS/ETCS on the existing lines. Implementing HTD on new
lines or on an existing line is seen as an option.

As the new high-speed line will not have a high capacity requirement, the study will focus on the
existing line that are planned to be equiped with ETCS. These lines have high capacity requirement
as they support mixed trafic (regional, suburban, high-speed and freight trains) The exact relevant
lines of the network where the study will be carried out are still to be determined.

5.9.2 Traffic

The aim the project is to improve the frequency of the suburban, inter-regional , and high-speed links
to/from Paris by increasing rail capacity and improving journey times, while supporting the
development of rail freight. The traffic is mixed with high-speed train, regional trains, suburban trains
and freight trains running on the sames tracks. The planned timetable for the line Rennes — Brest is
shown in Figure 9.

5.9.3 General assumptions

All suburban and regional trains running on the network will be equipped with TIMs for the ETCS
HTD scenarios.

All freight trains running on the network will not be equipped with TIMs for the ETCS HTD scenarios.
Two scenarios for the ETCS HTD will be studied for the high-speed trains :

e 1% scenario: High-speed trains equipped with TIMs.
e 2" scenario: High-speed trains not equipped with TIMs.

There is currently no scheme plan that shows the division of the ETCS block sections for the Britany
and Pays de la Loire network. Therefore, asumptions will be made for the division of ETCS block
sections (around 1.5 km for ETCS L2 and less for ETCS HTD (length to be determined)).

5.9.4 Scenarios

The interest of this case study is to determine the capacity effect of ETCS HTD compared to ETCS
level 2, as displayed in Table 12, where different scenarios will be compared with trains equiped or
not with TIMs.

For the reference scenario, no trains will be equipped with TIMs (only ETCS L2).

For ETCS HTD, we will model a scenario with only the regional/suburban trains equiped wih TIMs
and a scenario with either the regional/suburban trains and the high-speed trains equiped with TIMs.

For all scenarios, freight trains will not be equipped with TIMs. The proposed scenarios for the
LNOBPL French case are displayed in Table 12.

5.10 SWEDEN: STOCKHOLM CITYBANAN

5.10.1          Infrastructure

A 6 km long commuter line through the city centre of Stockholm. The line is doubletrack with two
stations on the line (Stockholm City and Stockholm Odenplan), both with platforms on the main track.
No shunting is allowed at Stockholm City or Stockholm Odenplan. The tunnel is deep which means
that there are high gradients at the start and end of the line, which affects the braking curves
depending on down- or uphill. Gradients could also limit the possibility of VSS deployments, as it
should be possible to stop and accelerate at each VSS. The current line uses track circuit for TTD.
However, there are plans to change the TTDs to axle counters. The timeline is not confirmed. For
the simulation of the line, the length of model should be longer than the 6 km. This is because the
traffic on the connected lines will limit the possible capacity on Citybanan. The infrastructure layouts
of the Stockholm Citybanan case are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11.

Figure 11: Zoomed-in version of Citybanan Infrastructure

5.10.2         Traffic

Traffic on the Citybanan consists of only commuter trains. The capacity consumption is high, with
392 trains/day (data from Trafikverket 2023), see Figure 12. It is also likely that there will be a need
to increase the traffic in the future.

Dwell time at Stockholm City is limited to 2 min during peak traffic, and 1 min at Stockholm Odenplan.
Trains also need to time the stops with platform screen doors, which can lead to extended dwell
times. In some cases, trains need to reverse to align with the screen doors. Adding strain to the
timetable, increasing the need for increasing the capacity, which HTD can help to alleviate.

Figure 12: 2024 timetable of Citybanan [4]

5.10.3         General assumptions

For the simulations, it is assumed that all other traffic (non-commuter trains) at lines connecting to
Citybanan are non-integer.

Traffic is assumed to be the same as the current timetable.

5.10.4         Scenarios

As the line has high capacity utilisation today, the performance indicator headway and the UIC-406
compression method are relevant for this case. Capacity is a prioritising criterion on this line as it is
already at its limits. Robustness could be of interest. However, as trains travel on a much larger
network than Citybanan, the simulated network would need to be extended. Therefore, a simulation
of the extended network would be too complex for analysing capacity. The benchmark, i.e. signalling

system used as a starting point, should be ETCS L2, as the line is planned to be upgraded to

ERTMS.

The specific scenarios have been chosen depending on shares of trains integrated with train
integrity. Because all the trains occupying the line have the same train types, it can be assumed that
there will be a migration phase (where some of the train have train integrity), followed by the entire
fleet being upgraded with train integrity. The specific value of VSS should be selected with the aim
of decreasing the headway. The Citybanan trains are already tightly packed, so the VSS should be
as short as possible. The document ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Train Detection: Principles [2] mentions
25 meters as an example of minimum length. However, if there are restrictions with the simulation
tool (e.g., run time of the simulation), a VSS length of up to 100 meters can be accepted. We
therefore propose the infrastructure and traffic scenarios as presented in Table 13.

Table 13: Proposed scenarios for Swedish Citybanan case

5.11 SWEDEN: East LINK

5.11.1          Infrastructure

A greenfield railway project with aim of increasing capacity between Stockholm and Linkdping.
Connecting to the Western Main Line at the north and to the Southern Main Line in the south. The
goal of the project is for the line to become operational in 2035. The planning process is currently
ongoing, and the line is planned to be doubletrack with ERTMS/ETCS Level 2. The line will have five
new stations (Vagnharad, Nyképing, Skavsta, Norrképing and Linképing) and is planned to allow
train speeds of 250 km/h. The line is part of a future high-speed line in Sweden, connecting
Stockholm and Gothenburg/Malmé6. Between Norrképing-Link6ping, the line will run parallel with the
current Southern Main Line (see Figure 13).

As the line is a greenfield project, it is of interest to study various lengths of VSS. Only trains running
at high speeds will operate on the line, so all trains are assumed to have TIMs. The proposed
scenarios for the East Link are shown in Table 14.

5.12 SWEDEN: SOUTHERN MAINLINE (NORRKOPING — MJOLBY)

5.12.1          Infrastructure

The section Norrképing—MVjélby is part of the Southern Mainline between Stockholm and Malmé6, one
of the most important railway connection in Sweden. The section between Norrképing—Mjélby is
about 79 km long, double track and electrified. The Southern Mainline infrastructure is illustrated in
Figure 14. The allowed speed on the section is between 110-200 km/h. The section consists of
seven stations, where two stations (Linghem and Kimstad) have platforms on the main track and no
possibility for overtaking.

5.12.3         General assumptions

Traffic is assumed to be the same as the current timetable.

5.12.4         Scenarios

Performance indicators of specific interest for the Southern Mainline are headway, the UIC-406
compression method and recovery time. The reason is that capacity and robustness are important
aspects of this line, as the capacity utilization is high, and the line is prone to disturbances. The
signalling system ETCS L2 is used as benchmark, as there is an ongoing project to implement
ERTMS on the line.

The traffic scenarios have been chosen from the assumption that different train types will be
upgraded with train integrity in steps, from easy implementation to complex. For this reason, it is
assumed that railcars will have working train integrity in a first step, followed by locomotive-hauled
passenger, and lastly freight trains. The value for VSS lengths in this case study should be from the
assumption of a simple deployment strategy. Meaning, that the VSS lengths have a standardized
length. This is mainly because of two reasons: firstly, it simplifies the simulations in this first step of
studying the deployment strategies; secondly, studying the effect of a standardized length could be
of interest as it would save cost for the HTD deployment project. A standardized VSS length, in this
step, should be in the range of 200 — 500 meters. The reason for this is that similar values have been
used in earlier studies [12].

The total number of scenarios to be simulated for the Swedish Southern mainline is 16 (four train
integrity scenarios per infrastructure scenario). The scenarios for the implementation of virtual blocks
and the extension of current blocks are reported in Table 16.

5.13 THE NETHERLANDS: SAAL-CORRIDOR (SCHIPHOL AIRPORT, AMSTERDAM,
ALMERE, LELYSTAD)

The SAAL-corridor is one of the busiest railway lines in the Netherlands on which a capacity increase
is planned by implementing ETCS L2. From Schiphol airport, the line runs to the intercity station of
Amsterdam Zuid, then via Weesp to Almere and ends in Lelystad. The line contains multiple
locations where traffic merges and diverges to other corridors.

In this section, we describe the infrastructure scenarios and traffic scenarios for the SAAL corridor.
Next, we elaborate on several assumptions that are relevant for the Netherlands. Finally, we describe
which simulations are to be executed.

5.13.1          Infrastructure

The infrastructure consists of several parts of 4-track. These sections lie between Hoofddorp,
Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid and around Weesp. Furthermore, the stations of Rai, Weesp, Almere
Centrum, Almere Oostvaarders and Lelystad Centrum provide more than 2 platform tracks. The rest
of the line is all double track.

The reference infrastructure scenario is the base infrastructure on which a Level 2 design from the
real project is assigned according to design version 2.0 of February 2024. We will vary two
infrastructure design parameters in order to find the ideal design principle under various conditions
of usage.propose 7 different infrastructure scenarios, based on variations around two parameters to
find the proper design principles for various usage of the:

1. Number of axle counters
2. Distance of virtual blocks

3. Based on these two parameters we have created seven infrastructure design scenarios that
will be described below.

The number of TTD blocks can be varied in 3 gradations:

1. The base infrastructure on which a Level 2 design from the real project according to design
version 2.0 of February 2024. This is infra scenario I-0.

2. The first HTD design, numbered I-1, is based on the base L2 design of Il-0 and assumes a
headway of approximately 1 minute without buffer times still reachable on the TTD for
degraded situations and behind trains without TIM. This leads to a reduction of 50 % axle
counters as a result of the following assumptions:

e Physical blocks of ~ 2 km on tracks without regular freight traffic, given passenger
trains running at 140 km/h

e Physical blocks of 0,5 — 1 km on tracks with regular freight traffic, given freight trains
running at 100 km/h

e Some shorter physical blocks near stations
e No additional virtual blocks
3. The second HTD-design, numbered I-4, is the base infrastructure with only a minimum
number of axle counters, always near other physical objects (switches and level crossings).

This leads in the worst case to trains running only at station distance in degraded situations
or behind trains without TIM.

The distance of virtual blocks can be varied in 2 gradations:

The base infrastructure from scenario I-1 or I-4 with additional virtual blocks to further

optimise capacity. The virtual blocks are 200-250 meters apart (usually by splitting the
designed TTD-blocks in 2 VSS). This fits to a headway of approximately the timetable
resolution of 6 s for the shortest and fastest trains. These scenarios get the numbers I-2 and

1-5.

The infrastructure from scenarios I-2 and I-5 with additional virtual blocks to further optimise

capacity. The virtual blocks are 100-125 meters apart. This fits to a headway of approximately
half the timetable resolution of 3 s for the shortest and fastest trains. These scenarios get the

numbers I-3

and I-6.

This leads to the total of 7 infrastructure scenarios, numbered I-0 to I-6, as shown in Table 18.

In order to find a bal

ance between work

load and the demand for simulations we propose to simulate

all scenarios in which the distance between virtual blocks are varied only on the “Flevo” line between
Muiderberg Aansluiting and Lelystad (note that the Flevo Line is the northeastern part of the SAAL
area). This leads to infra scenarios I-1 and I-4 having a version on the whole scope of SAAL and on
the scope of only the Flevo line. These infra scenarios are marked with S and F respectively. The

reference I-0 is only analysed for the whole SAAL area and the infra scenarios |-2, I-3, I-5 and I-6
are only analysed for the smaller Flevo area.

Direct comparison is possible between infra scenarios in every column [I-0, I-1S and I-4S], [I-1S and
|-4S], [I-1F and |-4F], [I-2 and 1-5] and [I-3 and I-6] and in every row [I-1F, I-2 and I-3] and [I-4F, 1-5
and I-6], where within each group the geographical area is the same and is only varied in one layout
setting, either the number of axle counters or the number of virtual blocks. The design of the Flevo
Line for the infrastructure scenarios I-0 and I-1 are displayed in Figure 15 and Figure 16, respectively.

5.13.2         Traffic

The SAAL-corridor contains high density mixed traffic of intercities and regional trains in an hour-
pattern, including two international paths and two freight paths. In Figure 17, the line plan is
described. Between Schiphol and Lelystad, and between Schiphol and Hilversum, an intercity
service runs every 15 minutes. Furthermore, there are 6 Sprinters an hour between Almere and
Amsterdam Centraal, 4 Sprinters between Hilversum and Amsterdam Centraal and 2 Sprinters
between Hilversum and Almere. Finally, 4 Sprinter trains run from Amsterdam Zuid to Lelystad that
do not stop at local stations between Weesp and Lelystad.

Freight paths are also part of this corridor and run twice every hour between Amsterdam Bijlmer and
Hilversum. International paths are part of regular intercity traffic on this corridor. One of the four
intercities to Lelystad runs from Brussels, and one of the intercities to Amersfoort continues to Berlin.
In this study, these trains are considered as regular national intercities.

The intercities run in a strict 15-minute interval, while all other trains are evenly divided in this interval.
This leads to multiple short headways. Between Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid a train runs every
2.5 - 3 minutes without exception. The most restricting part of the OV-SAAL network is between
Weesp and Almere. This time-distance diagram is visualized in Figure 18, in which the intercities are
shown in blue. The local trains from Amsterdam Zuid run non-stop between Weesp and Almere.
Together with all Sprinters, the structure is described from Weesp to Almere as follows: Intercity,
local train from Amsterdam Centraal, local train from Amsterdam Zuid, local train from Amsterdam
Centraal or Hilversum, Intercity. Almost all headways on Weesp and Almere are planned at 2.5
minutes.

5.13.3         General assumptions

There are several assumptions specific for the Dutch network that are described in this section. All
of these are used to increase the applicability for the Dutch system.

The rolling stocks we use for passenger trains are ICNG-13 (Intercity Nieuwe Generatie) for all
intercities in Flevoland and Hilversum, and SNG-10 (Sprinter Nieuwe Generatie) for all local trains
and express trains.

Running time supplements are applied in the timetable, and therefore need to be incorporated in the
simulation as well. The running time supplement is described as a percentage of the technical
running time. The OV-SAAL timetable uses 7% for all intercities, and 6% for all local trains and
express trains.

A buffer time of 60 seconds is applied to all passenger trains. This practically means that every
section is occupied 60 seconds after a train has left that specific section. We use this method on all
scenarios. This value is used in order to have an additional buffer between two trains in the timetable
for the purpose of robustness, when they have to occupy the same infrastructure shortly behind each
other.

The freight paths we consider run from Kijfhoek, through Weesp to Amersfoort and further, in both
directions. These trains have a length of 720 metres, carry 2400 tonnes and are propelled by one
BR189. Freight trains do not run with a running time supplement and do not use a buffer time.

We consider two types of dwell time. The first is the dwell time at small stations. On these, local
trains will dwell for 30 seconds and intercities dwell for 54 seconds. Those are the technical minimum
dwell time based both on realisation data and proces analysis of the dwell procedure. On larger
stations, a larger value is used based on both realisation data and robustness measures. We use a
list made by ProRail that includes all intercity stations and differs for Sprinters and Intercities.

5.13.4         Scenarios

We propose 7 timetable scenarios numbered with “T-” to assess the impact on capacity and
robustness. The scenarios outlined in Table 19 are based on the areas to simulate specified in Table
18. Scenarios T-1 and T-3 are analysed for both the SAAL corridor and the Flevo Line, whereas T-
2 is analysed exclusively for SAAL. Scenarios T-4, T-5, T-6, and T-7 are analysed solely for the
Flevo Line. The combination of the infrastructure scenarios and timetable scenarios lead to 31
combinations as depicted in Table 19. In all timetable scenarios except for T-3 the assumption is
that all regular passenger trains have a TIM.

T-1            All 7                           Regular timetable without freight trains
T-2        1-0, 1-1S, |-4S           Regular timetable including freight train paths numbered

AB10 and KBG10

T-3         All 7                     Sprinters that do not include a TIM. We choose Sprinters
instead of intercities because Sprinters are more
constricting in the timetable

6 CONCLUSIONS

The goal of this deliverable is to describe the test specification requirements for ERTMS/ETCS
Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), also known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), to be considered in EU Rail FP1
WP8 and of which the capacity and robustness effects according to the specified performance
indicators will be calculated in EU Rail FP1 WP9. The methodology, case studies and scenarios
have been reviewed by partners from EU Rail FP1 WP8, that are now making preparations to
execute the required scenarios for WP9.

The scenarios are provided for seven Spanish case studies, two case studies in France, three in
Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The Spanish cases cover all five market segments: high-speed,
mainline (mixed traffic), (sub-)urban, regional and freight. They are exploratory of the headway
performance indicator. The insights can be used further in the French, Swedish and Dutch cases,
that cover the high-speed, mainline (mixed traffic) and (sub-)urban market segments. They use also
relative capacity utilisation as a measure in order to evaluate the capacity from a line and network
perspective. Finally, two cases from Sweden (Southern mainline) and the Netherlands (SAAL-
corridor) will be used to evaluate HTD-designs for their robustness by adding a deterministic delay
to a single train. This is measured by the performance indicators: recovery time, number of affected
trains and total delay in the system.

The scenarios are built specifically around logical combinations of infrastructure and traffic. In the
infrastructure, the variance lies in the number and positioning of trackside train detection and the
virtual subsections in between. In the traffic the variance is possible in the share and types of trains
that are equipped to fully utilise HTD by having a Train Integrity Monitor on board.

The results of the calculations of EU Rail FP1 WP9 will be used in the development and evaluation
of the method for track layout with ETCS HTD, that will be described in deliverable 37.2 of this work
package. Another evaluation of the results will be performed in EU Rail FP2 WP32, where different
DATO-concepts are compared.
