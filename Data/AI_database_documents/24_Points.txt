--- Document Chunk 5 ---
This is the latest in the IRSE’s “Back to basics” series of 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
articles, aimed particularly at helping people preparing 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
to take the Certificate in Railway Control Engineering 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
Fundamentals (Module A) of the IRSE’s Exam, and 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
those who are new to the industry or the profession of 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
railway signalling.

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
This article is about points and is in two parts. Part 2 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
will follow in IRSE News March 2022. Points have been 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
mentioned previously in the Back-to-Basics series but 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
have not been covered in any detail until now. There 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
are seemingly endless varieties of points and point 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
operating mechanisms around the world, and it is not 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
possible to cover them all. Instead, we will focus on the 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
principles and common practices, with some examples. 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
Terminology varies considerably as well; we will use the 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
term ‘points; throughout, but points are also referred to 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
as ‘switches and crossings’ (S&C) and ‘turnouts’. 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
One of the joys of S&T engineering is that it embraces a broad 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
range of engineering skills. Many articles in IRSE News explore 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
high-tech topics such as software, IP networks, cyber security 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
and artificial intelligence. At the other end of the spectrum lies 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
the mechanical engineering of points, with the signal engineer 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
quite literally involved in the nuts, bolts and grease of keeping 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
points operational. You can be an S&T engineer at either end 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
of this spectrum, or somewhere in the middle – and a few 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
even manage to be knowledgeable about all of it!

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
What are points and why do  

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
railways need them?

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
As soon as a railway becomes more than a simple piece of 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
track connecting A and B, requiring junctions to connect 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
with other lines or sidings, then points are a necessity. They 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
comprise fixed and moveable rails that guide a train from one 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
track to another. 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
Roads have junctions as well, of course, but self-evidently 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
there are no moveable parts, and it is worth briefly considering 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
why railways are not the same. Firstly, road vehicles can steer 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
themselves whereas trains cannot, and they therefore require 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
something to guide them in the intended direction. Secondly, 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
the wheels of road vehicles sit on the road surface, with no 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
part of the wheel below surface level. The wheels of railway 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
vehicles have flanges, which is the part of the wheel which 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
runs on the inside of the tracks and serves, in extremis, to 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
prevent the vehicles derailing – see Figure 1.

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
For these reasons, points have moveable sections of rail, both 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
to provide a continuous railhead for the train to travel in the 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
intended direction, and to provide gaps in the rails where 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
required so that the flanges can pass through.

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
On most railways, the points trackwork is the responsibility 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
of the track (permanent way) engineer, and the signal 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
engineer is responsible for providing and controlling (via 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
the signalling system) the means of moving the points, and 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
for ensuring that the points are in the required position 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
before a train is permitted to pass over them. This division of 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
responsibility is not universally true, however, and in some 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
railway administrations the roles and responsibilities are 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
allocated differently.

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
Points are used to enable trains to diverge from the ‘straight’ 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
route ahead, onto another line, or to stay on the straight route. 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
When trains traverse a set of points in this manner, they are 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
said to be travelling over the points in the ‘facing’ direction. 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
Points can also be used in the opposite direction, of course, 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
where two lines converge and become one. Trains using 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
points in this manner are said to be travelling over them in the 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
‘trailing’ direction – see Figure 2. Many points are used for both 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
facing and trailing movements.

--- Document Chunk 70 ---

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
The basic design of points

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
Before going much further, we need to understand the 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
principal parts of a set of points. The main components are 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
shown in Figure 3. Again, terminology varies somewhat, both 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
from one country to another and depending upon whether 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
you are a track engineer or a signal engineer. So please excuse 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
us if we use terminology with which you are not familiar or 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
even which you consider to be incorrect! 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
Various terms are also used to describe the position of points. 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
In Britain, and in some other countries, when the points 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
are set for straight route they are said to be in the ‘normal’ 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
position, and when they are set for the diverging route, they 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
are in the ‘reverse’ position. This terminology dates from the 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
days of mechanical lever signal boxes, when a lever was said 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
to be in its normal position when it had not been pulled, and 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
in its reverse position when it had been pulled. Alternative 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
terminologies for normal and reverse, which are used in other 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
parts of the world, include left/right, positive/negative and 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
direct/diverted.

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
The key components of the points shown in Figure 3 are:

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
Switch rails (also known as blades or tongues) are the movable 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
rail sections which guide the train along the straight or the 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
diverging route. They are tapered at their tips so as to fit 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
closely to the adjacent stock rail.

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
Stock rails are the outer running rails for the straight and 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
diverging routes. The tips of the switch rails move up tight 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
against the stock rails when in the closed position for route set. 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
Common crossing (also known as a ‘Frog’ or ‘Vee’ crossing) 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
is the part of the track layout where the switch rails converge. 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
Of necessity, there is a gap in the rails here so that the wheel 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
flanges can pass through. The existence of a gap can however 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
create problems, particularly on long turnouts, and we shall 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
return to this subject in Part 2.

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
Closure rails are non-moving sections of rail that connect the 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
switch rails with the common crossing.

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
Check rails. Also known as guard rails, these are short sections 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
of rail positioned alongside the stock rail to ensure that the 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
wheels follow the correct route through the common crossing 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
(frog). It can be seen in Figure 3 that there are similar rails 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
alongside and forming part of the common crossing. These 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
are known as wing rails (sometimes these are manufactured as 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
part of the common crossing rather than being separate rails).

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
Stretcher bars are provided at intervals between the two 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
switch rails to help ensure that the correct distance is 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
maintained between them not just at the tips but throughout 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
their length. Note that railways in many countries do not use 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
stretcher bars, although they are used in Britain and some 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
other countries whose railways are based on British practice. 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
Where they are provided, the number of stretcher bars is 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
governed by the length of the switch rails, which in turn is 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
determined by the maximum permitted speed of trains taking 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
the diverging route.

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
Switch heels are the demarcation point between the movable 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
switch rails and the fixed closure rails. A heel block assembly is 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
positioned in the vicinity of each heel to maintain the switch, 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
closure and adjacent stock rail in the correct relative positions.

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
All these components work together to guide a train along 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
the correct route. Ensuring that a train can traverse points 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
safely and smoothly, with minimum wear and tear on both 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
the wheels and the track, means that the design of points is 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
a complex matter, particularly where points are very long (for 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
high-speed turnouts).

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
What Figure 3 does not depict, but which can be seen in 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
Figure 4, are the supporting elements for the rails. These 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
include extra-long sleepers which support the rails. Sleepers 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
are known in some parts of the world as bearers, ties or 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
cross-ties. The rails themselves sit on ‘chairs’, as does rail on 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
plain line, of course. Where the switch rails move, the chairs 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
support both the stock rail and the switch rail. These are 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
‘slide chairs’, and as well as holding the stock rail in position 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
they also have a flat surface over which the switch rails move 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
laterally. To aid movement, these surfaces are usually greased, 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
or fitted with plastic inserts to reduce friction, or with rollers 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
which lift the switch rails very slightly while they move.

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
Operational hazards associated  

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
with points

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
So far, we have not said anything about how points are moved 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
and held in position for the passage of a train. This is where 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
the signal engineer comes in! But before we discuss this, we 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
should consider the operational hazards associated with a set 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
of points. Clearly, a section of rail that can move is potentially 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
disastrous for a train. Before reading further, you might like to 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
think for yourself what the principal hazards are. If not, or to 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
check your answers, they are:

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
1. Points not fully in correct position for the safe movement 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
of a train. For facing movements, this is likely to result in 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
derailment. For trailing movements derailment is unlikely, 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
but damage may occur to the points or associated 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
trackside equipment

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
2.

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
 Points in the opposite position to tha t required for 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
safe movement of a train. For facing movements, this 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
will result in the train going on the wrong route, which 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
may have consequences such as derailment as a result 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
of excessive speed, or collision with another train. For 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
trailing movements, the train might derail or, more likely, 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
severe damage is caused to the points and the associated 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
trackside equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
3.

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
 Points moving as a train passes over them. For facing 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
moves, this is very likely to result in derailment of all or 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
part of the train. For trailing movements, it could result in 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
derailment but is more likely to cause damage to the points 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
and associated trackside equipment.

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
4. Excessive speed. This may result in derailment. Most points 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
have, by their very nature, one position which involves a 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
relatively tight radius curve, corresponding to the diverging 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
route. There is generally no super-elevation or ‘cant’ on 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
the diverging route through the points to help the train 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
negotiate the curve (unlike plain line curved track).

--- Document Chunk 202 ---

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
The mechanics of how a wheel stays on the track are 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
complicated, and are beyond the scope of this article, 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
but it is worth noting that in normal running on plain line 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
(including curves), the track and the wheels are designed so 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
that ideally the flange does not come into contact with the 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
inside of the rail. Instead, the concave/conical wheel profile 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
serves to keep each pair of wheels running smoothly on the 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
head (top) of the rail.

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
If you like railway history, you may be interested in exploring 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
how the wheel-rail interface evolved from its origins in the 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
earliest horse-drawn wagonways where the wheel surfaces 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
were flat and ran in grooved wooden “track”, then later 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
where the guiding flanges formed part of the metal track, 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
rather than being part of the wheels, through to the most 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
modern systems which are capable of safely guiding trains 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
travelling at very high speeds.

5. Track gauge is incorrect for safe movement of a train. This 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
is likely to result in derailment. The fact that part of the 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
track is moveable means that there is a somewhat greater 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
risk (compared with plain line) of the track becoming ‘wide 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
to gauge’, because of lateral outward movement of the rails 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
caused by the passage of successive vehicles or trains.

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
6. Broken and worn rails. This may result in derailment. 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
The switch blades and the common crossing have less 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
metal to support the wheels, and both the switch tips 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
and the crossing receive more impact from the wheels, 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
which may cause rails to break. Switch and stock rails also 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
wear through use, especially where heavy traffic uses the 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
diverging route. Excessive wear can lead to derailment.

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
The risks associated with the first three of these hazards are 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
controlled principally through the signalling system, of which 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
we shall say more shortly. 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
The fourth hazard is usually controlled by a speed restriction 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
that applies to trains taking the diverging route, reinforced by 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
controls in the signalling system. These controls may include 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
route and/or speed indications and aspect controls that 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
instruct/remind the driver to slow down, and train protection 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
systems which enforce speed reduction in the event 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
of driver error.

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
The risks relating to the fifth and sixth hazards are controlled 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
principally through track inspection and maintenance.

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
The role of signalling in point operation

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
The role of signalling in the operation of points is to 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
fulfil three basic functions, and they are achieved jointly 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
by the interlocking and the trackside equipment, as 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
described in Table 1.

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
The interlocking features relating to points were described 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
in two previous ‘Back to basics’ articles (IRSE News, April and 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
May 2020), and it is not the intention to repeat them in this 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
article. This article focuses instead on the trackside signalling 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
equipment that moves, locks and checks the points.

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
Point operating mechanisms

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
Manually operated points

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
When railways first began, the practice was for railway 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
personnel to operate a set of points using a lever beside the 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
track. Examples of this can still be found in sidings.  

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
When signal boxes began to appear, the points were operated 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
by moving a mechanical lever in the box. Each point lever was 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
connected via rodding (or sometimes wires) and cranks to the 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
tips of the switch rails of the associated set of points – see 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
Figures 5 and 6. By pulling the lever to the reverse position in 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
the lever frame, the rodding moved in one direction sufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
to move the points into the reverse position. Restoring 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
the lever to the normal position returned the points to the 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
normal position.

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
Because of the weight and the effort required to move the 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
rodding and points via the points lever, the distance from a 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
signal box to a mechanically worked set of points is quite 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
limited (typically to ~200-300 metres). 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
Power operated points 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
Examples of mechanically-worked points can still be found 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
in many parts of the world, but all modern signalling systems 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
use power-operated points. Most commonly this takes the 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
form of an electric motor in what is known as a point machine 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
(also known as a switch machine or switch motor). The 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
point machine is located adjacent to the switch blades and is 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
connected to the tips of the blades either by two rods (one for 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
each blade) or by a single rod and a bar which links the two 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
tips, ensuring they move in synchronism. The bar is commonly 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
known as a ‘lock stretcher bar’. Figure 7 shows a point 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
machine, with the drive rod connecting the electric motor via 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
gears to the blades. As the motor turns, the rod moves to the 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
left or the right, moving the points to the normal or reverse 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
position respectively. Note that there are other rods also 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
shown in the diagram – we shall discuss their purpose shortly. 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
There are many types of point machine in use, with various 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
drive arrangements linking the motor to the switch rails. That 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
shown in Figure 7 is just one example . A layout in a training 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
environment is shown in Figure 8, where the point machine is 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
mounted on extended sleepers, and as with mechanical points 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
a soleplate (extended stock rail gauge tie) maintains the gauge 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
and the distance between the track and the point machine. 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
Over the years, alternative types of powered point operating 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
mechanisms have been produced. Some use hydraulic 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
actuation, such as the clamp lock (other similar devices are 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
known as chair locks, claw locks and ground locks). The clamp 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
lock has a hydraulic power pack instead of an electric motor, 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
with hydraulic rams (jacks) positioned between the sleepers to 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
drive the switch rails to the normal and reverse positions.

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
Function Fulfilled by

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
Move the points to the required position for 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
the passage of a train

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
A trackside point operating mechanism which, under the control of the 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
interlocking, moves the switch rails to the required position. The mechanism 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
is usually mechanically, electrically or hydraulically powered, although some 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
railways use pneumatic power.

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
Check that the points are in the 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
correct position.

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
A trackside mechanism which detects whether the switch rails are correctly 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
positioned and locked (see below) for the safe passage of the train. Often, but 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
not always an integral part of the point operating mechanism (see earlier).

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
The detection of the position of the switch rails is used by the interlocking.

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
Prevent the points moving until the whole of 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
the train has passed safely

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
A locking mechanism which holds the switch rails securely in the required 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
position for the train. Again often, but not always, an integral part of the point 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
operating mechanism

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
In addition, the interlocking has safety features that prevent power being 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
transmitted to the point operating mechanism when there is a route set over a 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
set of points and when there is a train actually on the points.

A further variant is the ‘in sleeper’ (also known as ‘in bearer’) 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
mechanism, where all the machinery is contained within a box 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
or trough which takes the place of a conventional sleeper. This 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
means there is little or no equipment above sleeper level, thus 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
making it easier to undertake mechanised track maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
without risk of damage to the equipment.

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
It is also worth mentioning an example of an innovative 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
approach to point operation which has featured in IRSE 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
News (most recently in May 2019). “Repoint” was a project 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
undertaken by the University of Loughborough (UK) to 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
consider afresh the failure modes of points and to develop an 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
operating mechanism that was more reliable, just as safe, and 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
would help improve track capacity. It illustrates that innovative 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
thinking still has something to contribute to an issue as basic 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
as point operation.

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
Checking that points are  

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
correctly positioned

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
The second signalling function associated with points (listed in 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
Table 1) is to detect the position of the points. This is necessary 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
because it cannot be assumed that the points will move to 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
the position to which they have been called. Ballast or other 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
debris could obstruct the movement, for instance, preventing 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
the switch rail closing against the stock rail. A power failure 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
or malfunction of the point operating mechanism could also 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
prevent the movement. 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
In the situation where the points do not need to be moved 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
for the route being set, it cannot be assumed they are still 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
safely in the correct position for the next train. The passage 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
of the previous trains might have caused the points to 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
open very slightly, through vibration, wear or mechanical 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
failure for instance.

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
How detection works

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
The positions of both switch rails are detected, firstly to be 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
sure that the tip of the closed switch rail is sufficiently close to 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
the stock rail that a wheel flange could not pass between the 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
two rails; and secondly to be sure that the gap between the 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
stock rail and the open switch rail is sufficient for the wheel 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
flanges to pass through.

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
In the case of point machines, detection is achieved using 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
rods that are attached to the tips of the switch blades, which 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
operate electrical contacts in a detector box adjacent to 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
the track as the switches move left or right. In many point 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
machines, the electrical contacts are inside the point machine 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
rather than being a separate unit – see Figures 7 and 8. These 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
are called ‘combined’ point machines. In the case of hydraulic 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
clamp locks, the contacts are in boxes attached to the outsides 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
of the stock rails. 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
The electrical contacts for both switch rails are combined into 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
points detection circuits, the outputs of which are fed back 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
to the interlocking via fail-safe relay circuits or a high integrity 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
transmission system. Hence the interlocking knows whether 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
the points are normal, reverse or in an indeterminate state 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
(neither normal nor reverse).

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
Where points are worked mechanically via rodding, a wholly 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
mechanical detection system is often used. The detection 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
rods are connected to sliding metal plates which engage with 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
similar slotted plates at right angles which are connected to 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
the wires that operate the mechanical signals. This ensures 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
that the wires leading to the signals cannot be operated unless 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
the points are correctly set, and vice versa. Hence there is 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
direct interlocking of points and signals at the trackside, in 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
addition to the interlocking of the levers in the signal box. You 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
can just about see an example of such a device near the top 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
left of Figure 5.

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
Detection tolerances

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
The permissible gaps between the switch and stock rails vary 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
slightly from country to country, but on a standard gauge 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
railway the gap on the closed switch rail side must typically be 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
no more than ~5mm, and on the open switch rail side it must 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
be at least ~115mm (these figures may also vary depending 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
upon the type of points and operating mechanisms). If these 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
criteria are not satisfied, the detection circuits will indicate to 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
the interlocking that the points are not correctly positioned. 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
Tolerances are generally assigned to these values, both to 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
allow some latitude when setting up or maintaining the 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
points and to reduce the risk of the closed switch detection 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
being intermittently lost due to track vibration or slight 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
movement. Thus, for instance, one railway administration 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
states that the closed switch detection contacts must just be 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
made at a switch-stock rail gap of 4mm (but not less) and 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
definitely broken at 6mm.

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
Detection of the open switch may at first sight appear to 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
be less critical than the closed switch, but there have been 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
accidents such as at Kingham (1966) and Grayrigg (2007) , 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
both in Britain, where the open switch rail gap was insufficient. 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
The continual battering by the backs of wheels caused the 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
open switch rail and fittings to be fatigued, causing fractures 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
leading to derailment. The condition of the stretcher bars was 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
implicated in both accidents, incidentally.

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
Locking the points in position

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
The third and final signalling component of points operation 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
is the physical locking of the points in the required position, 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
to minimise the risk of the switch rails moving. The 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
locking mechanism is known as a ‘point lock’ or ‘Facing 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
Point Lock’ (FPL). 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
Why do we lock points?

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
In Britain it has been, from relatively early railway days, a legal 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
requirement that points used by passenger trains in the facing 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
direction are fitted with a lock. The Board of Trade’s 1892 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
requirements relating to the opening of new railways stated 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
that “In order to ensure that the points are in their proper 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
position before the signals are lowered, and, to prevent the 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
signalman from shifting them, while a train is passing over 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
them, all facing points must be fitted with facing-point locks…”.

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
This leads to two key observations. Firstly, the requirement 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
recognised that points traversed in a facing direction present 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
a much greater hazard than in the trailing direction; and 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
secondly, the hazard was originally perceived more in relation 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
to signalman error than the points having an excessive gap 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
between the closed switch and stock rail because of poor 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
adjustment, track movement or wear and tear. The risk of 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
signaller error in relation to points movement has now all but 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
disappeared as a consequence of comprehensive interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
of points, tracks and signals. However, the requirement to lock 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
facing points on passenger lines remains in most countries 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
in the world and serves to minimise the risk of derailment in 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
the vicinity of the blade tips. Furthermore, in practice many 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
railways lock the points for movements in the trailing direction 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
as well as facing, and also lock points on freight-only lines.

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
The extreme dangers associated with facing points can be 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
seen throughout the history of railways. As with so many safety 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
features on railways, accidents led to the introduction of facing 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
point locks. In Britain there was for many years an aversion 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
to having facing points at all, something which reached its 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
height in 1873 when a north-bound express train derailed on 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
points at Wigan station. Thirteen people died as a result of the 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
points moving under the train (not, in this case, by the action 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
of the signalman but because of the excessive speed of the 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
train). The accident brought to the fore the need to fit locks to 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
facing points. Even in relatively modern times points-related 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
accidents have still occurred. Examples include Potters Bar, UK 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
(2002), Grayrigg, UK (2007) and South Carolina, USA (2018).

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
How points are locked

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
As with detection, the facing point lock mechanism varies in 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
design for mechanically-worked and power-operated points. 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
It is instructive to start by looking at mechanical points – see 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
Figure 9. A lock stretcher bar connects the two switch blades. 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
It has two slots cut into it. When the points are in the required 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
position, the signaller pulls the FPL lever. This is a separate 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
lever, not the same one as is used to move the points. The 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
lever is connected via rodding to the lock rod, driving it into 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
one of the two slots in the lock stretcher bar. There is one slot 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
for the points in the normal position, and a second for the 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
reverse position.

--- Document Chunk 512 ---

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
It can be seen that when the lock is engaged in one of the 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
slots, it is impossible for the switch blades to move, either 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
by the signaller attempting to move the points lever or by 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
vibration as a train traverses the points. Figure 9 also shows 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
the metal soleplate (also known as the stock rail gauge tie) on 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
which the lock and the two slide chairs are rigidly mounted 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
to prevent movement and maintain the correct gauge at 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
the switch tips.

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
Moving on to power-operated points, although some railways 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
use point locks which are actuated by a mechanism separate 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
from that which moves the points, more commonly the lock 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
is part of the point operating mechanism. In the case of point 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
machines, the lock is usually contained within the machine. If 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
you look at Figures 7 and 8 you will see that one of the rods 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
coming out of the point machine is connected to the mid-

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
point of the lock stretcher bar. Inside the point machine the 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
rod is connected to a lock mechanism. As the point machine 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
completes the point movement (either normal or reverse) 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
it engages the lock mechanism, so preventing the rod, lock 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
stretcher bar and switch blades from moving until the point 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
machine is powered up again to move the points to the 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
other position. 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
In the case of a clamp lock, the locking mechanism is different, 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
although its purpose is the same. Trying to explain how a 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
clamp lock works is not easy – it is easier to understand by 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
seeing one in action! In essence, there is a G-shaped lock arm 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
(sometimes called a claw) attached by a pivot to the inside 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
of each switch rail. The hydraulic rams move the switch rails 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
via the drive/lock slides and the lock arms, and eventually the 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
free end of the lock arm on the closed switch side is forced 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
up so that it fits tightly against the outside of the stock rail. 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
The switch and stock rails are thus physically clamped to each 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
other and cannot be moved unless the clamp lock is powered 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
to the opposite position – see Figures 10 and 11.

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
Some point operating mechanisms have a quite different 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
type of lock. For instance, the UK High Performance Switch 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
System (HPSS) utilises a lead screw (which moves the 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
blades normal and reverse) combined with a brake, thus 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
preventing any movement of the blades when they are in the 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
required position.

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
In power-operated points, the detection circuits referred 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
to earlier also include electrical contacts to prove that the 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
lock has engaged. Thus, when the detection circuit informs 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
the interlocking that the points are normal or reverse, this 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
information is, in effect confirming that the closed switch is 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
against the stock rail, the other switch is sufficiently open, and 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
the switches are locked in position. 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
It can be seen from what we have considered so far that 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
modern point machines, clamp locks and similar devices 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
combine the functions of point movement, detection and 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
locking in one trackside device. Taking the example of a 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
conventional point machine, a typical sequence of operations 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
for moving the points from normal to reverse is as follows:

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
1. Motor starts turning when power ed from the interlocking.

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
2. Point lock disengages by the action o f the motor. As soon 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
as this starts to happen the normal detection circuit is 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
forced to break (even though the switches are still normal 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
at this stage).

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
3. S witches are driven to the reverse position by the 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
action of the motor.

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
4. Point lock engages by the action o f the motor.

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
5. Reverse detection cir cuit is energised, provided the lock 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
has successfully engaged and both switch rails have fully 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
moved to the reverse position.

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
6. Power to the motor is switched o ff by contacts on the 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
circuit controller inside the point machine (the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
also disconnects the power to the points when reverse 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
detection is obtained).

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
7. The motor is electrically brak ed by ‘snubbing’ contacts on 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
the circuit controller (somewhat like regenerative braking), 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
to avoid damage to the motor and mechanical parts when 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
the movement reaches the end of its travel.

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
Facing point lock tolerances

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
Although it is desirable from a safety perspective for the gap 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
between the closed switch rail and the stock rail to be as small 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
as possible (ideally zero), in practice some tolerance must be 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
applied. Without this, the very slightest movement or incorrect 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
adjustment of the points might mean the point lock could 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
not physically engage. If that were to happen, the detection 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
circuits would indicate that the points were not locked, and 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
therefore trains could not be signalled over them. This is a 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
classic example of a points failure, causing delays to trains 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
and requiring a technician to attend the points. The provision 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
of the tolerance is, therefore, a trade-off between safety 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
and reliability.

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
Accordingly, points are adjusted so that with a very small gap 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
between the switch and stock rail (typically 1.5mm on standard 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
gauge railways) the lock can still engage. If the gap is much 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
larger (typically 3.5mm) the lock must fail to engage. The 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
normal way of checking these gaps is to use a facing point 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
lock gauge. This is nothing more than a small rectangular 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
piece of metal, 1.5mm thick at one end and 3.5mm thick at 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
the other. Each end is in turn inserted between the stock 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
and switch rails, and the points moved (generally by hand 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
operation rather than under power) to check that at 1.5 mm 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
the lock engages and that at 3.5mm it does not. The tolerances 

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
may vary slightly for different railways and countries, but the 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
principles are the same.

Still to come…

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
In this article we have explored the basics of points and point 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
operation, and the role of signalling and the signal engineer in 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
ensuring they work safely. Next month, in Part 2, we will look 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
at some of the additional features and functions associated 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
with points, including topics such as trailable points, catch 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
points, turnouts on high-speed railways, and more.

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
Things to think about 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
You may like to consider the following questions; answers 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
will follow in the March issue of IRSE News.

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
1. Mechanical point r odding (see Figure 6) expands and 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
contracts in length with the air temperature. This 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
could cause points to unlock or move when they 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
should not. How is this prevented from happening?

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
2. S tretcher bars, switch rails and the common crossing 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
provide an electrical connection between the stock 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
rails, which would mean that a track circuit through 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
the points would show permanently occupied. How is 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
this problem overcome?

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
3. In wha t circumstances might points be provided for 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
the purposes of derailing a train?

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
This is the second part of the latest in the IRSE’s “Back 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
to basics” series of articles, aimed particularly at helping 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
people preparing to take the Certificate in Railway 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
Control Engienering Fundamentals (Module A) of the 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
IRSE’s Exam, and those who are new to the industry or 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
the profession of railway signalling and telecoms.

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
In part one (see IRSE News February 2022) we looked 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
at the fundamentals of points and point operation, 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
including how points are moved, detected and 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
locked. In this second part we will explore some of 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
the additional features and functions associated with 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
points. These are not universal, and the details vary, so 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
it is worthwhile investigating whether and how they are 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
applied on railways with which you are familiar.

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
Electrical power for moving points

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
Many point operating mechanisms use relatively low voltages, 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
typically 120V, although voltages as low as 24V may also 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
be encountered. Usually these are DC machines, although 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
some use AC, particularly in DC traction areas for immunity 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
purposes. They may have a peak current requirement of 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
as much as 12A when the points begin to move and at the 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
completion of the movement. Where points are powered 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
directly from the interlocking, the high current requirement 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
constrains the maximum distance to the points, dependent 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
upon the size of cable used, to avoid excessive voltage drop. 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
To overcome this limitation, points may alternatively obtain 

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
their power from a local trackside source, with low power relay 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
or solid-state control circuits connecting the interlocking to 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
the power source, to switch the power on and off as required. 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
Sometimes the power is derived from the traction supply, 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
which can be problematic if the voltage fluctuates depending 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
upon the presence or absence of trains in the vicinity.

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
In some countries, higher voltages (up to 400V AC, sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
three-phase) are used to power the operating mechanisms, 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
which enable the points to be powered directly from the 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
interlocking at much greater distances.

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
Other features of point operating include:

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
• They are often required to be AC immune, to avoid the 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
possibility of electromagnetic induction causing the motor 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
to turn (even slightly) in AC electrified areas.

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
• They usually have some sort of clutch or cut-out so that 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
in the event of the mechanism being unable to complete 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
the point movement (e.g., due to obstruction), the 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
mechanism and the power supply do not suffer damage by 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
continuing to operate. 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
• The design of the clutch or cut-out, and of the internal 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
circuits of the operating mechanism, are such that if the 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
points are prevented from completing their movement, the 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
signaller can call the points back to their original position.

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
Moving power-operated points under failure 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
conditions

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
There must be a means of operating points manually if it is 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
not possible to move them under power. Point operating 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
mechanisms are therefore designed so that they can be 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
operated using a rotary handle or a lever to emulate the 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
operation of the electric motor (albeit slowly), or in the case 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
of hydraulically operated mechanisms, to pump the hydraulic 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
fluid. In some cases the lever is permanently attached to the 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
point operating mechanism and padlocked to prevent misuse 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
– see Figure 1. In other cases the handle is inserted into the 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
machine, which disconnects the electrical supply so that 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
power operation cannot inadvertently re-start (which, apart 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
from anything else, could cause injury to the operator). The 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
handle is kept securely in a trackside cabinet or off-site, to 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
avoid the risk of an unauthorised person attempting to operate 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
the machine with potentially catastrophic results.

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
Time of operation

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
The faster that points can be moved, the more quickly a route 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
can be set, and on busy railways this can have a measurable 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
impact on capacity. Time of operation of points is therefore a 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
factor for consideration. Typically, a point machine can move 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
a set of points in ~3-5 seconds, although mechanisms on long 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
turnouts may take longer. Some operate more quickly –  

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
not much more than 1-2 seconds. Of course, there are other 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
 IRSE News |  Issue 286  |  March 2022

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
12

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
timing factors that need to be considered in determining 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
the total time of operation, including the time that elapses 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
between the signaller initiating the setting of a route over a set 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
of points and the point operating mechanism being powered 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
by the interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
Trailable points

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
Whilst the locking of points is without doubt an important 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
safety feature, it does have a drawback. If a train passes 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
through the points in the trailing direction without authority, 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
with the points set and locked in the opposite position, it is 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
almost inevitable that the operating mechanism and rods 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
will be damaged, and quite possibly the rails as well. This is 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
known as a “run-through”. In extreme situations the locking 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
mechanism may be so effective that the wheel flanges 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
on the closed side are forced up and over the switch rail, 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
derailing the train.

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
To deal with this situation, on some railways the points and 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
their operating mechanisms are designed to be trailable. If a 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
run-through occurs, the sideways pressure of the wheels on 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
the inside of the open switch rail causes the points to unlock, 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
and the closed switch rail is thereby released so that it can 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
open sufficiently for the wheel flanges to pass through. For 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
this to happen, each switch blade is separately driven from 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
the operating mechanism and there are no stretcher bars 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
(and sometimes no point lock). Trailable points may also be 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
‘resettable’, meaning they can be restored to normal operation 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
after a run-through without attendance on-site, or ‘non-

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
resettable’ meaning that on-site intervention is required.

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
Trailable points are also provided on some tram networks 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
and other low-speed railways, not to cater for run-throughs 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
but for legitimate operating movements. These points are 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
“passive” – there is no operating mechanism or lock, and they 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
are spring-loaded or fitted with a non-powered hydraulic 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
piston so that in the absence of a train they always lie in one 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
position (normal or reverse, as required for the situation). If a 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
train passes over the points in the trailing direction which is 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
opposite to the natural lie of the points, the wheel flanges will 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
push the switches to the required position. After all the wheels 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
have passed over, the mechanism will return the points to their 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
natural position. This arrangement can, for example, be useful 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
on simple passing loops on single lines where it saves the 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
cost of providing point operating mechanisms. The downside 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
is that speed restrictions must be applied over the points to 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
minimise the risk of derailment (as well as reducing wear and 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
tear), which is particularly important when making facing 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
movements because there is no Facing Point Lock (FPL).

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
Finally, we should note that hand-operated points, which are 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
used in sidings and are operated by a lever adjacent to the 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
points, are often also trailable in the sense that a train can 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
legitimately move over them in the trailing direction and they 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
move to allow the wheel flanges through. Hand operated 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
points are also used on lower density/rural railways in some 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
countries where it is not economic to provide power-operated 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
points. In these cases, the points are often locked to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
misuse and are non-trailable.

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
Supplementary operating mechanisms

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
So far we have implicitly assumed that if the operating 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
mechanism moves the switch tips to the correct position, 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
all the rest of each switch rail will move as well, maintaining 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
the correct track gauge throughout the points for the route 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
set. This however is not necessarily the case, as the length 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
and weight of the switch rail is considerable. The rail weight 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
is typically 60kg/m and the longest points, found on high-

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
speed lines (where the diverging route speed may by 200km/h 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
or more), may be 150m or more in length from switch tip 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
to common crossing – although of course the switch rails 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
themselves are shorter than this.

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
It is usual therefore, even on points with relatively low 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
diverging route speeds, to fit one or more “back-drives” (also 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
known as supplementary drives). Most commonly these take 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
the form of an assembly of cranks and rodding which connect 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
the switch tips to a position further along the length of the 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
switch – see Figure 2. When the point operating mechanism 

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
moves the switch tips, the motion is transmitted via the cranks 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
and rodding so that the whole length of the switch rail moves 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
in unison. The cranks and rodding must be adjusted correctly, 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
because of course the amount of lateral motion required 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
hydraulically to several setting and locking mechanisms along the 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
length of the switch rails. 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
part-way down the length of the switch is less than at the tips. 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
Sometimes a supplementary detector is fitted further along the 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
switch rails to check that the rails are in the correct position, 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
the contacts of which form part of the detection circuit 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
– see Figure 3.

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
Back drives composed of rodding and cranks are still 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
commonplace although they can be difficult to maintain. 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
Alternatives introduced include a torsion bar mounted along 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
the track and supplementary hydraulic rams.

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
On long turnouts a single point operating mechanism may 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
not have sufficient power to move the whole switch or, even 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
if it does, the switches may bend along their length rather 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
than fully move to the required position. To overcome these 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
problems, supplementary point operating mechanisms 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
(also known as auxiliary actuators) are located part-way 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
along the switch rail – see Figure 4. These are controlled 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
from the interlocking and move at the same time as the 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
operating mechanism at the switch tips. In some cases these 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
supplementary mechanisms may include a lock to help hold 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
the switch rails in position throughout their length.

--- Document Chunk 870 ---

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
Long turnouts are also usually equipped with supplementary 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
detection, which may be integral with the supplementary 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
operating mechanisms where provided. The electrical contacts 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
for these supplementary detectors form part of the overall 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
points detection so far as the interlocking is concerned. 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
However, sometimes the status of each detector is separately 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
indicated (either locally on site or back at the interlocking) to 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
make it easier when fault-finding.

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
Swing nose crossings

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
The greater the length of a set of points, the smaller the angle 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
between the rails where they meet at the common crossing 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
and the longer the gap over which the wheels pass without 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
having a rail to guide or support them – see Figure 5.

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
On very long points this gap would become unacceptably 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
large, and the frog would be too slender to support the wheels. 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
This clearly has safety implications. To overcome this problem, 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
a “swing nose” is used. 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
In a swing nose crossing, the crossing nose (labelled in 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
Figure 5) moves sideways to close the gap for whichever route 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
is set. It has its own operating mechanism to do this, working 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
in synchronism with the other operating mechanism(s) under 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
the control of the interlocking. Detection of the position of the 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
nose forms part of the overall points detection circuit. A swing 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
nose crossing is shown in Figure 6.

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
Swing nose crossings are sometimes also used on turnouts 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
that are not particularly long but where the axle loads are 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
heavy, to minimise damage and noise.

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
Other switch and crossing layouts

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
So far we have considered points which permit a train in 

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
the facing direction to take one of two routes. These can, 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
of course, be used in combination to create more complex 

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
junctions, a simple example being a linking track (crossover) 

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
between two parallel lines. But sometimes there is insufficient 

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
space to accommodate the points required for all the 

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
movements that the operators require. Most commonly this 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
occurs in the vicinity of large stations, including specifically 

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
terminal stations. In such circumstances various options are 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
available to the track engineer, including:

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
• Fixed diamond crossings – which have no moving parts.

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
• Switch diamonds – sometimes known as movable elbows. 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
These are functionally equivalent to a fixed diamond 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
crossover but have moving parts.

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
• Slip switches – sometimes known as double switches, 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
puzzle switches or compound switches.

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
Examples of these are shown in Figures 7, 8 and 9. Other point 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
configurations can be found in various parts of the world, 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
including Y-shaped junctions where both routes are curved, 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
and three-way junctions where there are three routes in the 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
facing direction.

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
Track circuit insulation in points

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
One of the difficulties associated with equipment such as 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
point rods, soleplates and stretcher bars is that they provide an 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
electrical path between the rails, so that a track circuit through 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
the points would show permanently occupied. To address this 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
problem all these components are designed with insulators. An 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
alternative, of course, is to use axle counters, although you will 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
find that most points are provided with insulators as standard, 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
regardless of the means of train detection. 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
The effects of temperature on points

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
Variations in weather, and in particular temperature, can have a 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
significant impact on points, in various ways. Firstly, changes in 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
temperatures can cause the switch rails to vary in length. In the 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
UK, for instance, it is not uncommon to have 10-15 degrees 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
Celsius change in air temperature during the course of a day, 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
plus another ~20 degrees variation in the rail temperature 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
caused by sunlight on the rails. The effect is to move the 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
tapered end of the switch rails forward and back by ~10-

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
15mm, with the additional complication of seasonal changes 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
shifting the mean. Other countries are likely to experience 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
even greater variations. The changing length of the switch rails 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
can cause difficulties in maintaining the correct adjustment of 

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
the locking and detection mechanisms.

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
A second problem is snow, which can cause an obstruction 

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
between the stock and switch rails, preventing the points 

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
from fully moving to the required position. Originally the only 

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
solution was to send people out to clear the snow. Later, gas-

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
powered switch heaters were fitted to the outsides of the stock 

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
rails to melt the snow. Nowadays most switch heaters are 

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
electrically powered.

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
Another temperature-related problem affects the rodding that 

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
is used to move manually operated points (see Part One of 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
this article in the February 2022 edition of IRSE News, and in 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
particular Figures 5 and 6). Thermal expansion and contraction 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
of the rodding can make it impossible to move the points 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
or, potentially, move them slightly without any action by the 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
signaller! To overcome this problem, an arrangement of cranks 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
called a “compensator” is fitted at intervals in the rodding run, 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
which adjusts as the rodding varies in length so as to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
the points becoming inoperable. 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
Points for avoiding collisions

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
Throughout this article we have emphasised the need for 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
safety, primarily to avoid derailments on points. So it may 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
seem strange that the very last types of points to mention 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
are ones which are intended to derail or sidetrack trains and 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
vehicles! These are known as trap points and catch points, 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
although you may hear them referred to as run-off points and 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
derailers. Naming conventions vary across different railway 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
administrations, and the phrases trap points and catch points 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
are often used interchangeably, although historically there 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
is a difference. 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
Trap points are typically provided at the exits of sidings 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
and passing loops, where the track joins a main line – see 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
Figure 10. Unless a route is set for a train into or out of the 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
siding or loop, the trap points are set so that if a train or vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
inadvertently passes the trap points, it is likely to quickly and 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
safely come to a stand, rather than passing onto the main 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
line where a collision could occur with another train. The 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
trap points are usually operated in synchronism with the 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
corresponding points in the main line.

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
Trap points take various forms. In Figure 10, the points have a 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
short length of track beyond them to guide the overrunning 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
vehicles away from the main line (these are called ‘safety 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
points’ in some countries). Sometimes a sand-drag or buffer 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
stop is provided to bring vehicles to a halt as soon as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
Careful site-specific consideration is needed at the design 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
stage, involving both signal and track engineers, as well as 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
operators, to ensure that the train will stop without causing too 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
much damage. At Coton (UK) in 1946 (see irse.info/36tor) a 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
heavily loaded freight train ran out of control on an incline and 

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
was derailed on a set of trap points, completely demolishing a 

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
signal box that was located beyond the points. The destruction 

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
of the signal box caused another set of points to move, which 

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---
sent 24 of the wagons into a siding where they collided with a 

--- Document Chunk 1032 ---
locomotive. It might sound like a comedy of errors, but sadly 

--- Document Chunk 1033 ---
the signalman on duty was killed.

--- Document Chunk 1034 ---
In the example of Figure 10, the function of the trap points is 

--- Document Chunk 1035 ---
not to derail an overrunning train but to bring it to a stand on 

--- Document Chunk 1036 ---
the rails. Where trap points are provided, this is the desirable 

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
option. Other types of trap point are also used, fitted with 

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
either one or two switch rails but no common crossing. These 

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
are intended to cause derailment – see Figure 11. Again, the 

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
aim is to stop the train or vehicle as quickly as possible, clear 

--- Document Chunk 1041 ---
of the running lines and the conflict point ahead. Occasionally, 

--- Document Chunk 1042 ---
wide-to-gauge trap points are provided, where it would be 

--- Document Chunk 1043 ---
unsafe to derail the train either to the left or the right.

--- Document Chunk 1044 ---
However, this is a non-preferred way of stopping an over-

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
running train as a derailment, even at slow speed, is very 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
disruptive (see irse.info/tqlr8 for a YouTube video showing 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
this at Quorn on the Great Central Railway, a heritage 

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
railway in Britain).

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
The signal engineer refers to the use of points to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
collisions when a train passes a signal at danger as “trapping 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
protection”. Trap points are an example of providing points 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
specifically for this purpose but, where possible, points 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
provided for other purposes (for example, as a crossover 

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
between two lines) are set by the interlocking to provide 

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---

a section of line that is hopefully clear of other trains, rather 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
than into the path of another train. This interlocking feature is 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
commonly known as flank protection.

--- Document Chunk 1064 ---
When used in dark territory (railway lines not controlled by 

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
signals but using train orders or track warrants to authorise 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
movements), trap points are usually locally operated by 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
hand with suitable locking arrangements to prevent misuse. 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
They may be the responsibility of others rather than the 

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
signal engineer.

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
Trap points are still used at many locations on railways 

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
throughout the world, but catch points are rare on modern 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
railways. They were provided on steep inclines in the days 

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
when railway vehicles were unbraked. If a train split in two 

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
as it ascended an incline, the back portion would run back 

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
down the gradient. The function of the catch points was to 

--- Document Chunk 1076 ---
derail the vehicles as they ran back, to avoid the possibility 

--- Document Chunk 1077 ---
of them running further downhill and colliding with another 

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
train. Catch points were generally not worked either by the 

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
signalman or the interlocking. As the train ascended the 

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
gradient it passed over the points in the trailing direction. 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
The switch blades would be moved into the correct position 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
by the wheels and return to the derail position after the train 

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
had passed. Self-evidently, unworked catch points were only 

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
installed on uni-directional lines!

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
Finally, although outside the scope of this article since they are 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
not points, it is worth noting that derailers are widely used in 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
North America and elsewhere as an alternative to trap points.

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
They take various forms, usually a bolt-on to the running 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
rail (there is no movable switch rail). When set to derail, the 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
mechanism forces the wheels up and over the running rail 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
thereby derailing the vehicle(s). Derailers may be operated by 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
a hand lever (often called a “switchstand” in North America), or 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
by power, and they may be fitted with locks and detectors for 

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
integration into the signalling system.

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
Closing thoughts

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
In these two articles we have explored the basics of points 

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
and point operation, and the role of signalling and the signal 

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
engineer in ensuring they work safely. More varieties of points 

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
exist than we have covered, not only for main line and metro 

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
railways, but also for rural and low density railways, tram 

--- Document Chunk 1101 ---
railways, rack railways, dual gauge railways and more. But the 

--- Document Chunk 1102 ---
principles of safe operation are more or less the same.

--- Document Chunk 1103 ---
If you are new to railway signalling we encourage you to ask 

--- Document Chunk 1104 ---
your mentor or manager to arrange a visit to a set of points 

--- Document Chunk 1105 ---
so that you can see for yourself what you have read about 

--- Document Chunk 1106 ---
in these articles. But take care and obey all the safety rules – 

--- Document Chunk 1107 ---
points are hazardous, and so are the trains that run over them.

--- Document Chunk 1108 ---
In a future article we will look at the maintenance of points 

--- Document Chunk 1109 ---
from a signal engineering point of view, including specifically 

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
the use of remote condition monitoring.
