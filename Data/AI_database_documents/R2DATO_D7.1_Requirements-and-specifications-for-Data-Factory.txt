EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
Context and Objectives: The European railway industry is undergoing a significant technological 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
transformation, with many infrastructure managers, railway undertakings and companies aiming for 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
extensive automation and digitization of rail operations. This push is geared towards e nhancing 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
capacity and reliability in rail operations. 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
In this context, the R2DATO project aims to revolutionize the European railway infrastructure through 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
digitalization and automation, leading up to autonomous train operations.  

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
The surge in automation and digitization necessitates a parallel increase in data generation and 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
utilization within the rail system. Particularly with regards to fully automated driving (referred to as 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
automation level 4, or GoA4), the integration of sensors and cameras is crucial for automatic 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
response to hazards in the rail environment through artificial intelligence (AI). Developing AI software 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
for environmental perception, for instance, demands vast amounts of high-quality data. However, it's 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
evident that individual rail entities may struggle to amass sufficient sensor data for adequately 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
training AI systems for fully automated rail operations. 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
There is therefore a growing consensus that a Data Factory is essential - an ecosystem that enables 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
sensor data to be collected, simulated, processed and shared, as well as AI-models to be generated, 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
certified and implemented in automated rail operations. 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
Figure 1: Simplified target configuration of the Data Factory 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
In Germany, Deutsche Bahn has launched the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland (DSD) 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
to facilitate this technological transformation and has set up a Data Factory prototype  [20] for the 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
development of GoA4 fully automated driving. 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
In the R2DATO work package WP7, the further development and expansion of the Data Factory was 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
driven forward and stakeholder requirements for the system were compiled. This further sharpened 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
the picture of the target functionalities and system and subsystem architectures were derived. 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
This document presents the target configuration of the Data Factory and contains the system and 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
subsystem requirements, as well as the requirements for data quality, annotations and security.

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
This study is closely related to the HADEA project CEF2 Pan-European Railway Data Factory [4], a 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
collaborative ecosystem consisting of several individual Data Factories that enables railway 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
infrastructure managers and railway companies to collect, process and exchange sensor data 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
through a standardized infrastructure.  

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
This document therefore presents the architecture of a Data Factory that can be integrated into a 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
Pan-European Data Factory. 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
Figure 1 shows the simplified target configuration of the Data Factory with the data flow from the 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
vehicle via the Touchpoint to the Data Centre. The basic functionalities, which will be discussed in 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
more detail later in the document, are described in italics. The physical IT assets and the data are 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
shown in black and the toolchain with the most important platform functionalities is shown in blue. 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
Vehicle Data Logger: At the vanguard of data acquisition, the Vehicle Data Logger is a designated 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
to record onboard data  on trains, capturing sensor data and crucial operational metrics  and to 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
transfer the data manually or wirelessly to the track-side (Figure 2 and sections 2.5.1, 2.5.5, 2.7.10). 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
Data Touchpoint: Strategically placed Data Touchpoints are used for the automatic, wireless and 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
secure transfer of data from the Vehicle to the Data Centre (see Figure 3 and section 2.7.3). The 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
Touchpoints also perform data processing and prioritisation so that only data of high quality and 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
importance needs to be transmitted.

Data Center with HPC infrastructure and Toolchain: This part of the Data Factory forms the core 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
of functionalities to aggregate, process and store huge amounts of data. The infrastructure is 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
scalable and will enable developers and partners to access datasets and to perform calculations. 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
2.) Ingestion system to incorporate data respectively sensor data, also from physical SSDs 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
3.) HPC cluster for machine learning, training and evaluation of AI-models 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
4.) HPC cluster for simulation of virtual railway scenarios and synthetic sensor data 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---

FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 6 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
Moreover, the final state of the Data Factory will include a toolchain, which is formed from various 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
subsystems: 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
- The Simulation Platform subsystem, which generates data for various operational scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
and synthetic sensor data; see chapter 2.7.8. 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
- The Data Platform , which is the central subsystem where data is stored, processed and 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
provided to either other subsystems or users; see chapter 2.7.2. 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
- The ML Platform subsystem , which offers methods to generate model architectures , train 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
and evaluate  machine learning models  e.g. for object detectors , predictive analytics or 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
automated decision-making; see chapter 2.7.7. 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
- The Integration Platform, which e nsures provision of compute resources to all subsystems 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
and an interactive compute environment to the users; see chapter 2.7.4.  

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
- The IT System Management, which monitors the subsystems and monitors the activities to 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
ensure the integrity and performance of the Data Factory; see chapter 2.7.6. 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
- The System Access & Security Platform , which  provides functions for i dentification and 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
authentication, use control, system integrity, data confidentiality, restricted data flow, timely 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
response to events and resource availability; see chapter 2.7.9. 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
- The Accounting Service, which ensures a transparent billing associated to utilization and 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
resource usage; see chapter 2.7.11. 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
- Interconnect Platform, which ensures the connection to external IT assets and other Data 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
Factories and an integration into a Pan-European Data Factory; see chapter 2.7.5 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
Main Findings: The development of a Data Factory is about the comprehensive integration of data 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
and data processing technologies with traditional railway systems. Key components such as sensor 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
data acquisition with a Vehicle Data Logger, Data Touchpoints, edge components and IT assets in 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
the Data Centre as well as a uniform toolchain are to be designed in such a way that they form a 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
uniform platform overall. 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
This platform should in turn be integrated into the concept of the Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF) 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
[5][15], in which individual Data Factories or individual IT assets of the members are connected to 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
each other, realised with a high-speed backbone network [8] and implemented by defining common 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
data standards and interfaces. In the vision, the final expansion stage will comprise a uniform and 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
shared toolchain. 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
This merger is intended to achieve synergy effects that will enable to master the complex tasks of 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
generating permissible AI functions for automated train operation in accordance with GoA4. 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
Recommendations for the Future: Building on Deliverable 7.1 as a basis, the Data Factory should 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
be further developed and gradually integrated into the PEDF as described in [13] and [14]. It must 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
be ensured that the Data Factory remains adaptable and compatible with various railroad systems 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
and third-party technologies. 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
In summary, Report 7.1 is a testament to the collaborative efforts undertaken within the R2DATO 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
project to create a data -centric future for rail transportation. It serves as a strategic dossier for the 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
successful creation of a data and AI platform for the implementation of functions for GoA4 automated 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
train operation.

Acquisition 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
Frequency 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
The acquisition frequency is the rate at which the sensors trigger. 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
It determines the delta between two consecutive frames, in 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
particular the delta between two Acquisition Timestamps. 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
Acquisition 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
Timestamp 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
The acquisition timestamp is the time when a frame is physically 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
captured. The physical event that is stamped with the acquisition 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
time has to be defined for each sensor modality. In terms of 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
camera this can be any time from the opening to the closing of 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
the shutter. In terms of lidar this can be any time from sending the 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
light impulse to detecting (receiving) the reflection. 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
For sensors that record multiple returns (such as LiDAR), each 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
return has its own time stamp or an offset to the time stamp for a 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
set of returns (e.g. a point cloud).

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
Frame A single measurement from one sensor like an infrared camera, 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
visual camera, lidar, or RADAR. 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
Frame Drop A frame drop is the event of missing the sensor information for a 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
specific point in time at which a message was expected 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
according to the Acquisition Frequency. Frame drops can happen 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
due to a failure in performing the message, as well as any loss of 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
this information on the way to the subsystem expecting the 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
message. A Frame Drop leads to a delta between to consecutive 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
Frames that is twice as large as expected. Multiple Frame Drops 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
can occur successively. 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
Frame metadata  Describes information about a single frame, such as weather 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
condition, train speed, number or type of detected objects. 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
Everything that can be derived from existing data (e.g., in data 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
pipelines) is also called metadata. 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
The hardware configuration describes the set of hardware that is 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
used and affects the sensor data. It consists of serial numbers of 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
sensors and sensor accessories (such as lenses), the lens 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
configuration and identifier of other hardware parts used in the 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
system. 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
Highest Quality The highest quality of sensor data is the configuration of the 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
sensors that delivers all information that the sensor is physically 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
able to capture and designed to provide to the user. This means, 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
as an example, when the sensor can capture images with 16bit 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
image depth, choosing 16bit means higher quality that choosing 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
12bit as the 16bit image contains more information in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
dynamic range. Parameters that affect that data quality are, 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
among others, the acquisition frequency, the resolution, the point 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
density (LiDAR), the dynamic range (camera). 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
As there are usually technical limitations for the system, there is 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
usually a trade-off to get the highest possible data quality for the 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
respective use-case given the system's performance.

1 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
1.1 ABOUT DELIVERABLE 7.1 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
This document serves as Deliverable 7.1, titled "Requirements and Specifications on Data Factory" 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
underpinning the development work carried out in the context of the Shift2Rail initiative. Specifically, 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
this deliverable fits within the framework of the Technology Demonstrator (TD) and Work Area (WA) 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
corresponding to Information Technology Solutions for Train Operation. 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
The R2DATO project contributes to the broader Shift2Rail objectives by targeting advancements in 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
rail system automation, pushing forward the boundaries toward fully autonomous train operations. 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
The work detailed herein contributes to the accomplishment of key objectives set out for TD/WA on 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
Next-Generation Train Control and Communication Systems, achieving a Technology Readiness 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
Level (TRL) that demonstrates a significant step forward from the conceptual stage to the system 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
prototyping in operational environments. 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
Background and Project Contribution: The rail industry is at a pivotal junction, with digitalization 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
promising to redefine the performance, reliability, and safety standards of rail operations. Within this 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
evolutionary path, the R2DATO project stands out with its specific contribution to the  Shift2Rail 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
program. It aims to leverage data -driven methodologies to enhance the control, monitoring, and 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
predictive capabilities of European rail operations. 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
Objectives and Aim of this Deliverable: The primary objective of this deliverable is to outline the 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
requirements and specifications of a Data Factory and the data itself. The data serves as backbone 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
for analytics and machine learning to develop AI functions for GoA 4 automated  train operation  

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
(ATO). The Data Factory , particularly in combination with the concept of the Pan -European Data 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
Factory (PEDF) is envisioned as a central hub for collecting  and storing huge amount of data for 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
Machine Learning tasks , supporting the Shift2Rail's goals of increasing efficiency and advancing 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
toward autonomous train operation. 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
Motivation: The setup of the Data Factory is motivated by the need  to develop fully automated 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
driving with AI-functionalities for environment perception , incidence management, localization and 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
other functionalities.  

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
To achieve this, huge amounts of data needs to be collected, transferred, processed an annotated, 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
also synthetic data needs to be simulated to generate data of rare railway scenarios. With this data 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
machine learning is performed to train AI -models and the data also serves for the evaluation and 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
testing. At the end of the process a platform is needed for certification and homologation of thes e 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
functions (see Figure 5).

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
We except that these complex tasks  cannot be carried out by the railway suppliers, Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
Managers (IMs) and Railway Undertakings (RUs) independently by themselves. 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
This document outlines the needs placed on the Data Factory  and contains the system and 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
subsystem requirements with its logical architectures.  

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
In a further step multiple individual Data Factories or single assets shall be interconnected to form a 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF, see section 2.3.3) with a consortium setup that also may include 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
safety authorities. Within the PEDF common data s tandards and interfaces will be defined and a 

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
uniform toolchain will leverage synergy effects by greatly increasing the amount of data available, 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
while at the same time preserving the data sovereignty of the members. 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
Proposed Solution and Document Structure: The proposed solution involves a modular, scalable 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
Data Factory architecture, consisting of train, trackside and Data Centre systems. The deliverable 

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
details the stakeholder needs, the derived requirements, functions and logical architectures.

2 MAIN PART 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
2.1 BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
AND GOALS 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
To meet the increasing demand for transportation of both passengers and freight, R2DATO will take 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
the advantages of digitalisation and automation to develop the Next Generation AT O and deliver 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
scalable Digital and Automatic (up to Autonomous) Train Operation (DATO) capabilities in order to 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
enhance the capacity of the existing rail networks.  

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
The goal of the Data Factory is to serve as a platform that provides data, in particular sensor data 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
and simulated synthetic data, as well as machine learning functionality for training and evaluating 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
AI-models. In the future, this platform will also stream data to HiL test stands and will provide data 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
and tools for certification.   

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
The goals of WP7 Data Factory are: 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
• D7.1: Development of the Data Factory specifications that is compatible with the PEDF 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
concept and the ongoing expansion of the infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
• D7.2: Legal assessment of the Data Factory 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
• D7.3: Joint simulation of scenarios and production of synthetic sensor data 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
• D7.4: Joint collection and annotation of sensor data 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
• D7.5: Generation of sensor-based object detectors for perception using machine learning 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
• D7.6: Provision of an Open -Data-Set consisting of real sensor data of the railway 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
environment, associated annotations, simulated synthetic data and digital map data 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
The Data Factory has to be designed in such a way that it can collect and process data from up to 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
27 countries with different boundary conditions and rules. We assume that only some RUs, IMs and 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
rail suppliers will set up a fully developed Data Factory based on the specifications provided here. 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
Some stakeholders will probably only implement partial aspects or use the services of another 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
stakeholder's data factory. 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
It must also be ensured that existing and planned Data Factories can be linked together in the future 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
to form a Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF) [4], similar to GaiaX CartenaX [21]. 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
We also assume that once the AI models have reached a certain level of quality, the amount of data 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
to be collected will decrease over the years. 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
The g oal of the task  7.1 is to collect the requirements and specifications for the Data  Factory 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
infrastructure and the toolchain for the purpose of data simulation, engineering, and ML/AI model 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
training for GoA3/4 operation . Also, the specifications on the data itself and a sector -wide data 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
ownership model towards the release of an Open-Data-Set will be carried out.

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
2.2 SCENARIO 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
The basic scenario is built on following Assumptions, Experiences of similar projects and Exclusions 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
and Legal Considerations. 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
2.2.1 Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
• Up to 60 TB of raw sensor data will be generated per train per day. 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
• For a basic data collection, the assumption is that at least 2 trains per country will be used. 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
• Data will be transmitted to a Data Centre or cloud for a subsequent data ingestion, preferably 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
wirelessly or through other appropriate methods within the respective country or region. 

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
• The Data Factory's setup (cloud -based, on -premise, or hybrid) will be determined after 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
analysing use cases to find the optimal solution. 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
• It is assumed that the results of the trained machine learning (ML) models will be utilized for 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
the perception systems. 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
• For certification and homologation huge amounts of data and a certified common toolchain 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
are necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
2.2.2 Project Setup Based on Experience 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
• Data will be collected using specially equipped trains with cameras lidar, radar and 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
localization sensors, with the main data volume coming from high-resolution cameras. 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
• Data will be transmitted into the Data Factory via network infrastructure. 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
• In the initial stage, data annotation will be manual and in later stages semi-automatic. 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
• The training and validation of AI-models will occur within the Data Factory. 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
• The Data Factory will also be responsible for testing AI-models. 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
• Regular monthly releases for training, a practice from the automobile sector, are expected. 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
• Up to 30 training cases may be used in parallel, another insight from the automobile sector. 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
2.2.3 Exclusions and Legal Considerations 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
• The rules for certification, to be determined by legal authorities, are not included in the work 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
package WP7, but it is expected that all data used for training must be stored for future audits. 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
• Operational aspects of the trained ML models and vehicle onboard perception systems are 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
excluded from the WP but have a significant connection with WP11. 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
• Operational components of the Data Cent re and security configuration and operation are 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
beyond the scope of the WP.

2.3 CONNECTED WPS OR PRE 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
PROJECTS 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
Results of pre projects of the sector were included as far as the Data Factory is concerned. Also, the 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
WP within R2Dato was considered.  

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
2.3.1 X2Rail4 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
X2Rail-4, part of the Shift2Rail initiative, is focused on developing advanced signalling and 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
automation systems for railways, including specifications for Grade of Automation 3/4 (GoA3/4). This 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
project is crucial for integrating Machine Learning (ML) outcomes from data factories into the train's 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
perception systems. While train-internal perception systems are outside this Work Package's scope, 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
the alignment of ML results with X2Rail -4's architecture is essential for seamless integration and 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
operational efficiency in railway systems. [17] 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
X2Rail4 delivers the specifications concerning GoA3/4. Results of the Data Factory ML training must 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
fit to the architecture mentioned there.  

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
Assumptions: 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
• X2Rail-4 is tasked with developing specifications for Grades of Automation 3 and 4 (GoA3/4) 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
to guide the architecture of train perception systems. 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
• The results from the Data Factory's machine learning (ML) processes are expected to align 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
with X2Rail-4's architectural specifications to ensure system compatibility and integration. 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
Boundaries: 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
• The project does not include vehicle internal perception systems within its Work Package 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
(WP), delineating the scope of X2Rail-4's responsibilities. 

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
• Clear interfaces and logical infrastructure alignment with X2Rail -4's standards are 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
mandatory, even though direct involvement with vehicle internal perception systems is 

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
outside the project's direct scope.

2.3.2 Tauro Shift2Rail 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
Tauro is instrumental in advancing Shift2Rail's mission, concentrating on data management and AI 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
integration for railway systems. It facilitates the introduction of sophisticated AI models into railway 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
operation frameworks, enhancing system functionality and data-driven decision-making [3]. 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
Aligning with Shift2Rail Objectives 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
• Data Platforms & AI -Data basis Role: Tauro provides the foundation for extensive, high -

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
quality datasets, essential for training robust AI models that enhance railway operations and 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
safety. 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
• Consistency with Shift2Rail's Framework: Tauro's methodology and outputs are designed to 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
seamlessly mesh with Shift2Rail's broader architectural standards, ensuring interoperability 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
and optimization. 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
• Development and Standardization : Tauro assumes the responsibility for the development 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
and provision of standardized data management practices in line with Shift2Rail's automation 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
goals. 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
• Machine Learning Integration: It is presumed that Tauro's machine learning outcomes will be 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
consistent with the technical specifications outlined by Shift2Rail to facilitate GoA3/4

automation levels. 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
Boundaries: 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
• Scope of Work: While Tauro is pivotal in data and AI aspects, it does not extend its purview 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
to the development of train -internal perception systems, which remains beyond its defined 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
scope. 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
• Interface Specification : Tauro ensures the definition of clear interfaces and compatibility 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
standards, aligning with Shift2Rail's infrastructure requirements while maintaining its 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
specified boundaries. 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
Conclusion and Integration Pathway: 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
Tauro serves as a bridge between data -centric AI development and Shift2Rail's ambitious 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
automation objectives, providing the necessary data infrastructure while adhering to set boundaries 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
and integration specifications.

2.3.3 CEF 2 RailDataFactory 

--- Document Chunk 1036 ---
Railways in Europe are actively working on GoA4 automated rail operations. However, this requires 

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
the collection of large amounts of sensor data for AI training - a task that can be challenging for 

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
individual railroads or suppliers. To tackle this problem, the concept of a pan -European Rail Data 

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
Factory has proven to be a promising solution. The CEF2 RailDataFactory study [4], envisioned as 

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
a collaborative infrastructure and partner ecosystem, offers a way forward for RUs, IMs and railway 

--- Document Chunk 1041 ---
suppliers. 

--- Document Chunk 1042 ---
This study was carried out and successfully completed in 2023 as a joint effort between DB, SNCF 

--- Document Chunk 1043 ---
and NS. Co -funded by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HADEA), the study 

--- Document Chunk 1044 ---
examined various aspects, including technical, operational, commercial, legal and strategic 

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
considerations. 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
The Pan-European Railway Data Factory (PEDF) is conceptualized as a collaborative infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
and ecosystem that integrates data from various sources to enable fully automated train operation 

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
across Europe [5] by creating a shared infrastructure for extensive sensor data collection, processing 

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
and AI development. 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
Figure 7: Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF) as union of many individual Data Factories 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
Figure 7 shows the PEDF as an interconnection and association of several individual data factories 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
or individual IT assets that are to be connected via a high-speed backbone network [8]. The individual 

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
Data Factories that are part of the PEDF can exist in different expansion stages. 

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
What is important, however, is the definition of common data standards and interfaces, as well as 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
the prospective creation of a uniform common toolchain.  The basic idea of the PEDF is that each 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
member retains sovereignty over its data because the (private) data does not flow out of the 

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---
respective Data Factory. However, the members can use the partners' data to conduct data analyses 

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
or train and evaluate AI models using the uniform toolchain.  This construction is similar to GaiaX 

--- Document Chunk 1060 ---
CartenaX, see section 2.3.5 and [21]. 

--- Document Chunk 1061 ---
The strategy for building the PEDF is divided into short, mid and long-term time periods as shown in 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
Figure 8. Initially, each stakeholder, whether RU, IM or railway  supplier, has its own proprietary 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
solutions. But in the m id-term, the first common standards for data and interfaces should help to

FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 30 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
establish data compatibility, so that synergy potentials can be realised in the long -term by greatly 

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
increasing the basic data population for all members [14]. 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
These efforts to create common interfaces and a common, uniform toolchain are to be bundled in 

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
the interface pillar and the toolchain pillar. These represent working groups and standardisation 

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
committees.

CEF2 RailDataFactory study carried out some initial use cases and requirements [5] and are the 

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
basis for the requirements in this document in section 2.7.5.  

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
The building blocks and components elaborated in the CEF2 study [6] are compatible with those in 

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
this document (section 2.7).  

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
The comprehensive cyber security assessment, the IAM concept and the data management concept 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
from CEF2 [7] are complementary to the System Access and Security Platform in section 2.7.9 and 

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
the Data Platform in section 2.7.2 presented here. 

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
The CEF2 study also highlighted the bottlenecks for data applications in vehicles [9], carried out a 

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
business case analysis [10] and derived mitigation measures for cyber security risks [11]. 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
A l egal and regulatory assessment with focus on data privacy was carried out in [12] and t he 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
deployment strategy can be found in [13] and [14].

2.3.4 Open Sensor Data for Rail - OSDaR23 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
Publicly available data sets from the railroad sector are very rare. Therefore, the DB InfraGO AG, 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
within the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland (DSD), and the German Centre for Rail 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
Transport Research (DZSF) at the Federal Railway Authority (EBA) have created the first publicly 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
available multi-sensor data set, i.e. Open Sensor Data for Rail (OSDaR23) [1][2]. The sensor dataset 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
annotated as part of the project was recorded in several data collection runs in Hamburg by DSD. 

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
The dataset contains regular railroad environments and scenes from regular operating as well as 

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
some special situations and objects (like flames and smoke), which were posed. 

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
OSDaR23 is a manually annotated open dataset with a multi -sensor setup for the railway 

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
environment. The multi -sensor setup includes 3 high resolution cameras, 3 medium resolution 

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
cameras, 3 infrared cameras, 3 long -range LiDARs, 1 mid -range Lidar, 2 short -range LiDARs, 1 

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
long-range radar, 4 inertial measurement units, 4 GPS/GNSS sensors, which are usually at the front 

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
of the train. An annotation requirements specification was developed that describes the used

2.3.5 GaiaX CartenaX 

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
The Gaia-X CartenaX project is part of the larger Gaia-X initiative, which aims to establish a secure 

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
and sovereign European data infrastructure. Specifically focusing on the automotive industry, the 

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
CartenaX project aligns with Gaia-X's mission by creating a framework for secure and collaborative 

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
data exchange within the automotive sector. Leveraging the principles of Gaia-X, CartenaX seeks to 

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
empower automotive manufacturers and suppliers to share data while ensuring sovereignty and 

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
security over their information. 

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
CartenaX aims to develop standards, protocols, and tools tailored to the automotive industry's unique 

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
data needs. By promoting interoperability and data sharing, the project aims to facilitate innovation 

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
and digital transformation across the automotive val ue chain. Through collaborative data 

--- Document Chunk 1121 ---
ecosystems, CartenaX endeavors to enhance decision -making processes, drive competitiveness, 

--- Document Chunk 1122 ---
and accelerate the development of new products and services in the automotive sector. 

--- Document Chunk 1123 ---
In essence, the Gaia -X CartenaX project serves as a vital step toward establishing a trusted and 

--- Document Chunk 1124 ---
interconnected data infrastructure for the automotive industry, contributing to Europe's broader 

--- Document Chunk 1125 ---
digital sovereignty objectives [21].

2.4 DEPENDENCIES TO OTHER 

--- Document Chunk 1134 ---
WPS 

--- Document Chunk 1135 ---
Work package WP7 has dependencies to WP11, WP27, WP30 and WP43. 

--- Document Chunk 1136 ---
2.4.1 WP11 - Prototype development of perception system 

--- Document Chunk 1137 ---
WP11 has as connection to WP7 since the Deliverable D11.1 (Datasets for Perception System) shall 

--- Document Chunk 1138 ---
be compliant with the here proposed requirements on data quality (section  2.5.4) and annotations 

--- Document Chunk 1139 ---
(section 2.5.6).  

--- Document Chunk 1140 ---
Also there may be a connection between D11.3 (PoC of Perception System)  if some prototypical 

--- Document Chunk 1141 ---
models from D7.5 (Perform ML/AI model training) shall be used.  

--- Document Chunk 1142 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1143 ---
2.4.2 WP27 - Digital register Specification, Development and  

--- Document Chunk 1144 ---
Implementation 

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
WP27 has a connection to WP7 since it if planned that the Deliverable D7.3 (Perform simulation with 

--- Document Chunk 1146 ---
initial implementation of the Fata Factory) includes simulation data at locations that are covered by 

--- Document Chunk 1147 ---
the digital register. 

--- Document Chunk 1148 ---
Also, D7.6 (Release Open-Data-Set) shall include those parts of the digital register, where the sensor 

--- Document Chunk 1149 ---
data and synthetic data was acquired respectively simulated. This activity is related to D27.5 (Digital 

--- Document Chunk 1150 ---
Register Object Catalogue for the Data Factory). 

--- Document Chunk 1151 ---
2.4.3 WP30 – Conceptual Data Model and semantic dictionary evolution 

--- Document Chunk 1152 ---
WP30 has a connection to WP7 as the data factory has to be designed compliant to an overall ERJU 

--- Document Chunk 1153 ---
data ontology. 

--- Document Chunk 1154 ---
This includes both top-down designed data models and bottom-up driven data collections such as 

--- Document Chunk 1155 ---
the sensor data ontology in section 2.5.3.   

--- Document Chunk 1156 ---
2.4.4 WP43 - Freight Demonstrator 

--- Document Chunk 1157 ---
WP43 was supposed to deliver sensor data to WP7 that should have been implemented into D7.6 

--- Document Chunk 1158 ---
(Release Open-Data-Set). The current status is that no data can be supplied from WP 43, which is 

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
why mitigation measures have to be taken by DB to generate D7.6.

2.5 DATA REQUIREMENT 

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
SPECIFICATION 

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
2.5.1 Sensor Data 

--- Document Chunk 1170 ---
This section describes the sensor data using an exemplary sensor setup with 20 sensors  mounted 

--- Document Chunk 1171 ---
at a train front (see Figure 10). The setup includes color and infrared cameras, lidars, a radar, gas 

--- Document Chunk 1172 ---
and particle detectors and a localization unit as sensor modalities.  

--- Document Chunk 1173 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1174 ---
Figure 10: Sensor setup with more than 20 sensors mounted at a train front. 

--- Document Chunk 1175 ---
The camera modality comprises 3 medium-resolution, 3 high-resolution color cameras and 3 infrared 

--- Document Chunk 1176 ---
cameras. The three color cameras (RGB) cover a total horizontal field-of-view (FOV) of 70°, whereby 

--- Document Chunk 1177 ---
the FOVs between two color cameras overlap by 10°. The three infrared cameras each have a long 

--- Document Chunk 1178 ---
focal length and cover a total horizontal FOV of 30°, with the FOVs of the second infrared camera 

--- Document Chunk 1179 ---
overlapping by 1°. The medium-resolution, high-resolution and infrared camera have a respective 

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
resolution of 5, 12 and 1.2 megapixel.  

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
The lidar modality comprises 3 long -range lidars, 1 mid -range lidar and 2 corner lidars. The three 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
long-range lidars cover a total horizontal FOX of 16°, with the FOVs of two lidars overlapping by 2°. 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
The mid-range lidar has a horizontal FOV of approximate ly 180°. The corner lidars are mounted in 

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
such a way that the FOV also extends to the rear and each corner lidar thus covers approximately 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
270°, whereby the entire area in front of the vehicle is covered equally by both lidars. The total 

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
resolution of all Lidars in the setup is a maximum of 240.000 points per frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
The radar modality consists of a long -range radar, which has a horizontal FOV of 180° , a range 

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
resolution of approximately 18cm and a maximum detection range of 500 meters. 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
The gas sensor modality has 2 sensors , 1 gas and 1 particle sensor . The gas sensor detects the 

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
concentration of CO2 in air by absorption spectroscopy and the particle sensor detects the 

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
concentration of five different particle sizes in air between 0.5 - 10 µm in diameter.   

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
The localization modality records the horizontal localization information or position via GNSS satellite 

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
positioning, as well as gyroscope and acceleration information via IMU.

--- Document Chunk 1200 ---
The sensor data in this setup was mapped in a data model, see section 2.5.2. In addition, a strong 

--- Document Chunk 1201 ---
focus was placed on data quality. The data quality requirements can be found in section 2.5.4 and 

--- Document Chunk 1202 ---
the data recorded in the described sensor setup meets these data quality requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1203 ---
The sensor data of this setup was then annotated, with great emphasis placed on the quality of the 

--- Document Chunk 1204 ---
annotations. In -depth annotation requirements were developed, which are presented in section 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
2.5.6. 

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
The annotation requirements are further developed in various projects together with the German 

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF) of the German Federal Railway Authority (EBA). 

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---
One of these projects also resulted in the first high-quality multimodal sensor data set from the single-

--- Document Chunk 1209 ---
railway sector OSDaR23, see section 2.3.4.  

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
2.5.2 Data Model 

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---
2.5.2.1 Ontology 

--- Document Chunk 1212 ---
A Sensor data ontology is a formal description of sensor data to enable data exchange between 

--- Document Chunk 1213 ---
multiple applications across different organizations with a common understanding of the structure 

--- Document Chunk 1214 ---
and meaning of the information.  

--- Document Chunk 1215 ---
The common language provided by a sensor data ontology captures agreements on information and 

--- Document Chunk 1216 ---
structure and what this information represents, enabling smart data exchange between applications 

--- Document Chunk 1217 ---
and organizations. 

--- Document Chunk 1218 ---
Figure 11 shows the connection and hierarchy between the raw sensor data, capability and entity 

--- Document Chunk 1219 ---
metadata and the ontology.

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
Raw Sensor Data - Are the measured values that are generated during the measurements. The data 

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured, uncompressed or compressed. 

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
Capability Metadata - Is the metadata that describes the properties of the raw data. On the one hand, 

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
this is the data structure of a raw data set including nested data structures and, on the other hand, 

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
the data types of the measured values. 

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
Entity Metadata – These are specifications of the sensor and the location where the sensor was 

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
installed. The specifications of a sensor include, for example, manufacturer ID, serial number, 

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
measurement accuracies, temperature working range and, for camera s, focal length, bend of the 

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
lens, and so far. The location where the sensor was installed is, for example, top, bottom, middle, 

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
front, back, and so far.

Ontology - A sensor data ontology is a formal description of sensor data to enable data exchange 

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
between multiple applications across different organizations with a common understanding of the 

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
structure and meaning of the information. Ontology is composed of Capability Metadata and Entity 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
Metadata. 

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
2.5.2.2 Ontology Characteristics 

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
A ontology is a formal representation and must have some structured form and hast to be machine 

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
readable. The ontology is an explicit description of a domain and is not like a natural language text 

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
description but is an enumeration of the entities that belong to th is domain and how they relate to 

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
each other.  

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
2.5.2.3 RDF and OQL Ontology Format  

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard 

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
originally designed as a data model for metadata. It has come to be used as a general method for 

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
description and exchange of graph data. RDF provides a variety of syntax notations and data 

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
serialization formats, with Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) currently being the most widely used 

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
notation.  

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
The W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich 

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. OWL is a 

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
computational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL c an be exploited by 

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
computer programs, e.g., to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge 

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
explicit. OWL documents, known as ontologies, can be published in the World Wide Web and may 

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
refer to or be referred from other OWL ontologies.  

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
2.5.2.4 Generation of Data Factory Sensor Ontologies 

--- Document Chunk 1261 ---
From the sensor data described in section 2.5.1 in total 37 ontologies were created for the cameras 

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
(camera, infrared camera and 5G camera), Lidars, Localization sensors ( GNSS and IMU), Gas- 

--- Document Chunk 1263 ---
Particle sensors and diagnosis data (Robot). Figure 12 shows the five steps how to derive a graphical 

--- Document Chunk 1264 ---
representation of the Ontology RDF model from the sensor data. The graphical representations are 

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
shown in the following sections. 

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
2.5.2.5 UML Model 

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
Figure 13 shows the abstract model of a sensor  in UML notation , which consists of the parts 

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
Message, Specification and Attachment.  

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
• Message is the data structure including the data types of the measured values. 

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
• Specification is the specification of the sensor, for example Vendor ID, serial number, 

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
measurement accuracies, and so far. If extensions or additions are attached to the sensor, 

--- Document Chunk 1281 ---
such as the camera lens, which has its own specification, it becomes an attachment. 

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
• Attachment is an extension or addition to the sensor and has its own specification. For 

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
example with the camera sensor, the lens with VendorID, serial number, focal length, 

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
aperture. 

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
A real sensor can be described exactly by instantiating the abstract model. 

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
Figure 13: UML Model of sensors 

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
2.5.3 Sensor Model 

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
A sensor has an entity map which describes all properties of the sensor and a capability map which 

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
comprises all the values from measuring. Figure 14 exemplarily represents the data model of a 

--- Document Chunk 1291 ---
camera sensor.

--- Document Chunk 1294 ---
2.5.3.1 Message 

--- Document Chunk 1295 ---
A message of a sensor is a container that contains the relevant data and metrics of a measurement 

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
(see Figure 15).

2.5.3.4 Localization sensor modality (GNSS/IMU) 

--- Document Chunk 1325 ---
The localization sensor modality delivers the horizontal localization information or position via GNSS 

--- Document Chunk 1326 ---
satellite positioning, as well as gyroscope and acceleration information via IMU . Strictly speaking, 

--- Document Chunk 1327 ---
this modality consists of a number of sensors  which are not explained in detail here , namely  

--- Document Chunk 1328 ---
BESTPOS, BESTUTM, BESTVEL, CORRIMU, GPSFix, HEADING2, IMU, INSPVA, INSPVAX, 

--- Document Chunk 1329 ---
INSSTDEV, NavSatFix. 

--- Document Chunk 1330 ---
Exemplarily we only consider BESTPOS and IMU sensor data here, which represents the horizontal 

--- Document Chunk 1331 ---
localization information and the gyroscope and acceleration information, the models can be specified 

--- Document Chunk 1332 ---

2.5.3.5 Lidar modality 

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
The Lidar modality consists of three long-range, one mid-range and two corner Lidars, and the long-

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
range lidar additionally has a built-in IMU. The model for the IMU can be found in Figure 20 und the 

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
model for the Lidars are de picted in Figure 21. The message holds a collection of N -dimensional 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---

2.5.5 Data Quality Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1422 ---
The Data Factory provides sensor data for the development and validation of machine learning 

--- Document Chunk 1423 ---
applications. In order to provide sensor data in a sufficient quality, the incoming sensor data already 

--- Document Chunk 1424 ---
need to fulfil a set of quality criteria. These criteria can only be satisfied by the onboard system that 

--- Document Chunk 1425 ---
produces the sensor data. The following Data Quality Requirements are therefore targeting the 

--- Document Chunk 1426 ---
onboard system that generates the sensor data and refer to it as the system under consideration 

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
(SuC). The requirements are structured thematically, starting with the requirement targeting the 

--- Document Chunk 1428 ---
sensor configuration. These requirements ensure that the configuration of the onboard system with 

--- Document Chunk 1429 ---
its sensors is known for each point in time. The second section about data integrity ensures the 

--- Document Chunk 1430 ---
integrity of the sensor data in the whole chain from the sensors to the Data Factory. That means that 

--- Document Chunk 1431 ---
the sensor data is not being modified or corrupted while being stored or transferred. The data content 

--- Document Chunk 1432 ---
section assures that all available sensor information is attached to the sensor data. The next three 

--- Document Chunk 1433 ---
sections target the multi -modal use of the sensor data and allows the synchro nisation of multiple 

--- Document Chunk 1434 ---
modalities. This includes requirements regarding time stamping, frequency and calibration of the 

--- Document Chunk 1435 ---
sensor data. The last two section target the ego-motion of the train. The GNSS and IMU information 

--- Document Chunk 1436 ---
section defines the required information to determine the position and motion of the train. The ego 

--- Document Chunk 1437 ---
motion compensation section defines requirements that allow to correct or minimize artefacts in the 

--- Document Chunk 1438 ---
sensor data that are introduced by the motion of the train during the acquisition of sensor data. 

--- Document Chunk 1439 ---
2.5.5.1 Sensor Configuration 

--- Document Chunk 1440 ---
• The SuC shall provide the sensor data in the Highest_Quality that is technically possible 

--- Document Chunk 1441 ---
without violating the system's performance requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1442 ---
o Rationale: The data shall be used for the development of GoA4 train operation. One 

--- Document Chunk 1443 ---
of the main use cases is the environmental perception with its multiple tasks. In order 

--- Document Chunk 1444 ---
to fulfil the requirements of these tasks, an overall high data quality is required. A goal 

--- Document Chunk 1445 ---
is the creation of multi -modal sensor datasets. This requires highly synchronised 

--- Document Chunk 1446 ---
sensor data with a precise calibration and sensor data that allows to detect and 

--- Document Chunk 1447 ---
recognise objects as good as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 1448 ---
• The SuC shall provide the sensor configuration and parameters for each Sensor_Frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1449 ---
o Rationale: The sensor configuration and parameters shall be provided so that each 

--- Document Chunk 1450 ---
Sensor_Frame can be associated with the respective sensor's configuration and 

--- Document Chunk 1451 ---
parameters. This is required in order to be able to evaluate sensor configurations and 

--- Document Chunk 1452 ---
compare different configuration. In addition, it helps to evaluate artefacts in the sensor 

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
data based on the configuration. For example, the rolling shutter effects depends on 

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
the exposure time. In order to track down errors, the serial numbers and software 

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
versions need to be known. 

--- Document Chunk 1456 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Hardware_Configuration for each Sensor_Frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1457 ---
o Rationale: Knowing the hardware configuration of the system is essential to detect 

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
misconfigured or faulty hardware components. Especially for the hardware 

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
configuration it is not necessary to physically attach it to each Sensor_Framebut 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
instead make transparent which Sensor_Frame are recorded with which hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Software_Versions for each Sensor_Frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
o Rationale: Knowing the software version of each software component in the system 

--- Document Chunk 1463 ---
is necessary to track down issues in specific versions of the software that are detected 

--- Document Chunk 1464 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1465 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1466 ---

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 44 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
when evaluating the quality of the sensor data. Similar to the hardware version it is 

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
not necessary to physically attach the software versions to each Sensor_Frame but 

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
instead make transparent which Sensor_Frame are recorded with which software 

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
versions. 

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Sensor_Parameters for each Sensor_Frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
o Rationale: Knowing the sensor parameters for each Sensor_Frameis necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
compare the sensor parameters at different environment conditions and evaluate the 

--- Document Chunk 1477 ---
effects of different sensor parameters on the data quality. For example, the exposure 

--- Document Chunk 1478 ---
time can influence the rolling shutter artefacts of a camera. 

--- Document Chunk 1479 ---
2.5.5.2 Data Integrity 

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
• The SuC shall provide the unmodified Sensor_Data_Streams to the Data_Logger for 

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
recording. 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
o Rationale: The Sensor_Frame shall not be modified by any subsystem in order to 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
avoid that other systems only having data in reduced quality. For certification of the 

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
system it is necessary to ensure that the data is not being modified. This includes that 

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
all Sensor_Frame are forwarded to the Data_Logger and no information is removed 

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
from the data. 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
• The SuC shall publish the Acquisition_Timestamp that is provided by the sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
o Rationale: The goal is to know the acquisition timestamp when the Sensor_Frame is 

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
physically being captured by the sensor. This requires to have a precisely 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---
synchronised sensor and that the timestamp provided by the sensor is not overridden 

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
with the timestamp when the sensor arrives at the driver or any other subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
• The SuC shall allow to verify the authenticity and integrity of each Sensor_Frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
o Rationale: It shall be possible to verify that the message is not being modified. This 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
verification shall be possible at each stage in the system and in the Data Factory. 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
Therefore, the SuC needs to add information to each message (or provide another 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
method) that allows to verify the integrity and authentication of each Sensor_Frame. 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
There might be sensors that do not support adding these information within the 

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
sensor. In these cases the information should be added at the earliest possible stage 

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
and resourc e demands and computation time may need to be considered and 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
weighted with the benefits of support an authenticity and integrity verification at that 

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
stage. 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
2.5.5.3 Data Content 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
• The SuC shall attach all information to each Sensor_Frame that are provided by the 

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
manufacturer's sensor driver. 

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
o Rationale: The Data_Logger shall be able to record all sensor information that is 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
available in the system unless technically infeasible. This means, that each sensor 

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
information that is available in the system shall arrive at the Data_Logger. 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
• The SuC shall make processed Sensor_Data_Stream available to the Data_Logger , if the 

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
processing adds information to the Sensor_Data_Stream. 

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1511 ---

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 45 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
o Rationale: In case sensor data is processed to improve its quality or to add additional 

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
information, the system shall be designed to enable the Data_Logger to record the 

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
processed as well as the unprocessed data streams, if technically feasible. 

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
2.5.5.4 Time Stamping 

--- Document Chunk 1520 ---
• The SuC shall stamp all Sensor_Frames with the Acquisition_Timestamp. 

--- Document Chunk 1521 ---
o Rationale: In order to precisely fuse frames that are recorded at the same / a similar 

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
point in time, the physical acquisition time is required. Sensor fusion will likely be a 

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
key concept for the environmental perception in GoA4 train operation and is required 

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
for multi-modal data annotation. 

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---
• The SuC shall provide a definition of what part of the sensor's actual physical acquisition 

--- Document Chunk 1526 ---
process the Acquisition_Timestamp is referring too. 

--- Document Chunk 1527 ---
o Rationale: Different sensors have different means of acquisition. In practice, 

--- Document Chunk 1528 ---
acquisition can have multiple possible reference or "anchor" points in time, each of 

--- Document Chunk 1529 ---
which might be equally appropriate, as long as it is clearly defined, which one is used. 

--- Document Chunk 1530 ---
Examples: For global shutter cameras, possible references are start time of exposure 

--- Document Chunk 1531 ---
or end time of exposure. For rolling shutter cameras, this shall additionally include the 

--- Document Chunk 1532 ---
line of reference, as different lines of a rolling shutter sensor are exposed at different 

--- Document Chunk 1533 ---
times. It shall also include the line time, i.e., the time delta between the exposure start 

--- Document Chunk 1534 ---
of successive lines. 

--- Document Chunk 1535 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Reference_Time for the system. 

--- Document Chunk 1536 ---
o Rationale: It is important to have the same understanding of time in the system in 

--- Document Chunk 1537 ---
order to fuse Sensor_Frames from different sensors to a Sensor_MFrame using the 

--- Document Chunk 1538 ---
acquisition time. 

--- Document Chunk 1539 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Reference_Time in UTC. 

--- Document Chunk 1540 ---
o Rationale: Avoid leap seconds errors in the data by configuring all systems to use 

--- Document Chunk 1541 ---
UTC instead of the atomic time. 

--- Document Chunk 1542 ---
• The SuC shall make the Reference_Time available within 30s after system boot is completed. 

--- Document Chunk 1543 ---
o Rationale: To allow all systems to synchronise their time within 60s after system boot 

--- Document Chunk 1544 ---
completed, the reference time has be available in advance. 

--- Document Chunk 1545 ---
• The SuC shall provide timing signals for clock synchronisation in the system. 

--- Document Chunk 1546 ---
o Rationale: The reference clocks has to provide a time synchronisation service with a 

--- Document Chunk 1547 ---
protocol. The most common one is PTP. 

--- Document Chunk 1548 ---
• The SuC shall ensure clocks deviate less than 1 ms from the Reference_Time. 

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
o Rationale: This is necessary to allow precise stamping of acquisition times and an 

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
accurate fusion of sensors. Common protocols such as PTP allow an accuracy up to 

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
less than a microsecond. 

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
• The SuC shall ensure clocks are synchronised to the Reference_Time within 60s after 

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---
system boot is completed. 

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
o Rationale: As one of the tasks in Data Factory is to ensure that the driving path is free 

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
before the train starts moving, the data while the train is still on the parking position 

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---

--- Document Chunk 1561 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 46 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1562 ---
is of interest. In order to capture and use this data, the reference time in the system 

--- Document Chunk 1563 ---
shall be available within 60s after the system boot is completed. 

--- Document Chunk 1564 ---
• The Acquisition_Timestamp shall deviate less than 1 ms from the physical acquisition time 

--- Document Chunk 1565 ---
of the sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1566 ---
o Rationale: In order to allow a precise fusion of sensor data, the acquisition timestamp 

--- Document Chunk 1567 ---
shall be as close as possible to the physical acquisition timestamp. The physical 

--- Document Chunk 1568 ---
acquisition time is the reference time in the the system at the point in time when the  

--- Document Chunk 1569 ---
hardware in the sensor registers the object. Common protocols such as PTP allow an 

--- Document Chunk 1570 ---
accuracy up to less than a microsecond. With a speed of 100km/h, the train moves 

--- Document Chunk 1571 ---
around 3cm per millisecond. 

--- Document Chunk 1572 ---
2.5.5.5 Frequency & Synchronisation 

--- Document Chunk 1573 ---
• The SuC shall ensure a stable and constant Acquisition_Frequency for each sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1574 ---
o Rationale: A stable and constant acquisition frequency is required to reliably produce 

--- Document Chunk 1575 ---
synchronised sensor data that can be fused. 

--- Document Chunk 1576 ---
• The SuC shall ensure that the Acquisition_Timestamps between two consecutive 

--- Document Chunk 1577 ---
Sensor_Frames have a maximum deviation of 5% or 2.5ms, whatever is lower, to the 

--- Document Chunk 1578 ---
expected delta which is calculated based on the target frequency (delta = 1/f). 

--- Document Chunk 1579 ---
o Rationale: This requirement defines the upper bounds for the requirement above by 

--- Document Chunk 1580 ---
providing concrete values for what is the lower bound for a stable and constant 

--- Document Chunk 1581 ---
acquisition frequency. In the extreme (on sensor is -2.5 ms and the other one is +2.5 

--- Document Chunk 1582 ---
ms) this leads to an offset of 5ms within a Sensor_MFrame. With a speed of 100km/h 

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
this will lead to an offset of 15cm in the worst case. 

--- Document Chunk 1584 ---
• The SuC shall ensure that each Perception_Sensor uses an Acquisition_Frequency that is 

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
an integer multiple of the Perception_Sensor with the lowest Acquisition_Frequency. 

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
o Rationale: This in mandatory in order to have multiple synchronised sensors with a 

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
stable and constant acquisition frequency. 

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
• The SuC shall ensure that the maximum percentage of Frame_Drops per 

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
Sensor_Data_Stream is lower than one per thousand (1/1000). 

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
o Rationale: This requirement tolerates one frame drop at a maximum occurrence of 

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
once every 1000 frames. 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
• The SuC shall ensure an Acquisition_Frequency of the Perception_Sensors of at least 10 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
Hz. 

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
o Rationale: A frequency of 10 Hz allows to reevaluate the situation every 100ms and 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
therefore 10 times a second. It is necessary to increase the accuracy of tracking 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
algorithms by limiting the distance the train and objects move between two frames. 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
• The SuC shall ensure an Acquisition_Frequency for the Coupled_Localisation of at least 50 

--- Document Chunk 1598 ---
Hz. 

--- Document Chunk 1599 ---
o Rationale: A high update frequency of the coupled localisation is important to get the 

--- Document Chunk 1600 ---
most accurate egomotion information for each sensor frame. As the coupled 

--- Document Chunk 1601 ---
localisation consists of multiple modalities, such as GNSS, IMU, map matched 

--- Document Chunk 1602 ---
localisation, not all modalities need to have an update frequency of 50 Hz. It is

--- Document Chunk 1609 ---
possible to update the position at 50 Hz using the IMU measurements and correct the 

--- Document Chunk 1610 ---
drift using GNSS position updates at a lower frequency. 

--- Document Chunk 1611 ---
• The SuC shall trigger the acquisition of the Perception_Sensors synchronously. 

--- Document Chunk 1612 ---
o Rationale: In order to fuse sensor modalities and create multi -modal frames 

--- Document Chunk 1613 ---
(Sensor_MFrames), all Perception_Sensors have to capture their data at the same 

--- Document Chunk 1614 ---
point in time. For technical reasons, there might be sensor modalities that benefit from 

--- Document Chunk 1615 ---
a slightly shift the acquisition time of these sensors to avoid artefacts (distortions), 

--- Document Chunk 1616 ---
such as, e.g. multiple RADARs. When having a setup with multiple RADAR sensors 

--- Document Chunk 1617 ---
it is common to trigger the central RADAR together with the other perception sensors 

--- Document Chunk 1618 ---
and shift the left and right RADARs slightly in terms of acquisition time to reduce 

--- Document Chunk 1619 ---
distortion by the FMCW ramp. 

--- Document Chunk 1620 ---
• The SuC shall allow a maximum difference between the Acquisition_Timestamps of the same 

--- Document Chunk 1621 ---
Sensor_MFrame of less than 5 ms for each Perception_Sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1622 ---
o Rationale: When the train or objects are in motion, a large time offset of the acquisition 

--- Document Chunk 1623 ---
time of different sensor modalities of the same Sensor_MFrame will introduce errors 

--- Document Chunk 1624 ---
in the sensor fusion. With a speed of 100km/h this will lead to an offset of 15cm in the 

--- Document Chunk 1625 ---
worst case. This requirement implies that all synchronously triggered sensors have 

--- Document Chunk 1626 ---
to trigger within a time period of 5 ms. 

--- Document Chunk 1627 ---
2.5.5.6 Sensor Calibration 

--- Document Chunk 1628 ---
• The SuC shall provide precise calibration information for each sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1629 ---
o Rationale: In order to fuse the output of different sensors, a precise calibration is 

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
necessary. In the context of the Data Factory this is for example necessary to create 

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
a multi-modal sensor dataset. 

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
• The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration for each sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
o Rationale: The extrinsic calibration parameters are required to get a precise overall 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
calibration. 

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
• The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration with an accuracy of at least 1 cm for each 

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
translational axis. 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
o Rationale: From the experience of different projects this is a good lower bound. This 

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
measurement accuracy is easily achievable and limits the effort during annotation. 

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
• The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration with an accuracy of at least 0.2° for each 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
rotational axis. 

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
o Rationale: From the experience of different projects this is a good lower bound. 

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
Rotational inaccuracy leads to an increasing positional error with increasing distance 

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
from the train. This measurement accuracy is easily achievable and limits the effort 

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
during annotation. Calculation for error with 0.2°: 100m * tan(0.2°) ≈ 0,35m which is 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
already a lot of offset for multi-modal annotation. 

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
• The SuC shall provide the intrinsic calibration for each sensor that uses intrinsic calibration 

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
o Rationale: The intrinsic calibration parameters are required to get a precise overall 

--- Document Chunk 1649 ---
calibration.

2.5.5.7 GNSS and IMU Information 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
• The SuC shall provide precise GNSS and IMU information for a specified reference point. 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
o Rationale: The position of the train is required for various use cases. In terms of data 

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
annotation it is required to match the position of the train on the digital map. Precise 

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
IMU information is required to perform egomotion compensation. GNSS and IMU 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
information are used to generate metadata to search for specific scenarios such as 

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
the train being at a specific area (geofence), the train drives below/above/within a 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
specific speed or accelerates below/above/with a specific threshold. 

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
• The SuC shall provide the GNSS position in WGS84 with the following values and units. 

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
▪ latitude [deg] 

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
▪ longitude [deg] 

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
▪ height/altitude [m] 

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
▪ In case the values and units differ from the required, the steps and equations 

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
on how to convert to the required values and units shall be provided. 

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---
o Rationale: The GNSS position is required to match the sensor data with the digital 

--- Document Chunk 1671 ---
map. Providing localisation information in standardised format simplifies the 

--- Document Chunk 1672 ---
processing of the data and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The position of the 

--- Document Chunk 1673 ---
train is used to generate metadata that allow to search for data at a specific area 

--- Document Chunk 1674 ---
(geofence). 

--- Document Chunk 1675 ---
• The SuC shall provide the GNSS velocity in the ENU reference system with the following 

--- Document Chunk 1676 ---
values and units. 

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
▪ east velocity [m/s] 

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
▪ north velocity [m/s] 

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
▪ and up velocity [m/s] 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
▪ In case the values and units differ from the required, the steps and equations 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
on how to convert to the required values and units shall be provided. 

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
o Rationale:  The velocity of the train is required for egomotion compensation. Providing 

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---
localisation information in standardised format simplifies the processing of the data 

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The velocity is used to generate metada ta 

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
that allow the user to search for data at which the train is driving above/below/within 

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
a specific velocity threshold. 

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
• The SuC shall provide the IMU sensor orientation according to the right -hand-rule with the 

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
following values and units. The orientation angles shall follow the roll -pitch-yaw Tait-Bryan 

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
convention: z-y'-x'' (intrinsic) or x-y-z (extrinsic) according to DIN 70000. 

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
▪ roll [rad] in body frame according to DIN 70000 (x forward, y to the left, z up) 

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
▪ pitch [rad] in body frame according to DIN 70000 (x forward, y to the left, z up) 

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
▪ yaw [rad] in ENU coordinate system (with 0 = east) 

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
▪ In case the values and units differ from the required, the steps and equations 

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
on how to convert to the required values and units shall be provided.

FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 49 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1701 ---
o Rationale: The sensor orientation is required for egomotion compensation. Providing 

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
localisation information in standardised format simplifies the processing of the data 

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The orientation is used to generate 

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
metadata that allow the user to search for data at which the train is driving in a specific 

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
direction (e.g. to evaluate the effects of specific sun angles in relation to the driving 

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
direction of the train). 

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
• The SuC shall provide the IMU sensor orientation rate with the following values and units. 

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
▪ roll rate [rad/sample] 

--- Document Chunk 1709 ---
▪ pitch rate [rad/sample] 

--- Document Chunk 1710 ---
▪ yaw rate [rad/sample] 

--- Document Chunk 1711 ---
▪ In case the values and units differ from the required, the steps and equations 

--- Document Chunk 1712 ---
on how to convert to the required values and units shall be provided. 

--- Document Chunk 1713 ---
o Rationale: The sensor orientation rate is required for precise egomotion 

--- Document Chunk 1714 ---
compensation. Providing localisation information in standardised format simplifies the 

--- Document Chunk 1715 ---
processing of the data and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.  

--- Document Chunk 1716 ---
• The SuC shall provide the INS acceleration with the following values and units 

--- Document Chunk 1717 ---
▪ lateral acceleration [m/s/sample] (along x-axis)  

--- Document Chunk 1718 ---
▪ longitudinal acceleration [m/s/sample] (along y-axis) 

--- Document Chunk 1719 ---
▪ vertical acceleration [m/s/sample] (along z-axis) 

--- Document Chunk 1720 ---
▪ In case the values and units differ from the required, the steps and equations 

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
on how to convert to the required values and units shall be provided. 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
o Rationale: The INS acceleration is required for precise egomotion compensation. 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
Providing localisation information in standardised format simplifies the processing of 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
the data and reduces the risk of misinterpretation. The acceleration is used to 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
generate metadata that allow the user to search for data at which the train is 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
accelerating/braking above/below/within a specific threshold (e.g. to identify situation 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
where the train is braking). 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
• The SuC shall ensure a precision of the train localisation of at least 30cm. 

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
o Rationale: A precise train localisation is required in order to be able match the sensor 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
data with the digital map. GNSS precision will be limited within tunnels and it shall be 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
determined if map matched localisation can compensate in those situations or i f the 

--- Document Chunk 1732 ---
precision can be worse in areas with limited GNSS connection. 

--- Document Chunk 1733 ---
2.5.5.8 Ego-Motion Compensation 

--- Document Chunk 1734 ---
• The SuC shall provide ego -motion compensated or ego -motion compensable sensor data 

--- Document Chunk 1735 ---
using the provided Egomotion information. 

--- Document Chunk 1736 ---
o Rationale: In order to use the sensor data for annotation and object fusion tasks, the 

--- Document Chunk 1737 ---
LiDAR point clouds likely need to be ego -motion compensated. Therefore, the 

--- Document Chunk 1738 ---
information to perform this compensation must be available. 

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
• The SuC shall provide the ego -motion compensated sensor data for recording to the 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
Data_Logger, if available. 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 50 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
o Rationale: If there is a real-time ego-motion compensation performed, the results shall 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
be available for the Data Logger 

--- Document Chunk 1749 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Acquisition_Timestamp for each point within the point cloud. 

--- Document Chunk 1750 ---
o Rationale: This is often implemented by providing the offset of each point to the 

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
acquisition timestamp of the point cloud. It is necessary to apply ego -motion 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
compensation to point clouds and avoid objects that are stretched in driving direction 

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
• The SuC shall provide the Egomotion information at the mounting position of each LiDAR 

--- Document Chunk 1755 ---
Perception_Sensor. 

--- Document Chunk 1756 ---
o Rationale: In order to have an accurate egomotion estimation for egomotion 

--- Document Chunk 1757 ---
compensation of the LiDAR point clouds. The egomotion shall either be measured at 

--- Document Chunk 1758 ---
the positions of the LiDARs or measured at a reference position that allows to 

--- Document Chunk 1759 ---
calculate the egomotion at th e positions of the LiDARs with a comparable precision 

--- Document Chunk 1760 ---
by providing the necessary transformation information. 

--- Document Chunk 1761 ---
• The SuC shall reduce the rolling shutter effect for cameras with a rolling shutter to a minimal 

--- Document Chunk 1762 ---
level. 

--- Document Chunk 1763 ---
o Rationale: The rolling shutter effect introduces distortion (curvature) of objects. This 

--- Document Chunk 1764 ---
reduces the precision of sensor fusion and increases the difficulty and effort for data 

--- Document Chunk 1765 ---
annotation. It also introduces risks for matching objects to the digital map and 

--- Document Chunk 1766 ---
detecting changes in the environment compared to the digital map. 

--- Document Chunk 1767 ---
• The SuC shall ensure that the curvature of objects is less than 2° for speeds up to 100 km/h 

--- Document Chunk 1768 ---
compared to the object recorded with a steady train. 

--- Document Chunk 1769 ---
o Rationale: A big distortion of objects makes it difficult to fuse objects between different 

--- Document Chunk 1770 ---
sensors as the appearance and geometries of this objects differ. The example image 

--- Document Chunk 1771 ---
(Figure 1 - in the document below) shows the effects of an angle of 4.5°. The distortion 

--- Document Chunk 1772 ---
of the rolling shutter effect is always a trade -off with the exposure time. It might be 

--- Document Chunk 1773 ---
necessary to exceed the distortion limit in situations of low light. 

--- Document Chunk 1774 ---
2.5.6 Data Annotation Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1775 ---
The ensuing section delineates the format for annotating the dataset. Detailed information is 

--- Document Chunk 1776 ---
systematically organized in Appendix 4.1, which readers are encouraged to consult for 

--- Document Chunk 1777 ---
comprehensive understanding. 

--- Document Chunk 1778 ---
Context of Machine Learning Annotations: In machine learning contexts, annotations are 

--- Document Chunk 1779 ---
indispensable for preparing datasets that machine learning algorithms can efficiently interpret. These 

--- Document Chunk 1780 ---
annotations encapsulate critical information regarding elements within data, such as the identification 

--- Document Chunk 1781 ---
and classification of objects in imagery. Typically, this intricate process is carried out by trained 

--- Document Chunk 1782 ---
annotators whose task is to ensure that the scenario depicted in the data is rendered comprehensible 

--- Document Chunk 1783 ---
for the algorithm. This document sets forth the requisite guidelines for annotating a variety of sensor 

--- Document Chunk 1784 ---
modalities, including but not limited to IR/RGB cameras, RADAR, and LiDAR. The specification 

--- Document Chunk 1785 ---
herein describes distinct annotation types applicable to each sensor modality. 

--- Document Chunk 1786 ---

static. Additionally, a subset of objects pertinent to railway operations has been identified, with a 

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
selection tailored to reflect real -world interactions and their potential implications for railwa y safety 

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
and operation. 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
Annotatable Entities and Artifacts: The dataset encompasses a diversified array of entities and

attributes that furnish additional details, enhancing the dataset's richness and utility for algorithm 

--- Document Chunk 1850 ---
training. These attributes elucidate properties such as object dimensions, orientation, and context -

2.5.8 Data Governance 

--- Document Chunk 1885 ---
Data Governance is the collective term for the practices, processes, and frameworks that ensure the 

--- Document Chunk 1886 ---
effective and responsible management of an organization’s data assets. It involves the clarity of 

--- Document Chunk 1887 ---
roles, decision rights, and accountability, ensuring that data is used both efficiently and securely. 

--- Document Chunk 1888 ---
The primary aim is to create a well-structured environment where data quality, accessibility, integrity, 

--- Document Chunk 1889 ---
and security are always maintained. See the related section of the CEF2 project in [6] and [7]. 

--- Document Chunk 1890 ---
2.5.8.1 Governance Policies and Automation 

--- Document Chunk 1891 ---
Governance within the context of a Data Factory involves establishing clear policies and procedures 

--- Document Chunk 1892 ---
to guide all data-related activities. It entails setting up roles like Data Owners, Data Stewards, and 

--- Document Chunk 1893 ---
Data Consumers, each with specific responsibilities t o ensure that data is handled correctly 

--- Document Chunk 1894 ---
throughout its lifecycle. Governance covers everything from how data is collected and stored, to how 

--- Document Chunk 1895 ---
it is archived or purged. Effective governance means that all data handling is transparent, 

--- Document Chunk 1896 ---
predictable, and in line with established rules. 

--- Document Chunk 1897 ---
• Define Purge Policy 

--- Document Chunk 1898 ---
o Define Purge Policy

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
activities, including access, modification, and deletion. This includes system 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
data, error logging and access logging.

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---
Rationale: This is done in order to ensure all data-related activities on the 

--- Document Chunk 1917 ---
system follow the requirements of protection and data governance. 

--- Document Chunk 1918 ---
o Log Analysis 

--- Document Chunk 1919 ---
▪ Logs shall capture user IDs, timestamps, and actions performed to facilitate 

--- Document Chunk 1920 ---
forensic analysis.

--- Document Chunk 1924 ---
▪ The system shall define and enforce data governance policies, including 

--- Document Chunk 1925 ---
adherence to data classification, access controls, and quality standards. 

--- Document Chunk 1926 ---
Rationale: In order to make sure the principles of data governance are 

--- Document Chunk 1927 ---
being fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 1928 ---
o Define Policy Alerts 

--- Document Chunk 1929 ---
▪ Policy violations should trigger alerts and notifications to appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1930 ---
stakeholders. 

--- Document Chunk 1931 ---
Rationale: In order to ensure the right measures are taken to avoid 

--- Document Chunk 1932 ---
consequences and restore policies. 

--- Document Chunk 1933 ---
• Governance Roles 

--- Document Chunk 1934 ---
o Roles for every object 

--- Document Chunk 1935 ---
▪ Every object and every subsystem of DAFA shall have a Data Owner, Data 

--- Document Chunk 1936 ---
Steward and Data Consumer. 

--- Document Chunk 1937 ---
Rationale: In order to ensure the modification of data follows the principles 

--- Document Chunk 1938 ---
of data governance. 

--- Document Chunk 1939 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1940 ---
2.5.8.2 Compliance 

--- Document Chunk 1941 ---
Compliance, refers to adhering to laws, regulations, and policies that apply to data. For Data Factory, 

--- Document Chunk 1942 ---
this means meeting the requirements of GDPRand other data protection regulations. Compliance 

--- Document Chunk 1943 ---
ensures that the Data Factory operates legally and ethically, respecting the privacy and rights of 

--- Document Chunk 1944 ---
individuals. Regular auditing and reporting are part of this, ensuring that the system continually 

--- Document Chunk 1945 ---
meets these external standards 

--- Document Chunk 1946 ---
In order to maintain a suitable balance of interest between data processing entities and data owners, 

--- Document Chunk 1947 ---
GDPR implements a negotiation-based approach which aims at including all relevant interests by 

--- Document Chunk 1948 ---
different stakeholder groups into a compromise solution fitting for all of them. 

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
In order to do so in the context of GoA4 development in the rail sector, these groups firstly have to 

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
be identified. Afterwards the possibly revealed personally identifiable information (PII) has to be 

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 55 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
determined and a risk analysis /balance w.r.t. the legitimate interests of a rail way undertaking 

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
developing GoA4 trains has to be done. 

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
Analysis of people affected: Relevant groups are  

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
• rail customers (e.g. on platforms) 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
• rail service employees (in the trackbed or on platforms)  

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
• 3rd party individuals, e.g. people in the general public being visible while a train passes on a 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
track next to them.  This also refers to e.g. parked cars of which the license plate could be 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
visible by a camera on the train. 

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
Risk analysis for people affected:  The data protection risk for individuals can generally be 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
considered low. The potential risks associated with the processing of personal data, such as 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
discrimination, identity theft, financial losses, and reputational damage, can be entirely or at least 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
largely excluded here. Effects of processing the relevant data on the affected individuals are minimal 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
overall.  

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---
From the perspective of the affected individuals, the content and significance of the camera images, 

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
insofar as any personal data can be recognized on them, are minimal in relation to the actual purpose 

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
of processing these images using algorithms and thus their conversion into a machine -readable 

--- Document Chunk 1975 ---
environmental representation.  

--- Document Chunk 1976 ---
This is especially valid for cameras attached to the front of trains because these cover a limited area 

--- Document Chunk 1977 ---
surrounding the vehicle, there are no audio recordings or live transmissions of the data . The 

--- Document Chunk 1978 ---
recordings are thus limited in scope and functionality to what is necessary for creating environmental 

--- Document Chunk 1979 ---
representations, obstacle detection, and collision avoidance. 

--- Document Chunk 1980 ---
Access to the stored data must be kept strictly limited to a few authorized individuals and is controlled 

--- Document Chunk 1981 ---
with an access authorization concept within the implemented technical and organizational measures 

--- Document Chunk 1982 ---
(see below). An identification of individuals in the data is not necessary for GoA4 development and 

--- Document Chunk 1983 ---
should thus be excluded during data processing. Data containing personal content must generally 

--- Document Chunk 1984 ---
be deleted after the end of the development (achieving the purpose of development). However, some 

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
data might have to be kept for safety audits/safety argumentation according to the respective norms.  

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
Balance of interests between stakeholders: 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
• Rail customers and people on a platform or other railway areas are usually already subject 

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
to video surveillance measures to ensure their safety. They are informed by respective 

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
posters or signs and accept these recordings as a part of their travel. The video surveillance 

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
recordings are mostly long-term recordings, potentially live-viewed and cover the whole area 

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
of a train station or railway area . It can thus be concluded that an additional (very short!) 

--- Document Chunk 1993 ---
recording by camera on a train passing  a platform do es not constitute a huge change or 

--- Document Chunk 1994 ---
additional risk for a customer. 

--- Document Chunk 1995 ---
• Individuals in the trackbed can be considered employees of a rail company or a contractor 

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
because due to safety requirements, areas around tracks are not public a nd may not be 

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
accessed by 3rd party individuals. Therefore, the focus on data protection needs here can be 

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
seen with this employee/employer relationship in mind. It is thus important to integrate all 

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---

--- Document Chunk 2004 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 56 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
relevant committees (e.g. workers’ council, labour unions etc.) in the definition of a suitable 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
data protection process to ensure compliance and acceptance.  

--- Document Chunk 2007 ---
While it can e.g. be assumed that persons working in a track bed have an inherent interest 

--- Document Chunk 2008 ---
that an automated GoA4 train is able to detect them and brake accordingly, another point in 

--- Document Chunk 2009 ---
this discussion could be the employer’s duty of care to ensure a safe and riskless work 

--- Document Chunk 2010 ---
environment. Considering these arguments (and many more  depending on the specific 

--- Document Chunk 2011 ---
implementation of a project! ) on the table, it can be assumed that a suitable solution in 

--- Document Chunk 2012 ---
compliance with GDPR can be negotiated between the stakeholder  groups of a railway 

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
undertaking company.  It could e.g. be a solution to only anonymize employees of the 

--- Document Chunk 2014 ---
company in certain areas while the data from other areas remains unchanged or to limit the 

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
data usage in other ways.  

--- Document Chunk 2016 ---
However, these considerations cannot be done generally but only within the scope of a 

--- Document Chunk 2017 ---
specific project and development. 

--- Document Chunk 2018 ---
• 3rd party individuals could be affected by recordings when the train runs close to public areas 

--- Document Chunk 2019 ---
such as roads, level crossings etc. It can again be assumed that on the one hand, public area 

--- Document Chunk 2020 ---
are often subject to video surveillance measures and also the recording on -board the train 

--- Document Chunk 2021 ---
will most likely only be very short and not capturing a longer trajectory or path of a person. 

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
Also e.g. license plates visible in public areas are a common thing and are not considered 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
an additional risk if they appear on a video recording.  Limiting access to the data and not 

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
using it for identification of individuals is a natural requirement here which should not interfere 

--- Document Chunk 2025 ---
with the needs for development of a GoA4 train. 

--- Document Chunk 2026 ---
• On the other hand, r ailway undertaking s (and their research & development partners) 

--- Document Chunk 2027 ---
interested in GoA4 development also have legitimate interests to develop such systems. In 

--- Document Chunk 2028 ---
order to extend their business and make it sustainable for the future, they have a legitimate 

--- Document Chunk 2029 ---
interest to focus on new technologies and implement them for their business. These needs 

--- Document Chunk 2030 ---
can be assumed to be aggravated e.g. by the climate crisis and related interest to focus on 

--- Document Chunk 2031 ---
climate-friendly traffic technologies or also by a lack of train drivers that e.g. DB expects for 

--- Document Chunk 2032 ---
the future. 

--- Document Chunk 2033 ---
The general public is also expected to benefit from the development of GoA4 trains as e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---
an increased level of service, higher punctuality and more advantages are expected with 

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
GoA4 automation of railways as well as an overall technology development in Europe which 

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
is favourable for further future developments. All the aforementioned points are expected to 

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
constitute very important interests in favour of developing GoA4 technologies. 

--- Document Chunk 2038 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2039 ---
Expected technical/organisation measures to be taken according to GDPR:  While the exact 

--- Document Chunk 2040 ---
measures to be taken for ensuring a suitable balance of interest regarding privacy must be defined 

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
according to a specific project need, we want to outline at least a few general remarks in this 

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
document:  

--- Document Chunk 2043 ---
• Persons affected must be informed about potential video recordings. This can e.g. happen 

--- Document Chunk 2044 ---
using respective signs or posters once people enter an area in which the recording could 

--- Document Chunk 2045 ---
take place and must meet the respective GPRD requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 2046 ---
• Generally, it has to be said that the occurrence of obstacles around rail tracks appears rare 

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
during a train ride as trains are one of the safest measures of transport. The events of interest 

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
during the processing are thus sparse and require larger times of recording, but on the other 

--- Document Chunk 2049 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2050 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2051 ---
 Contract No. HE – 101102001 

--- Document Chunk 2052 ---

--- Document Chunk 2054 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 57 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 2055 ---
hand, much data can also be deleted after processing if it is identified to be less relevant. 

--- Document Chunk 2056 ---
Therefore, a suitable selection and prioritization procedure is recommended as it can support 

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---
the removal of irrelevant data and only data containing interesting events can be kept.  

--- Document Chunk 2058 ---
It should be noted that only a triggerless, indiscriminatory recording enables the recording of 

--- Document Chunk 2059 ---
data for detection of obstacles during operation. If the scope is restricted, for example through 

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
anonymization or limitation of the range or the field of view of the cameras, there is a 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
significant risk that the obstacle detection will be limited in its development and later may not 

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
reliably detect people in certain situations and trigger an automated emergency braking. 

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---
• Anonymization of data is generally not possible. An anonymization would adversely affect 

--- Document Chunk 2064 ---
the training and evaluation of algorithms for the detection and classification of persons and 

--- Document Chunk 2065 ---
objects, compromising the achievement of the development goals.  

--- Document Chunk 2066 ---
The reasons for this are: 

--- Document Chunk 2067 ---
o Reduced image quality: Anonymization techniques often involve blurring or pixelating 

--- Document Chunk 2068 ---
parts of images containing personal information, which can affect image quality. This 

--- Document Chunk 2069 ---
impairment can impact the ability of image recognition and object detection algorithms 

--- Document Chunk 2070 ---
to accurately recognize and analyze visual features, leading to suboptimal 

--- Document Chunk 2071 ---
performance.  

--- Document Chunk 2072 ---
o Loss of context: Anonymization techniques can remove or alter context -related 

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
information in images. Example techniques include removing objects or parts of 

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
objects (e.g., blackening faces). Furthermore, the environment surrounding the 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
objects might also b e altered. This loss of context can affect the ability of image 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
recognition algorithms to correctly understand and interpret the visual data.  

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
o Possible bias and generalization problems: Anonymization can create bias that 

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
affects the ability of image recognition algorithms to generalize from training data to 

--- Document Chunk 2079 ---
real-world scenarios. For example, if certain facial features are consistently covered, 

--- Document Chunk 2080 ---
the algorithm may struggle to recognize or classify individuals with similarly covered 

--- Document Chunk 2081 ---
features. 

--- Document Chunk 2082 ---
o Replacing personal data is problematic because, for instance, "replacement faces" 

--- Document Chunk 2083 ---
must represent a realistic image of all recorded individuals. This includes 

--- Document Chunk 2084 ---
characteristics such as gender, skin colour, and age. However, evaluating precisely 

--- Document Chunk 2085 ---
these characteristics requires processing special categories of personal data 

--- Document Chunk 2086 ---
according to Article 9 of the GDPR. 

--- Document Chunk 2087 ---
Although a general anonymization is not feasible, in the specific project setting, 

--- Document Chunk 2088 ---
anonymization should of course be implemented where possible. 

--- Document Chunk 2089 ---
• Storing of data should be done with the homologation procedure in mind. Although there is 

--- Document Chunk 2090 ---
not yet a clear path on homologation of GoA4 systems, it is likely that regulation will require 

--- Document Chunk 2091 ---
all data used during the development to be stored for future reference  or audits in case of 

--- Document Chunk 2092 ---
potential safety issues. The data to be stored for such longer times must be selected carefully 

--- Document Chunk 2093 ---
and the process must be accompanied by data protection experts to ensure compliance to 

--- Document Chunk 2094 ---
both technical norms and GDPR. 

--- Document Chunk 2095 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2096 ---
With these measures taken and a careful , considerate approach implemented together with close 

--- Document Chunk 2097 ---
collaboration by data protection experts and authorities, we conclude that the development of GoA4

Regulatory Compliance 

--- Document Chunk 2107 ---
o Data protection and privacy compliance 

--- Document Chunk 2108 ---
▪ The system shall implement measures ensuring compliance with GDPR, 

--- Document Chunk 2109 ---
including technical and organizational safeguards such as pseudonymization, 

--- Document Chunk 2110 ---
encryption, and access controls. A Data Protection Impact Assessment 

--- Document Chunk 2111 ---
(DPIA) shall be performed for all systems processing PII.. 

--- Document Chunk 2112 ---
Rationale: In order to ensure the regulations are followed. 

--- Document Chunk 2113 ---
o Define Compliance Auditing Periods 

--- Document Chunk 2114 ---
▪ Regular audits shall be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance, and reports 

--- Document Chunk 2115 ---
should be generated for regulatory reporting. 

--- Document Chunk 2116 ---
Rationale: In order to ensure the rules of compliance are followed. 

--- Document Chunk 2117 ---
2.5.8.3 Data Security 

--- Document Chunk 2118 ---
Data Security is a key component of Data Governance, comprising the tools and methods used to 

--- Document Chunk 2119 ---
protect data from unauthorized access or breaches. This encompasses security protocols for data 

--- Document Chunk 2120 ---
at rest and in transit, such as encryption, and measures to prevent data leaks or theft. Security is a 

--- Document Chunk 2121 ---
proactive stance to guard the organization's most valuable asset - its data. 

--- Document Chunk 2122 ---
• Define Security Protocols 

--- Document Chunk 2123 ---
o Unauthorized Access Protection 

--- Document Chunk 2124 ---
▪ Security protocols and standards shall be followed to protect against 

--- Document Chunk 2125 ---
unauthorized access and data breaches. 

--- Document Chunk 2126 ---
Rationale: In order to ensure the security according to accepted 

--- Document Chunk 2127 ---
standards.  

--- Document Chunk 2128 ---
• Data Encryption 

--- Document Chunk 2129 ---
o Data Encryption Mechanisms. 

--- Document Chunk 2130 ---
▪ The system shall implement encryption mechanisms for data in transit and at 

--- Document Chunk 2131 ---
rest. 

--- Document Chunk 2132 ---
Rationale: In order to avoid unauthorized access to protected data. 

--- Document Chunk 2133 ---
2.5.8.4 User Training and Documentation 

--- Document Chunk 2134 ---
User Training and Documentation are the final pillars of robust Data Governance. By providing 

--- Document Chunk 2135 ---
comprehensive training and clear documentation, stakeholders are made aware of the governance 

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
policies, compliance obligations, and security protocols. This train ing is crucial for ensuring that 

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
everyone who interacts with the system understands their role in safeguarding data. 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
• Applicable User Training 

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
o Training Materials 

--- Document Chunk 2140 ---
▪ The system shall provide user training materials and documentation to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 2141 ---
that stakeholders understand and adhere to data governance policies.

o Information about Updates 

--- Document Chunk 2152 ---
▪ Regular training sessions shall be conducted for users. 

--- Document Chunk 2153 ---
Rationale: In order to stay informed about updates and best practices. 

--- Document Chunk 2154 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2155 ---
In DAFA, governance, compliance, and security are not just operational requirements; they are 

--- Document Chunk 2156 ---
commitments to excellence in data management, forming the bedrock of trust and operational 

--- Document Chunk 2157 ---
efficiency. 

--- Document Chunk 2158 ---
2.6 SYSTEM 

--- Document Chunk 2159 ---
In order to specify the system and derive the architecture, the stakeholder needs were collected and 

--- Document Chunk 2160 ---
put into a standardised notation (section  2.6.1) and the system description can be found in the 

--- Document Chunk 2161 ---
following section 2.6.3. 

--- Document Chunk 2162 ---
Section 2.6.2  lists the system security requirements, that are derived from security standards. Parts 

--- Document Chunk 2163 ---
of these requirements leads to functional security requirement in the respective subsystem (section 

--- Document Chunk 2164 ---
2.7.9). 

--- Document Chunk 2165 ---
2.6.1 Stakeholder Needs 

--- Document Chunk 2166 ---
In this section, the needs of the stakeholder are listed by the respective actor or connected system 

--- Document Chunk 2167 ---
in the respective sub -groups. The stakeholder needs are derived from a demand, a necessity of 

--- Document Chunk 2168 ---
personas and/or entities, which will raise expectations for t he system to be operated. In total, the 

--- Document Chunk 2169 ---
system Data Factory provides the actors to the system with the underlying entities such as Onboard 

--- Document Chunk 2170 ---
Data, Testing Data, Data, Data Factory Operation and invoice creation, Customers and Data Factory 

--- Document Chunk 2171 ---
Teams.  

--- Document Chunk 2172 ---
Subsequently, the addressed needs are grouped into the Stakeholder Laboratory, Train Onboard 

--- Document Chunk 2173 ---
System, Train Onboard System, External Data Factories, Data Factory Operator, Customer and 

--- Document Chunk 2174 ---
Data Factory Teams.

--- Document Chunk 2197 ---
o Rational: in order to operate the Data Factory economically. 

--- Document Chunk 2198 ---
• As a Data Factory Operator, I need industry partners to develop their machine learning 

--- Document Chunk 2199 ---
models for GoA4 operation within the Data Factory. 

--- Document Chunk 2200 ---
o Rational: in order to keep sovereignty over my sensor data and allow all partners to 

--- Document Chunk 2201 ---

2.6.2 System Security Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 2405 ---
In the context of the R2DATO project, the security of the system and its data is paramount in ensuring 

--- Document Chunk 2406 ---
the integrity and reliability of the Data Factory. The System Security Requirements are designed to 

--- Document Chunk 2407 ---
safeguard both the system and its data against a myriad of threats emanating from the environment. 

--- Document Chunk 2408 ---
These threats can be both intentional, such as hacking or theft, and accidental, such as malfunctions 

--- Document Chunk 2409 ---
or natural disasters. 

--- Document Chunk 2410 ---
The System Security segment is dedicated to outlining the necessary defences and protocols to 

--- Document Chunk 2411 ---
maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data. These elements are 

--- Document Chunk 2412 ---
crucial in mitigating the risk of operational disruptions, financial losses, and potential safety impacts 

--- Document Chunk 2413 ---
on stakeholders. Our approach is aligned with best practices and standards, including the adoption 

--- Document Chunk 2414 ---
of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001 [18] and a 

--- Document Chunk 2415 ---
risk-based security management strategy guided by ISO 27002 [19] controls. 

--- Document Chunk 2416 ---
Furthermore, considering the Data Factory's pivotal role in developing algorithms for future railway 

--- Document Chunk 2417 ---
systems, we integrate security principles from the IEC 62443 [20] standard, which focuses on 

--- Document Chunk 2418 ---
industrial automation and control systems. This section elucid ates our commitment to technical 

--- Document Chunk 2419 ---
security measures while assuming operational security is managed by the Data Factory operator, 

--- Document Chunk 2420 ---
who also provides essential security services such as asset management and network security. 

--- Document Chunk 2421 ---
The System Security Requirements are structured to address various aspects of security, aiming to 

--- Document Chunk 2422 ---
ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data. Here is an overview 

--- Document Chunk 2423 ---
of the structure based on the details provided: 

--- Document Chunk 2424 ---
2.6.2.1 Technical Security Measures 

--- Document Chunk 2425 ---
• Identity and Access Management: Ensuring only authorized users can access the system. 

--- Document Chunk 2426 ---
• Privileged Access Management: Special controls for users with elevated access rights. 

--- Document Chunk 2427 ---
• Data Confidentiality: Protecting data from unauthorized access and disclosure. 

--- Document Chunk 2428 ---
• System Integrity: Ensuring data and system functionality are not improperly modified. 

--- Document Chunk 2429 ---
• System Availability: Ensuring the system is accessible and usable when needed. 

--- Document Chunk 2430 ---
• System Hardening: Implementing measures to reduce system vulnerabilities. 

--- Document Chunk 2431 ---
• Asset and Patch Management: Keeping software updated and managing hardware assets. 

--- Document Chunk 2432 ---
• Backup and Restore: Ensuring data can be recovered in the event of loss or corruption. 

--- Document Chunk 2433 ---
• Logging and Monitoring: Keeping records of system activities for security analysis. 

--- Document Chunk 2434 ---

--- Document Chunk 2440 ---
• Network Security: Protecting the system from network-based threats. 

--- Document Chunk 2441 ---
• Physical Security: Preventing unauthorized physical access to system components. 

--- Document Chunk 2442 ---
2.6.2.2 General non-functional system security requirements 

--- Document Chunk 2443 ---
The following three requirements consider the three primary goals of security confidentiality, integrity 

--- Document Chunk 2444 ---
and availability. The general approach to ensure security within a system is to ensure that a loss of 

--- Document Chunk 2445 ---
these goals is avoided based on a risk management approach. Especially that means that an 

--- Document Chunk 2446 ---
acceptable level of risk has to be defined and that all risks do not exceed this risk level. 

--- Document Chunk 2447 ---
The Data Factory shall ensure that the risk of a los s of confidentiality is acceptable according to 

--- Document Chunk 2448 ---
internal and external regulations. 

--- Document Chunk 2449 ---
Confidentiality is one of the primary goals of security and risks have to be acceptable. 

--- Document Chunk 2450 ---
The Data Factory shall ensure that the risk of a lost of integrity  is acceptable according to internal 

--- Document Chunk 2451 ---
and external regulations. 

--- Document Chunk 2452 ---
Integrity is one of the primary goals of security and risks have to be acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 2453 ---
The Data Factory shall ensure that the risk of a lost of availability is acceptable according to internal 

--- Document Chunk 2454 ---
and external regulations. 

--- Document Chunk 2455 ---
Availability is one of the primary goals of security and risks have to be acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 2456 ---
2.6.2.3 System security requirements derived from IEC 62443-3-3

2.7 SUBSYSTEMS 

--- Document Chunk 2823 ---
The subsystems constitute the foundational elements of our Data Factory, serving as critical 

--- Document Chunk 2824 ---
components that underpin the operational framework and enable the realization of the system's 

--- Document Chunk 2825 ---
overarching functionality. Each subsystem is designed to fulfil a specific set of roles within the larger 

--- Document Chunk 2826 ---
ecosystem, functioning as an integral piece of the puzzle that drives the Data Factory towards its 

--- Document Chunk 2827 ---
strategic objectives. 

--- Document Chunk 2828 ---
The purpose of detailing the subsystem requirements is to provide a comprehensive understanding 

--- Document Chunk 2829 ---
of the individual and collective contributions of these components to the system's performance. By 

--- Document Chunk 2830 ---
delineating the specifications and requirements of each subsystem, we establish clear expectations 

--- Document Chunk 2831 ---
for functionality, interoperability, and per formance standards that are necessary for the seamless 

--- Document Chunk 2832 ---
integration and optimization of the Data Factory. 

--- Document Chunk 2833 ---
In this section, we will explore the intricate makeup of each subsystem, elucidating their purposes, 

--- Document Chunk 2834 ---
the specific needs they address, and the mechanisms by which they contribute to the data lifecycle 

--- Document Chunk 2835 ---
within the Data Factory. From data acquisition and management to processing and analytics, each 

--- Document Chunk 2836 ---
subsystem plays a pivotal role in ensuring data flows efficiently and securely, allowing for robust and 

--- Document Chunk 2837 ---
scalable solutions tailored to meet our stakeholders' diverse requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 2838 ---
Through this exploration, we will gain insight into how each subsystem's design and requirements 

--- Document Chunk 2839 ---
align with our strategic goals, ensuring that the Data Factory operates not just as a collection of 

--- Document Chunk 2840 ---
independent modules, but as a cohesive and harmonized unit, driving innovation and value creation. 

--- Document Chunk 2841 ---
A note on the interactions: When an interaction is described as bi -directional (both in the text and 

--- Document Chunk 2842 ---
the images), then the exchanged data are regarded on a high level such that some specific types of 

--- Document Chunk 2843 ---
data are transferred in one direction, others in the other.

Figure 29: Data Flow Diagram 

--- Document Chunk 2952 ---
2.7.1.1 Data Flow Explanation 

--- Document Chunk 2953 ---
• Initiation and Data Collection: 

--- Document Chunk 2954 ---
o Start Collecting New Data: The cycle kicks off with the collection of new data from the 

--- Document Chunk 2955 ---
train (vehicle), which is essential for the subsequent processes. 

--- Document Chunk 2956 ---
• Vehicle Data Management: 

--- Document Chunk 2957 ---
o Vehicle Data Logger: Acquire Data from Train:  The vehicle data logger's function is 

--- Document Chunk 2958 ---
to acquire data from the train ’s onboard systems . This data encompasses various 

--- Document Chunk 2959 ---
operational metrics and sensor outputs. 

--- Document Chunk 2960 ---

--- Document Chunk 2965 ---
FP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 81 of 213 17/12/2024 

--- Document Chunk 2966 ---
• Data Transfer and Simulation: 

--- Document Chunk 2967 ---
o Data Touchpoint: Transfer Data: At this point, the acquired data is offloaded from the 

--- Document Chunk 2968 ---
train (vehicle) and transferred into the Data Centre. The data touchpoint acts as a 

--- Document Chunk 2969 ---
gateway, facilitating the data's movement from the train to the system's internal 

--- Document Chunk 2970 ---
processes. 

--- Document Chunk 2971 ---
o Simulation Platform: Generate Data for Specific Scenarios: Another way to feed data 

--- Document Chunk 2972 ---
into the data factory is via the simulation platform. Using this platform it is possible to 

--- Document Chunk 2973 ---
generate synthetic data by executing non-regular situations. 

--- Document Chunk 2974 ---
o Interconnect Platform: Request Data: Using the Interconnect platform, it is possible 

--- Document Chunk 2975 ---
to bring additional data into the Data Factory, but this platform also enables the 

--- Document Chunk 2976 ---
exchange (import/export) of data by connecting other IT systems and data sources. 

--- Document Chunk 2977 ---
• Data Consolidation and Processing: 

--- Document Chunk 2978 ---
o Data Platform: Store, Process, and Provide Data: As a central hub, the data platform 

--- Document Chunk 2979 ---
receives input from the actual train data, the simulated data and the externally 

--- Document Chunk 2980 ---
connected data sources. The data is persisted here. The data is also prepared in such 

--- Document Chunk 2981 ---
a way that the required data quality and information is available for the ML models to 

--- Document Chunk 2982 ---
be trained. 

--- Document Chunk 2983 ---
• Machine Learning Integration: 

--- Document Chunk 2984 ---
o ML Platform: Provide Machine Learning Models: The ML platform comes into play by 

--- Document Chunk 2985 ---
using the prepared data to make it available for machine learning. Functions are also 

--- Document Chunk 2986 ---
provided within the platform to re-train and improve existing ML models. This phase 

--- Document Chunk 2987 ---
is crucial for determining the quality and performance of the ML model. 

--- Document Chunk 2988 ---
• Output: 

--- Document Chunk 2989 ---
o Trained ML Model: As a result of the ML platform, a specific algorithm or a trained ML 

--- Document Chunk 2990 ---
model leaves this platform, which has been trained and developed for a specific 

--- Document Chunk 2991 ---
application. 

--- Document Chunk 2992 ---
2.7.1.2 Data Flow Summary 

--- Document Chunk 2993 ---
• The entire process starts with data acquisition from the train, ensuring a fresh and relevant 

--- Document Chunk 2994 ---
dataset. 

--- Document Chunk 2995 ---
• The Vehicle Data management is conducted through a vehicle data logger that channels the 

--- Document Chunk 2996 ---
data to a touchpoint. 

--- Document Chunk 2997 ---
• The simulation platform enhances the dataset with synthetic data, while the interconnect 

--- Document Chunk 2998 ---
platform introduces external IT assets into the mix. 

--- Document Chunk 2999 ---
• The combined streams of real, synthetic, and external data will be flow at the data platform. 

--- Document Chunk 3000 ---
• The data is comprehensively prepared and processed on the data platform in order to make 

--- Document Chunk 3001 ---
it available for machine learning. 

--- Document Chunk 3002 ---
• The ML platform is where ML Models and algorithms are provided and trained and re-trained 

--- Document Chunk 3003 ---
and making use of the processed data. 

--- Document Chunk 3004 ---
• The output of the Data Platform is a trained machine learning model that can be tested and 

--- Document Chunk 3005 ---
applied to real-world scenarios.

2.7.1.3 Key Process Interactions 

--- Document Chunk 3013 ---
• Real and synthetic data integration supports robust model training. 

--- Document Chunk 3014 ---
• The integration of external IT assets ensures a more comprehensive range of data that can 

--- Document Chunk 3015 ---
be used for machine learning. 

--- Document Chunk 3016 ---
• The central processing node, the data platform, is crucial for data management and data 

--- Document Chunk 3017 ---
storage, as well as for data integrity and data quality. 

--- Document Chunk 3018 ---
2.7.2 Data Platform 

--- Document Chunk 3019 ---
Training machine learning models demands a substantial amount of data. To select the most suitable 

--- Document Chunk 3020 ---
data for a given application, efficient data management is indispensable. The Data Platform delivers 

--- Document Chunk 3021 ---
the essential functionalities for this purpose within th e Data Factory. These encompass ingesting, 

--- Document Chunk 3022 ---
processing, managing, curating, visualising, and annotating data as well as providing data to other 

--- Document Chunk 3023 ---
subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 3024 ---
 Upon the arrival of new data at the Data Factory, the data ingestion process verifies file integrity 

--- Document Chunk 3025 ---
and content, transforming the data into suitable formats for storage. Subsequently, data processing 

--- Document Chunk 3026 ---
pipelines are triggered to extract and generate metada ta. This metadata enriches the unstructured 

--- Document Chunk 3027 ---
sensor data, making it more manageable and searchable.  

--- Document Chunk 3028 ---
Users can explore stored data using a data catalogue and employ queries to find relevant samples 

--- Document Chunk 3029 ---
for their applications. These samples can then be organised into datasets for machine learning and 

--- Document Chunk 3030 ---
software validation. The Data Platform also governs data policies and rules that are enforced by the 

--- Document Chunk 3031 ---
data curation engine, such as access restrictions, data anonymisation, and data deletion.  

--- Document Chunk 3032 ---
Furthermore, it facilitates both manual and automated labelling of sensor data and provides 

--- Document Chunk 3033 ---
visualizations alongside annotations. Serving as the central repository for data, the Data Platform 

--- Document Chunk 3034 ---
ensures seamless access to its data for other subsystems.

on the transfer of data. This subsystem facilitates the offloading of data from trains, which 

--- Document Chunk 3373 ---
encompasses providing necessary network connectivity at predefined locations, ensuring that data 

--- Document Chunk 3374 ---
is consistently and efficiently transferred to the designated data centers. The Data Touchpoint serves 

--- Document Chunk 3375 ---
as a crucial interface, managing the flow of information and bridging the gap between the data's 

--- Document Chunk 3376 ---
origin on the trains and its subsequent storage and processing. Through its integrated sub -

--- Document Chunk 3377 ---
subsystems, such as the Automated Offload and DC Transmitter, the Data Touchpoint guarantees 

--- Document Chunk 3378 ---
that data not only reaches its destination securely but also that any data redundancy is managed 

--- Document Chunk 3379 ---
effectively. The Automated Offload is tasked with establishing robust network connections, while the 

--- Document Chunk 3380 ---
DC Transmitter handles the duplication of data to the Data Center and the meticulous removal of

--- Document Chunk 3480 ---
represents a key architectural component that enables the  Data Factory to interlink its internal 

--- Document Chunk 3481 ---
subsystems with external IT assets, thereby facilitating a streamlined and connected operational 

--- Document Chunk 3482 ---
environment. 

--- Document Chunk 3483 ---
At its core, the Integration Platform's capabilities are two -fold. Firstly, the Interactive Computation 

--- Document Chunk 3484 ---
Environment is designed to establish, manage, and decommission interactive computation 

--- Document Chunk 3485 ---
environments. This allows for dynamic scalability and adaptabilit y in processing needs. The 

--- Document Chunk 3486 ---
environment enables connections to be forged to these computation spaces, allowing users to 

--- Document Chunk 3487 ---
engage with the system interactively. It also ensures that data can be provided, processed, and 

--- Document Chunk 3488 ---
managed effectively, reflecting a commitm ent to fostering a collaborative and flexible interactive 

--- Document Chunk 3489 ---
compute ecosystem. 

--- Document Chunk 3490 ---

--- Document Chunk 3491 ---
enhancing efficiency and responsiveness within the Data Factory. The Integration Manager is a 

--- Document Chunk 3492 ---
pivotal element in this process, tasked with initiating, monitor ing, and updating processes that are 

--- Document Chunk 3493 ---
fundamental to the Data Factory's operations. It informs stakeholders with timely status updates, 

--- Document Chunk 3494 ---
ensuring transparency and informed decision -making. Furthermore, the Integration Manager 

--- Document Chunk 3495 ---
orchestrates the scheduling of tasks and jobs, enhancing workflow and productivity. Its capability to 

--- Document Chunk 3496 ---
provide containerization showcases the Integration Platform's advanced approach to deployment, 

--- Document Chunk 3497 ---
enabling portable and consistent software environments that are essential for modern DevOps  

--- Document Chunk 3498 ---
practices. 

--- Document Chunk 3499 ---
The Integration Platform acts as a central orchestrator, synchronizing the Data Factory's complex 

--- Document Chunk 3500 ---
matrix of subsystems and external interfaces. It supports interactive computational tasks, facilitates 

--- Document Chunk 3501 ---

2.7.8 Simulation Platform 

--- Document Chunk 4023 ---
Central to the Simulation Platform is the Asset Manager, which ensures that 3D assets are not only 

--- Document Chunk 4024 ---
created, updated, and deleted as necessary but also that their data and integrity are rigorously 

--- Document Chunk 4025 ---
validated, and permissions strictly controlled. This meticulous oversight enables accurate 

--- Document Chunk 4026 ---
representation and consistent quality in the simulation environment. 

--- Document Chunk 4027 ---
In parallel, the Scenario Sampler subsystem is engaged in the meticulous preparation, versioning, 

--- Document Chunk 4028 ---
archiving, and parameter setting for scenarios. This process is vital for the development of diverse 

--- Document Chunk 4029 ---
and realistic simulation scenarios, which are essential f or testing and refining Data Factory 

--- Document Chunk 4030 ---
operations. 

--- Document Chunk 4031 ---
Moreover, the Generator is the driving force behind synthetic data creation. It is responsible for 

--- Document Chunk 4032 ---
simulating scenarios and recording the resulting synthetic data streams. It also conducts checks and 

--- Document Chunk 4033 ---
stores this synthetic data, playing a crucial role in expanding the breadth and depth of data available 

--- Document Chunk 4034 ---
for simulations. 

--- Document Chunk 4035 ---
To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the simulations, the Validator is tasked with the validation 

--- Document Chunk 4036 ---
of both digital twins and 3D assets. This ensures that the simulated environments and objects closely 

--- Document Chunk 4037 ---

--- Document Chunk 4640 ---
supported GoA4 ATO functionalities. 

--- Document Chunk 4641 ---
Security and Access: The System Access and Security Platform, explored in Section  2.7.9, has 

--- Document Chunk 4642 ---
comprehensively addressed and implemented the required security measures. The holistic security 

--- Document Chunk 4643 ---
assessment based on established standards provides an essential guideline for IT and data security 

--- Document Chunk 4644 ---
within the Data Factory. 

--- Document Chunk 4645 ---
Lessons Learned and Future Recommendations: A key finding from the comprehensive analysis 

--- Document Chunk 4646 ---
is that the design and construction of such a complex system requires continuous, iterative 

--- Document Chunk 4647 ---
development. For future activities, it is recommended that the project focus on these iterative 

--- Document Chunk 4648 ---
processes, which are c rucial for managing the complexity of such a dynamic and multi -layered 

--- Document Chunk 4649 ---
system. 

--- Document Chunk 4650 ---
Concluding Remarks: Deliverable 7.1 not only summarizes current achievements, but also sets 

--- Document Chunk 4651 ---
the stage for future innovation within the R2DATO project and the wider Europe's Rail initiatives. It 

--- Document Chunk 4652 ---
symbolizes the collective commitment, technological capabilities and strategic insights that will lead 

--- Document Chunk 4653 ---
us into an era of improved efficiency and potential for  GoA4 automated train  operations. The 

--- Document Chunk 4654 ---
foundation laid with this report will pave the way for further progress and move the project towards 

--- Document Chunk 4655 ---
the ultimate goal of a digitized, connected and autonomous European rail network.

--- Document Chunk 5460 ---
Edge case of connected railcars. In this special case, two regional railcars are connected to 

--- Document Chunk 5461 ---
each other because of rush hour to have more space for passengers. They are still labelled as 

--- Document Chunk 5462 ---
one train with one polygon because the second railcar is inactive and is treated as an extension
