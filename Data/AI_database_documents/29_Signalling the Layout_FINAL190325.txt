--- Document Chunk 7 ---
Railways require signalling because many trains need to use the same tracks, drivers of trains cannot 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
“steer around” other trains or obstructions, and the braking distance of a train is greater than the 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
distance that the driver can see. The signalling must also deliver the train capacity required for the line. 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
Therefore, the signalling of the track layout is critical. 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
1. Purpose of Signalling and Functions 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
The key purposes of a signalling system are listed below.  These include certain functions which were in 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
the past managed largely or entirely by procedure, but are now generally regarded as essential 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
functions of the technical signalling system.   

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
 Set up a safe route for the passage of each train over the track that it is to traverse. 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
 Authorise the train to make the movement. 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
 Maintain the route while the train is making its movement. 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
 Supervise and/or enforce the train to stay within its movement authority. 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
 Release the route (for use by other trains) after the passage of the train”. 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
Functions have been further added which may include: 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
• The train driver (or ATO system) should be provided with appropriate information to control the 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
train.  

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
• Sufficient space should be provided between following trains to allow each train to brake to a 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
stand safely. 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
• Controls should be in place to prevent or mitigate the consequences of: 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
 Trains passing the end point of their movement authority.  

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
 Trains exceeding the maximum permitted speed.  

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
 Trains moving without authorisation. 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
• Protection should be provided for the public and trains at level (grade) crossings. 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
• The means should be provided for protecting trains, worksites, and workers during engineering 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
works. 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
• The signaller should be provided with appropriate information to enable the safe authorisation 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
of train movements. 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
• The system should have facilities to communicate between the signaller and others.  

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
• Means should be provided to prevent trains being signalled onto lines with which they are 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
incompatible. 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
• Facilities should be provided to instruct a train to stop in an emergency. 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
2. Movement Authority 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
• A Movement Authority (MA) is an authority communicated to the driver (or to the ATO system 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
driving the train) by the signalling system after it has checked that the section of line is clear 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
and secure. This grants permission for a train to enter a particular section of 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
line. Communication to the driver may be by means of lineside signals, or via an in-cab display 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
(or sometimes both). 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
• A MA will have some limits associated with it, which may be:   

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
 Speed at which the movement may proceed.  

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
(“Speed” signalling systems favoured in many parts of continental Europe)    

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
Signalling the Layout – IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 2 of 13 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
 Route and Distance to the end of the movement authority.  

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
(“Route” signalling systems – favoured in the UK and parts of the world historically 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
closely associated).   

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
• Traditionally a movement authority is communicated to a driver by means of a lineside signal 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
displaying a “proceed” aspect with the end of a movement authority indicated by a red lineside 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
signal aspect.    

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
• The nature of the “proceed” aspect provides information about the limitations associated with 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
the movement authority.  (“Speed” signalling or “Route” signalling). Except where the driver can 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
always see the end of movement authority from at least the braking distance (slow speeds and 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
good braking, start from rest) some form of restrictive (cautionary) aspect is necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
• Certain MAs permit a train to enter a section of line that is already occupied by another train to 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
allow trains to join, or to share platforms.  The communication of these MAs to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
includes the fact that the line ahead is occupied. Otherwise train separation is important, see 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
section 3.  

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
3. Train Separation 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
To avoid collisions, it is essential to maintain a safe distance between trains.  The most common 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
methods are described below. 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
3.1 On-sight train control   

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
On tramways and on certain railways there is little benefit in providing a comprehensive signalling 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
system. Rail traffic speeds, frequency, and braking performance may be such that safe operation can 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
rely on the driver being able to observe that the track ahead is clear. 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
3.2 Fixed block working 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
Railway lines are divided into “block sections” and in general only one train is permitted to occupy that 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
section of line at any one time. On low density lines a block section might be tens of kilometres, 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
whereas at the other extreme, on a very high-density metro line, a block section might be much less 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
than the length of a train. 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
One exception is that certain MAs permit a train to enter a section of line that is already occupied by 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
another train to allow trains to join, or to share platforms and sidings.  

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
Lineside signals usually define the start and end of a block section and provide authority to enter the 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
section. Towards the end of a movement authority, lineside signals specify where to stop and also give 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
adequate prior warning of this.  Where signals are not provided, the movement authority and the 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
remaining distance to its limit is given via some kind of in-cab display and/or an ATO (automatic train 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
operation) system, or by a verbal instruction. The following safe separation methods are based on fixed 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
block working. For new projects, Absolute Block Working has been largely superseded by Track Circuit 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
Block working, which is now evolving into ETCS.  

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
• Absolute Block working: The signallers at the entrance and exit of the block section must follow 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
a strict procedure to authorise a train to enter the block section and to confirm that the complete 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
train has left it (e.g. by observing the tail lamp on the back of the train). The length of block 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
sections is dependent on spacing between signal boxes, which is often dictated by the distances 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
between junctions, stations or level crossings. In most installations, electric block instruments are 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
used.  Typically, these are interlocked with signals and isolated train detection sections on 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
approach to the signals at the exit of the block section to enforce elements of the absolute block 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
working regulations.  

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
• Track circuit block working: Track circuit block signalling is a development of absolute block 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
signalling where the line is divided into reasonably uniform, and often much shorter, blocks 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
between adjacent stop signals, increasing the line capacity compared with absolute block 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
signalling. Only one train is permitted per block section, usually defined as between one stop signal 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
Signalling the Layout – IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 3 of 13 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
and the extent of the overlap (which is a safety margin) beyond the next. It requires continuous 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
train detection, which may be by track circuits or axle counters. 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
Where movement authority is given to drivers via lineside signals, the signals can only transmit a limited 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
number of different instructions to the driver. The meaning of each signal aspect must be clearly defined 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
in the driver’s rule book. The information presented differs significantly between different countries and 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
between route and speed signalling. There is often more than one caution signal before approaching a 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
stop aspect.  

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
3.3 European Train Control System (ETCS)  

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
This is the signalling component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). Unlike 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
CBTC systems, which are currently unique to each supplier, the ETCS is designed to be an 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
interoperable suite of products allowing trains to operate across borders without any country-specific 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
equipment and for one supplier’s on-board equipment to work with a different supplier’s fixed 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
signalling.    

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
ETCS specifies several different “levels” and variants, the most significant ones are:   

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
• Level 0 is used to refer to an ETCS fitted train using infrastructure not fitted with train protection or 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
when operation in higher levels is not possible.  

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
• Level NTC is used by an ETCS fitted train when operating over a line which is only equipped with 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
the National Train Control system (Class B).  Such systems in the UK are AWS/TPWS, in Germany 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
LZB and in Belgium Crocodile/TBL.  

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
• Level 1 provides in-cab signalling and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) in conjunction with fixed 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
block lineside signalling including train detection. Data is passed to trains from 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
switchable/controlled balises, inductive loops, or possibly radio.  

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
• Level 2 provides fixed block signalling and in-cab displays with conventional train detection. 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
Communication is mostly through radio communication (GSM-R [Global System for Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
Communications – Railway]), with balises used for fixed information (such as absolute position). 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
Lineside signals are only required if used as a solution for migration, or for allowing non-ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
trains to run on the same lines.   

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
• Level 3 is a term which formally became obsolete in baseline 3 (which subsumed it into Level 2) 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
but is frequently still used to distinguish the circumstances in which conventional train detection is 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
not required because reliance is placed on the on-board position reporting and train integrity 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
monitoring. There are no lineside signals and moving block signalling is possible, although not 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
necessarily implemented.  

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
3.4 Moving Block working 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
The signalling system calculates the safe space between a train and the one it is following. This 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
requires continuous communication between the central signalling system and the On-Board system 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
which supervises the train speed to maintain safety. The “blocks” are now a moving safe zone round 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
each train; the length of the safe zone ahead of the following train depends on its speed, along with all 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
the other factors that affect its braking distance. Therefore, a following train can be allowed to approach 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
very close to the rear of a stationary preceding train (e.g. when it has stopped in a station) because its 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
required braking distance decreases as its speed drops.   

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
Signalling the Layout – IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 4 of 13 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
Moving block allows trains to safely run closer together because the relative positions of two trains can 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
be determined with greater resolution than with track circuits or axle counters.  This can increase the 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
line's overall capacity. It is most beneficial for mass-transit railways where platform dwell times are a 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
large component of achievable headway. On mixed traffic lines it can still be valuable, but it provides 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
less benefit because the line capacity is more affected by the shared use of the line by trains of different 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
speeds, braking characteristics, conflicts at flat junctions (metro railways generally have grade 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
separated junctions, mainline railways have far fewer) and station stopping patterns.   

--- Document Chunk 153 ---

3.4.1 Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
CBTC covers a wide range of bespoke signalling solutions from a variety of suppliers, particularly used 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
on metro lines and generally has these characteristics:   

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
 Automatic Train Protection (ATP) & Automatic Train Operation (ATO)   

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
 Movement authorities are given to drivers via a display in the driving cab instead of lineside 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
signals.  

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
 The train-borne equipment communicates with fixed equipment on the lineside by radio. Other 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
communication methods have been used such as inductive loops in the track, these are 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
generally referred to as TBTC (Transmission Based Train Control)  

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
 Train position determined by the train itself (via a combination of fixed position references such 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
as balises, with subsequent estimation of the distance travelled primarily by wheel odometry but 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
supplemented by an independent method such as accelerometers) and then communicated to 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
the central signalling.  

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
 No requirement for lineside train detection (track circuits or axle counters) for normal operation, 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
but a certain amount is often provided for use in degraded modes, particularly when any train 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
becomes “non-communicative”.   

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
In addition to the capacity increase, a useful benefit of CBTC is the reduction in the quantity of lineside 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
equipment which offers maintenance and availability advantages (since otherwise it is often widespread 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
and in places that are difficult to access).  

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
Within the implementation of CBTC, signalling the layout is a relatively minor consideration compared 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
with other key considerations such as: the reliability and capacity of the communications medium, the 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
precision and certainty of a train’s footprint and recovery scenarios should a train cease communicating, 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
or a failure affecting a whole area. 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---

4. Braking 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
4.1 Significance of Braking 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
A feature of railways is the low friction between steel rails and steel wheels; this has energy-saving 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
advantages but means long distances to stop are required due to the limited adhesion. This can cause 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
slips (as the train accelerates) and slides (as the train decelerates) which is a factor that onboard 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
CBTC/ETCS needs to take into account (uncertainty is shown yellow in Fig 2).  

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
Trains can also be extremely heavy and/or travel at considerable speeds; a moving train therefore has 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
significant momentum and there is a lot of kinetic energy to convert to other forms of energy during the 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
process of stopping a train. 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
Hence, Braking Distance (BD) (i.e. the distance required for a train to brake to a stand from its highest 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
permissible speed at that position) is an important consideration within the design of a railway system to 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
realise the key requirement: “Sufficient space should be provided between following trains to allow each 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
train to brake to a stand safely”.   

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
Essentially this means that the signalling system has to communicate to the driver (or entity driving the 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
train) that they are approaching the end of their movement authority in sufficient time and distance to 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
enable the train to brake safely before it in all circumstances. 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
This can be achieved by:   

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
• Lineside signal aspects – (giving cautionary signal aspects- with speed or distance meaning).  

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
• In cab displays - (reflecting a braking curve- with speed or distance meaning). 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
• Communication with an ATO system.  

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
4.1.1 Factors affecting Braking Distance: 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
Braking distance depends upon:   

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
• Permitted speed of the train at the place that braking commences.  

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
• Braking rate of train (The braking performance of trains on a particular route is a key defined 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
interface between the rolling stock system and the signalling system). 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
• Likely adhesion conditions between the train wheel and the rail (affected by weather or oil 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
contamination that might cause slip/slide). 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
• The likely reaction time of the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
• Brake build-up delay, i.e. the time during which the brakes gradually become increasingly 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
effective after having been initiated by the driver (this depends on the design of the braking 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
system, the length of the train and is a particularly relevant factor for long freight trains). 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
• Effect of a rising or falling gradient on the effective braking rate. Clearly, a train travelling on a 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
rising gradient will be able to stop in a shorter distance and conversely will take a longer 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
distance on a falling gradient.  

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
• Train achieving specified performance throughout its life (wear & tear, some brakes potentially 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
isolated). 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
• The comfort of passengers. 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
The braking distance of a train in normal operation, taking into account all these factors is usually 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
referred to as a Service Braking Distance (SBD), whereas a train making an Emergency Brake 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
application would generally be able to stop in a significantly shorter distance. The SBD is utilised in 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
laying out signals but note that the spacing between block signals could be longer or shorter than SBD 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
(see Fig 4). 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
Figure 3: Scenario in which block sections are longer than Braking Distance 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
Equation of BD:  In principle (see 4.2), Braking Distance is proportional to the square of its initial speed 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
and dependent on the nominal braking rate of rolling stock (which in reality varies with speed and also 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
takes time to reach full effectiveness). 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
BD =   U 2 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
4.2 Specification of Braking Rates / Braking Distances 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
In reality braking distance assessment is much more complex than the simplistic example above.  

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
Different railways use a variety of approaches, generally based on empirical evidence. 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
Mixed traffic railways have to be catered for the often widely different braking characteristics of modern 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
passenger rolling stock and heavy freight trains. This is most commonly done by:      

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
• Calculating braking distances for higher speed passenger trains, laying out signals to suit these 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
distances, and then limiting freight trains to a speed at which they can stop within these 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
distances.    

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
• Calculating braking distances for freight trains, laying out signals to suit these distances, and 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
then accept that passenger trains will have excessive braking distance.     

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
Unless used in conjunction with lineside signals, ETCS/CBTC is not constrained to fixed positions, with 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
each train determining where to commence braking according to the specific circumstances and thus 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
these trade-offs do not need to be made.    

--- Document Chunk 252 ---

5. Aspect Sequences 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
Each railway administration has developed its own bespoke series of signal aspects with defined 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
meanings and the permissible sequence of aspects that can be displayed at successive signals. Their 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
meanings can be categorised as:    

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
• Stop – the end of the movement authority – almost universally Red or Twin Reds  

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
• Proceed, but prepare to stop at the next (or a subsequent) signal (route signalling practice).  

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
• Proceed, but limited to a defined speed (speed signalling practice).  

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
• Proceed at maximum permitted speed for that train.  

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
• Proceed only so far as you can visually see that the route is clear. (This is used for low-speed 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
movements, but nomenclature and usage vary significantly between different railway 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
administrations)   

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
Each railway administration also has defined permissible sequences of aspects that can be displayed 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
by successive signals. Figure 3 shows lineside signalling where there is one caution aspect before the 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
stop aspect, whereas Figure 4 shows closer signal spacing and that a second train can more closely 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
follow a first train on “clear” (unrestricted) aspects.  

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
Figure 4: Scenario in which block sections are shorter than Braking Distance 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
6. Overlaps 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
Drivers obey lineside signals and almost always stop at a red signal at the end of their movement 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
authority. However, there are occasions when drivers might fail to stop appropriately, for a number of 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
reasons including:    

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
• Misjudgement of braking performance (e.g. unexpected poor adhesion) 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
• Lack of attention or incapacity.  

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
• Lack of capability due to inadequate training.  

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
Many railway administrations reserve a portion of line beyond the end of a Movement Authority (beyond 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
the stop signal) as mitigation against driver mistakes or adhesion conditions.  This is called an Overlap 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
and, in general, is reserved for that one train in case it overruns. However, once the system has 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
determined that this train is stationary (and therefore no longer liable to overrun), this reservation is 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
released, permitting use of the area by another train.  

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
The length of an overlap can be determined in a number of ways:   

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
• A notional distance (sometimes dependent on the maximum speed on approach).  

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
• An individually calculated distance for every signal. 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---

7. Capacity 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
7.1 Simple Headway      

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
The Headway Time is the minimum time (which equates to a Headway Distance at constant speed) 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
between a train and a second following train, where the second train is approaching an unrestricted 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
proceed aspect (i.e. NOT a cautionary aspect).   In the simplest case, where the two trains are both 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
travelling at the same constant speed, then the Headway Distance between the front of the two 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
successive trains is as indicated:    

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
Figure 5: Constant speed headway (braking undertaken within one block section) 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
Headway Distance (H) 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
= S + P + O + L    

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
Where:    

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
L = Length of Train   

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
O = Length of Overlap  

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
P = Distance from the Stop aspect back to the first Unrestricted Aspect 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
on its approach  

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
S = Sighting Distance  

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
(allows for the fact that the driver might brake prior to reaching a 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
restrictive signal).  

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
For main line higher speed lines, P predominates and for lower speed & high-capacity metros, the other 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
factors tend to be more predominant.  

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
When calculating braking distance contribution to headway, it is important to work from the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
permissible speed NOT the timetabled speed.  For trains travelling at a constant speed, the headway 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
distance can readily be converted to a headway time, but this should use timetabled speeds. This 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
ensures that the worst case is taken into consideration.  

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
In Fig 5 which reflects any lineside signalling system in which there is only one cautionary aspect prior 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
to the red (e.g. UK mainline 3-aspect): 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
 P = twice the signal spacing, each of which is a minimum of SBD 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
  and therefore the best possible Headway = S + 2 x SBD + O + L  

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
In Fig 4 which reflects UK mainline 4-aspect signalling (but is essentially similar to some speed 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
signalling systems) where the braking from full line speed to a stop is achieved over two (or even more) 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
signal sections: 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
 P = three times the signal spacing, with alternate signals spaced at a minimum of SBD 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
 and therefore the best possible Headway = S + 1.5 x SBD + O + L  

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
Thus, the capacity of the railway has been increased, but at the cost and provision/maintenance of 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
significantly more signalling infrastructure.

7.2 Capacity constraints 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
In reality however, most railways have lengths of track for which the permitted speed is less than the 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
maximum elsewhere. Even where the speed profile of the line is unchanging, there are often 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
intermediate stations and consequentially those trains that stop will be slowing down and accelerating 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
again. If all trains stop and also have the same acceleration and braking characteristics, the signals can 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
be spaced appropriately for the resultant speed profile, taking advantage of the shorter braking distance 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
and attainable speeds.  This technique permits the distance between signals to be lower in the area of 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
the station and thus still deliver good headway time, despite the slower running and the platform “dwell 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
time”; it is usually only applied to metro railways. 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
However, if the signalling needs to facilitate the running of any non-stopping trains, the signal spacing 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
must always reflect the full braking distance; this means that the stopping headway (time between 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
successive trains which stop at the station) would be significantly increased. Timetabling one stopping 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
train between a pair of non-stopping trains utilises a disproportionate amount of line capacity.  Similarly, 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
if a line is used by trains of different speeds, it makes no sense to talk of the headway of the line; it is a 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
matter of working out the detail of how quickly the faster train will catch up the slower train and where 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
the track layout is such that it can pass (overtake) it.  Computer simulations of possible timetables being 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
implemented upon the proposed signalling are often undertaken at the conceptual stage of signalling 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
the layout. 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
Hence, factors that affect Headway are:  

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
• running stopping trains between non-stopping trains,  

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
• differential train speeds, meaning signalling cannot be optimum for both types,   

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
• junctions which may be high or low speed but are generally slower than the straight-ahead 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
speed. 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
Trade-offs need to be considered between capacity and speed. Service Braking Distance increases in 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
proportion to the square to the speed and so tends to dominate for a higher speed line; if it is 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
acceptable that the permissible speed is reduced then signals could be closer together and the capacity 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
improved. The optimum capacity in terms of trains per hour (minimum headways) is obtained where all 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
trains have the same characteristics in terms of acceleration, deceleration, maximum speed and 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
timetabled stopping patterns. The best way to improve capacity measured by “passengers per hour” is 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
often to run longer trains. 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
For metro type railways, factors other than the Service Braking Distance largely determine capacity, for 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
example the lengths of the train, the overlap, the sighting distance, the station dwell time. For heavy 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
haul mineral railways, the Service Braking distance is important, but junction clearance at the end of a 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
long single line section often predominates. 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
8. Operational use of Track Layout 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
So far, we have been considering a simple plain line railway, but we now need to look at the other 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
primary role of signals, protecting hazards such as points and level crossings. It is important to 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
understand the operational use which is made of the track layout i.e. what train movements are 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
required?  is there a need to join two separate trains together or undertake shunting movements 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
passenger and/or freight?  

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
Junction protection and Signalling arrangements will be considered in sections 12 & 13, to which the 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
considerations of section 9 are particularly relevant, but most of it applies to all signals so will be 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
considered next. 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
9. Signal Positions 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
Apart from the considerations of headway and braking distances, there are also other constraints on the 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
position of signals which need to be understood to correctly signal the layout.  Design for a particular 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
railway needs to follow standards of the relevant railway administrations because they vary. The 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
following paragraphs summarise the most common.      

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
Physical sighting: The purpose of the signal is to communicate information to the train driver. To 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
enable this, the driver needs to be able to see it clearly for a sufficient period of time to assimilate the 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
information. A site survey can be used to determine the final signal position to confirm readability, 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
although increasing use is being made of virtual signal sighting (a computer model based on existing 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
site data and reflecting the proposed alterations being undertaken).  Where a signal needs to be 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
positioned somewhere which does not provide adequate sighting distance, the sighting deficiency must 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
be mitigated (various railways has different mitigations; in UK Main line this generally involves provision 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
of a banner repeating signal).   

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
Parallel signals: Not only does a driver have to be able to see a signal, but they also have to 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
determine which signal applies to them if they can see more than one signal at the same time. For this 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
reason, many railway administrations require that, when there are parallel lines signalled for the same 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
direction of traffic, then the signals shall usually be adjacent to one another, unless specific measures 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
are put in place to mitigate the risk of incorrect reading.  Examples may be mounting one at much 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
reduced height or providing a short-range head or a physical screen to obstruct the view from other 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
directions. This is particularly applicable for platform departure signals.    

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
Maintenance & Installation constraints: Signals need to be installed in a practical position - often a 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
constraint on urban railways with viaducts and tunnels.  They also need maintenance, although this is 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
less of a consideration for a LED signal than a traditional filament lamp signal. The aim should still be to 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
avoid putting them where access would be a problem, such as on viaducts or in tunnels, but sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
this is inevitable because of the need to respect other constraints. Where other considerations permit, it 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
is advantageous to place the signal near an access point for convenience throughout its operational 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
life.  

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
Overlap clear of junction: If the overlap of a signal extends through a junction, then the route up to 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
that signal will lock the junction, until the train has come to a proven stand at the signal protecting the 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
junction. This clearly precludes other simultaneous conflicting movements through the junction.  It is 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
more flexible and greatly reduces the complexity of the interlocking if the overlap limit is before the 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
junction, especially on converging junctions (see Fig 13).    

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
Reasonably Even spacing: It helps a driver to know where to expect a signal if they are relatively 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
evenly spaced.  In particular, where an aspect sequence extends over two signal sections, it is easier 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
for the driver to judge their brake application if the intermediate signal is placed approximately mid-way 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
between the first caution and the stop. 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
Overbraking: The minimum distance between the first cautionary aspect and the stop signal at the end 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
of the movement authority is the service braking distance. However, if the actual distance is very 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
significantly greater than this, then there is a risk that the driver becomes accustomed to not applying 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
the brakes at the caution and may then forget or misjudge their brake application, resulting in the risk of 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
overrunning their movement authority. For this reason, excessive over braking should be avoided if 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
possible; In UK mainline, there is a 50% overbraking rule to limit this. Other railway operators prefer to 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
place distant signals at a consistent distance from every station, regardless of speed of line.   

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
Platform Starter signals: Where signals are required in the vicinity of a station platform, then they 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
should usually be positioned at or near the exit end of the platform (to minimise platform reoccupation 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
time). Alternatively, the signal should be at least a train’s length beyond the platform (so that no part of a 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
train stopping at it will still be in the platform).    

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
Standage: In certain parts of the layout, it is necessary to be able to fit a train of the specified maximum 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
length (perhaps in a loop line to allow the locomotive to run around to be at the other end of its train). 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
The position of signals relative to each other, or relative to the point work or level crossing on its 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
approach needs to be sufficient to avoid the rear of the train unnecessarily locking the infrastructure and 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
hence preventing other movements. This needs to be considered with an appropriate allowance for 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
Signalling the Layout – IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 11 of 13 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
such practical factors as the variation in stopping position of the train relative to a signal, and the 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
potential for possible “roll back” of the train (especially where trains without full brake fitment operate).    

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
10. Train Detection  

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
For the purpose of layout design, the important factor is defining the limits of each section. The number 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
of train detection sections provides the “resolution” of the signalling system’s view of train positioning. 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
 For the greatest “resolution” there needs to be more train detection sections, but clearly each section 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
provided comes with an economic cost. However, where there are ETCS trains reporting their positions, 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
this information can be used to create virtual sections (i.e. without needing equipment trackside) within 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
the interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
See section 12 regarding the positioning of train detection around point work. 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
11. Signalling plan – implications of Junction locking 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
In order to successfully signal a layout, it is necessary to understand the principles of operation of the 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
specific railway. In the diagram below, signals 1, 3 and 5 are all placed sufficiently far from the point 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
work that the overlaps beyond them are free of junction conflict; therefore all the points remain free until 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
a route is set from any of those signals. 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
Setting a route from signal 3 to signal 5 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
initiates the movement of 102 points and 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
101 points to normal and also reserves the 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
sections of track from signal 3 to the end 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
of the overlap beyond signal 5. As soon as 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
the route starts to set, the signaller is 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
prevented from setting a route from 1 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
signal to 5 signal, or from 4 signal to 6 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
signal; however a route from 4 signal to 2 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
signal may be set since this does not need 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
any of the already reserved section of line 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
and requires points 101 also to be normal. 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
Figure 12: Junction locking considerations 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
As soon as all points have been detected to be in the correct position (assuming all other conditions 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
are satisfied, such as relevant train detection sections proved clear), the signalling system will issue a 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
movement authority to the driver by clearing signal 3 to an appropriate aspect.  

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
After the train has passed signal 3 (or its Approach Locking otherwise released), the “Sectional Route 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
Locking” imposed on each track section is released behind the rear of the train as it progresses 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
through the route.  Once the train has moved wholly onto train detection section AD, 102 points 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
become free, with 101 remaining locked. This would prevent the route from signal 4 to 6 signal being 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
set until the train had cleared the whole of AD section even if actually physically clear of points 101; the 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
consequential delay would be lengthy if signal 5 were not showing a proceed aspect. 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
Unnecessary delay could be eliminated by 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
providing additional train detection 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
sections to release the locking on points 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
more quickly as shown in this diagram, 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
but these add to the cost.  

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
This is an example where Signalling the 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
Layout needs to balance various different 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
considerations when determining what 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
facilities are economically justified for the 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
intended use of the railway. 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
12. Signalling plan – implications of Junction Signalling arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
Where lines diverge, the track layout is often designed (for economic or geographic reasons) such that 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
one route (the main line) has a much higher permitted speed that the other route (the diverging line). 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
 When a train is routed onto the diverging line, the driver needs to know sufficiently early so that they 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
can adjust the train’s speed appropriately.     

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
• On a “Speed” signalled system, the driver can be notified by the aspect displayed at the 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
previous signal(s) the speed at which they may pass the junction signal.    

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
• On “Route” signalled systems, the driver is generally informed of the route set by means of an 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
Indicator at the junction signal and is expected to adjust their speed based on their knowledge 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
of the route.  The problem is that, unless some form of warning has been given to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
previously, there could be insufficient distance to brake to the permitted speed.   

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
On some railway administrations therefore, earlier speed reduction is partially enforced by “Approach 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
Release”.  This means holding the junction signal at red (or perhaps yellow) until the train is close to it 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
(and should therefore have slowed) and the driver will be able to see any signal indication of divergent 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
route before the signal clears for it. This methodology can on its own be unnecessarily restrictive and so 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
additional signal indications are sometimes provided at or near the previous signal(s).   

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
13. Level (Grade) Crossings 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
A level (grade) crossing is where a road crosses the railway line at the same level. Clearly there is a 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
need to ensure that the road is closed to road traffic before a train is able to pass across the level 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
crossing.  The signalling plan needs to take these factors into account.   

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
Railway administrations adopt a wide variety of methodologies for providing this protection with varying 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
arrangements of lights, barriers, operating sequences etc., dependent upon local practice and highway 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
regulations.    

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
However, they can be broadly split into 2 groups:   

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
• Crossings which are protected by signals. The signal is only allowed to clear when the crossing 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
has been proved to be closed to road traffic and the crossing area itself is clear. Signalling 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
design needs to ensure that protecting signals are positioned appropriately (not too close or too 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
far away from the crossing) and that the level crossing sequence is commenced sufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
early so that a train does not receive a restrictive aspect sequence from the signals on the 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
approach to the level crossing protecting signal.  

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
• Crossings which are not protected by signals continuously detect that no train is approaching in 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
order to maintain the road open. Signalling the layout must provide a means to give the 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
required minimum warning time before a train arrives at the crossing (e.g. positioning strike-in 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
points at sufficient distance), because it is essential that the road user is given enough time to 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
avoid being on the crossing. Generally, such crossings are not interlocked with signals but there 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
are special cases where there is a signal within strike in distance or if there is a station at which 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
trains may stop.  

--- Document Chunk 529 ---

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
14. Summary of activity 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
Signalling the layout is fundamentally the art of selecting the most appropriate positioning of signals for 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
the specific geography (the hazards to be protected, the design of the track layout, its speed and 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
gradient profiles, respecting other site constraints), which:  

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
• is capable of delivering the operational requirements (accommodating the mix of traffic types, 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
providing the appropriate routes to meet the specific needs of each of type, delivering the 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
overall capacity and specific headway demands, flexibility of use in the various modes of 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
operation),  

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
• takes into account the train characteristics (in particular the braking and acceleration 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
performance) and the railway’s specific signalling principles and operational procedures 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
designed to provide adequate safety, 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
• is as economic as possible, considering the whole life cost of the new system and its interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
to any existing signalling. 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
It is inevitably a compromise of conflicting requirements which need to be addressed, typically in the 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
following order: 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
1. Requirements which relate to the safe operation of trains, based on the statistically sound 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
assumption that drivers obey lineside signals; examples include sufficient braking distances, 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
permissible aspect sequences. 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
2. Requirements that relate to the relatively few occasions when drivers fail to obey lineside 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
signals; examples include excessive over braking, overlaps, train protection. 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
3. Requirements that relate to reliability, maintainability etc.
