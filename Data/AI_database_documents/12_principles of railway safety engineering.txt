Back to basics: Principles of  

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
railway safety engineering

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
This article continues the ‘back to basics’ 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
series, looking at the principles of safety 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
engineering as applicable to a railway, 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
particularly hazard and risk assessment, 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
identification and analysis techniques. 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
Previous ‘back to basic’ articles have 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
touched on the safety inherent in each of 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
the systems discussed; this article considers 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
how safety is achieved.

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
Definitions

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
Before we begin, it is necessary to be clear 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
on definitions and what is meant by the 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
different terms used.

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
• Safety: Freedom from unacceptable risk.

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
• Risk: The combination of the likelihood of 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
occurrence resulting in harm and the degree 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
of severity of that harm.

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
• Harm: Physical injury, material damage.

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
• Severity: A measure of the amount of harm.

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
• Accident: An unintended event or series of 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
events that results in harm.

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
• Hazard: A condition that could lead to an 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
accident; a potential source of harm; an 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
accident waiting to happen.

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
• Cause: Any event, state or other 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
factor which might contribute to the 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
occurrence of a hazard.

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
• Safety measure: An action reducing the 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
risk of a hazard.

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
The definition of ‘safety’ introduces the concept 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
that some risk is acceptable. This might seem 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
surprising at first reading, but there are plenty 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
of people who indulge in activities that others 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
consider too dangerous (e.g. bungee jumping or 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
flying). Others can see the benefits that it brings to 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
them (e.g. thrills or speed of travel).

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
This raises the question of who determines 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
whether a risk is acceptable or not. Sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
this is purely personal (whether to bungee jump or 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
fly), but when a service (such as rail travel) impacts 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
on the general public, it is usual for governments 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
to establish legislation with which those providing 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
the service must comply. The legislation is usually 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
aimed at reducing the amount of potential harm 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
to the general public and workers, whether that 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
harm is shock, injury, permanent damage (e.g. loss 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
of a limb or hearing loss) or fatality.

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
This is not a simple action for governments to 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
achieve as the public they are seeking to protect is 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
not consistent in their perceptions of acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
levels of risk. There is often a large outcry from 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
the public when a single train accident results in 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
several deaths, but the very many single deaths 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
that occur each day on the roads is felt tolerable. 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
This inconsistency is something that railway, and 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
other, engineers have learnt to live with.

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
From the definition of ‘risk’ we can see that if we 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
wish to avoid harm, we should seek to reduce risk. 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
This is achieved either by reducing the likelihood 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
of occurrence of harm, reducing the severity of 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
the harm, or both. Putting it another way, we can 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
reduce risk through two different approaches: 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
the first is to reduce the likelihood of an event 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
happening where the outcome may be harm; the 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
second is to reduce the amount of harm should 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
that event take place.

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
The definition for a hazard can also be expressed 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
as ‘an accident waiting to happen’. No accident 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
has taken place, but there is a dangerous situation 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
where if something else happens, it can lead to 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
an accident. Thus, for any given hazard, all that 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
is needed is a trigger event to start the process 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
which ultimately leads to the accident. An 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
example hazard is a level (or at grade) crossing 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
with no form of protection. The hazard (the 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
accident waiting to happen) occurs when a train is 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
approaching. There has not been any accident, but 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
one could happen if there was a car approaching 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
(the trigger event). An approaching car may now 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
collide with the train resulting in an accident with 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
consequences beyond the railway boundary.

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
“If we wish to 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
avoid harm, we 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
should seek to 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
reduce risk”

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
This sequence of events is illustrated in Figure 1 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
where: the level crossing is the wall; the hazard 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
is shown as the bucket of stones on top of the 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
wall; the trigger event is the hand knocking the 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
bucket over; and the accident is the stones falling 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
onto the flowers.

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
Risk reduction

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
From the diagram, we can see the accident can be 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
prevented, or limited, quite simply by: 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
• Removing the hazard: Design the railway 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
without a level crossing. 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
• Reducing the frequency with which the hazard 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
occurs: Reduce the number of trains that 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
use the crossing. 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
• Reducing the frequency of the trigger 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
event: Reduce the number of cars that use 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
the crossing, for instance by providing an 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
alternative and more attractive route for car 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
drivers to use). 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
• Reducing the likelihood of a collision: Design 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
a level crossing system that warns of an 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
approaching train; install barriers and road 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
traffic lights to stop road traffic; provide railway 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
staff to stop traffic; have the train sound its 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
horn on approach; ensure good sight lines.

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
• Reducing the severity of a collision: Reduce 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
the speed of approaching trains; provide 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
space for a car to divert into at the last minute; 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
design cars to survive the impact of a train. 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
This last point about car design is outside the 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
scope of railway projects but indicates how 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
solutions can lie outside of the expected areas 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
of interest as shown in Figure 2.

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
Trying to limit the number of falling stones in 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
our illustration in Figures 1 and 2 is not a perfect 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
solution. Any of the examples given above can fail. 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
If the means to limit the falling stones is shown as 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
barriers with holes, it is obvious that some stones 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
still make it through the holes in both layers and 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
crush the flowers underneath. But the impact, or 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
severity, of that accident is (hopefully!) smaller 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
than it might have been if no protection was put in 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
place – fewer flowers are crushed!

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
Risk reduction measures are sometimes expressed 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
in a hierarchy of control. This is shown in Figure 3.

control”

--- Document Chunk 152 ---

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
The explanation of the different levels is as follows:

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
• Elimination: design out the hazard (e.g. remove 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
the need for the road to cross the railway).

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
• Substitution: replace the hazard with 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
something less hazardous. For instance, we 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
could replace the level crossing with a bridge. 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
While in this example this might seem very 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
close to elimination, bridges bring their own 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
set of hazards due to bridge strikes, or vehicles 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
or objects falling onto the railway from the 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
bridge thereby blocking the line).

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
• Engineering: use work equipment or other 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
measures to help separate people from 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
the hazard. Examples are warnings, alarms, 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
guarding dangerous machinery from human 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
incursion (e.g. for level crossings, provide lights 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
and audible alarms as the train approaches).

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
• Administrative Controls: Identify and 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
implement procedures necessary to work 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
safely with the hazard. For example, we could 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
provide instructions and training both for 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
train driver and road users on how to use the 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
different types of level crossing.

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): This is 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
why motorcyclists wear crash helmets. Or 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
why people erecting scaffolding are tethered. 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
There is no example here for a level crossing. 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
But it is, for example, why many railway 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
administrations require their trackside staff 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
to wear high-visibility clothing. This makes 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
them more visible to the train driver, who 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
can sound the train’s horn, thereby giving the 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
trackside staff more time to get clear of the 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
approaching train.

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
The temptation, because it’s both inexpensive and 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
quick to implement, is to rely on the lower levels 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
of risk reduction, namely administrative controls 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
or PPE. People are unreliable at carrying out 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
instructions and obeying alarms, particularly under 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
stressful conditions. Therefore, the reliance on 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
these lower levels of control should only be used 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
where elimination, or substitution or the use of 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
engineering controls cannot be achieved.

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
Safety benefits and costs

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
It is expected that the engineering and operations 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
teams will implement good practice and adopt the 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
hierarchy of controls from the outset. Choosing 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
which control in the hierarchy to apply introduces 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
the concept of calculating the costs involved to 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
introduce a safety feature and then comparing 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
that with the safety benefit.

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
Calculating the costs is relatively straightforward 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
by asking questions such as: How much will it 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
cost to provide this extra design feature? How 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
much do any extra parts or items of equipment 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
cost to purchase? How much more will it cost to 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
operate and maintain the railway with this safety 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
feature implemented?

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
Determining the safety benefit over the lifetime 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
of the safety measure is a little harder and, at 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
times, controversial, not least because in addition 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
to fatalities, there are so many different types of 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
injury (both physical and mental). Does the age 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
of the individual matter? Or the number of their 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
dependants? Does the number of injuries or 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
fatalities in any one incident make a difference?

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
A number of countries have adopted a method of 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
converting injuries and fatalities into a common 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
measure. One method is shown below as a 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
Comparable Fatality Score (CFS) (note that other 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
countries and other railway administrations may 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
have different conversion rates):

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
• 10 major injuries to 1 fatality.

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
• 100 minor injuries to 1 fatality.

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
• 1000 negligible injuries to 1 fatality.

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
Each CFS is converted into a monetary value, 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
a figure that is set independently, usually at a 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
national level, typically with a figure around £1.5m 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
to £2m per comparable fatality. By comparing 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
the risk to life without the safety measure to the 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
risk with the safety measure, a reduction in the 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
CFS can be calculated. This benefit can then be 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
compared to the cost of implementing the safety 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
measure. This allows for a simple Cost-Benefit 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
Analysis (CBA). If the cost of implementation 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
is much higher than the reduction in CFS, 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
Substitution may see a 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
level crossing replaced 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
with a bridge, although 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
bridges bring their own 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
set of hazards.

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
then the project does not have to implement 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
the safety measure. In the UK, for example, a 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
project is obliged by law to reduce risk to As 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) and it is 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
this process of comparing project costs with a 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
reduction in CFS that enables the project team to 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
justify its decisions.

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
The demonstration of sufficient safety level is 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
a complex and challenging process. Different 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
countries will have different approaches to 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
demonstrate what is acceptable and what is 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
not. Adopting good practice through adherence 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
to standards or qualitative arguments may be 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
sufficient, with a CBA only used in the more 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
complex situations. However, CBA on its own is 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
not sufficient to demonstrate acceptable safety 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
levels. It cannot, for example, be used to claim 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
that adherence to statutory duties is not required, 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
or that intolerable risks are somehow acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
just because they offer a good CBA. Legislation 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
often weights the decision towards safety, 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
requiring risk reduction measures that may not 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
seem necessary when judged by a CBA alone. And 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
it should be noted that benefits may not be limited 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
to safety. There may, for example, be efficiency or 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
environmental benefits as well.

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
Defence in depth

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
How do we design systems that are ‘safe’? 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
We consider a process known as ‘Defence in 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
depth’. This consists of seven sequential steps as 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
discussed below.

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
Error avoidance: We work to prevent design errors 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
occurring in the first place by:

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
• Keeping the design simple. An overly 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
complicated system makes it harder to detect 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
errors in the design of the system. Safety and 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
non-safety elements of the design should be 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
kept separate. Avoid novel design features 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
and the use of subtle techniques that are not 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
clearly understood by others. Don’t provide 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
functionality that isn’t required in case it is 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
inadvertently activated. This is particularly 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
pertinent for software where complex 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
subroutines and self-modifying code can 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
result in faults in operation.

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
• Adherence to standards: People have spent a 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
lot of time documenting how things should 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
be done so that those who follow can benefit 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
from their experience. It also ensures that 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
people adopt a common approach to their 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
understanding of functional operation.

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
• Configuration Management: We need to 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
ensure that people are working from the 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
correct design information, and that the final 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
design drawings are marked correctly so 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
that the installation, test and commissioning 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
engineers can have confidence they are 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
installing, testing and commissioning the 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
correct design.

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
• Competence: Ensure those designing 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
the system know what they are doing! 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
Competence is defined as the combination 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
of knowledge and experience, which can 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
be grown through training, mentoring, 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
observation and assessment.

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
Error detection: If there is an error in the 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
design, we want to find it and remove it 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
before it is installed. This means designing 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
for testability and validation, checking and 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
reviewing designs, performing simulations, doing 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
software code walkthroughs and undertaking 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
development testing.

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
Fault avoidance: Even where the design is error-

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
free, faults can occur in operational service, and 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
so controls must be applied to minimise the risk. 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
These controls include:

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
• Design for reliable operation, by ensuring 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
components are not stressed when in 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
service (e.g. too much current through 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
electrical components, or too much load 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
for mechanical elements) and by choosing 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
reliable components.

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
• Perform proactive maintenance when in 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
service by maintaining at regular intervals or by 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
having systems that alert the maintainer when 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
in need of maintenance.

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
Personal Protective 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
Equipment is important, 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
but cannot guarantee 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
workers’ safety.

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
Fault detection: We are dealing with real-life 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
mechanical and electrical systems which will wear 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
and fail. So we want to ensure that faults can be 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
detected and rectified before any life-threatening 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
situation arises. We do this through:

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
• Specifying appropriate testing and 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
maintenance intervals and thresholds.

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
• Where there are several similar items, these 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
can be compared to determine where their 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
behaviour diverges.

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
• Provision of in-service self-diagnostic facilities.

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
• For software, the use of watchdog timers or 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
plausibility checks on data.

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
Fault tolerance: Knowing that faults will occur, we 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
can design our systems to tolerate certain levels of 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
faults. Examples include:

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
• Redundancy: Providing more than one 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
channel for the same information or control 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
flow. A common approach in computer-

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
based systems is to have three computers 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
undertake the same calculation and a voting 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
system checks that at least two of them agree. 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
This is known as a 2-out-of-3 voting system). 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
Note this protects against random hardware 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
failures (one channel may fail) but not against 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
systematic faults where there is a software 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
fault which causes all three channels to 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
produce the same wrong output.

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
• Diversity: This is similar to redundancy except 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
that the channels use different hardware 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
and/or software to avoid many systematic 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
errors. This can be through design diversity 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
(the 2-out-of-3 voting system uses different 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
microprocessors), functional diversity (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
automatic braking, but with a driver on board 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
to act in case the automated system fails), 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
manufacturing diversity (procure the same 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
product but from different suppliers).

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
Failure handling: We can ensure that we can 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
handle failures well through:

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
• Using known physical or electrical properties 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
to ensure that should a fault occur, it fails to a 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
known state (e.g. gravity returns a signal arm to

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
• Provision of alarms or other warning indicators.

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
• Instructions for people to follow in the event 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
that something does go wrong.

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
Hazard mitigation: Finally, given the system 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
may fail in an unsafe way despite all the above 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
best efforts, we consider implementing other 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
measures to reduce the overall risk such as crash 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
worthiness of vehicles.

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
Hazard identification and analysis

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
This is all good theory. But how are hazards 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
identified before they result in accidents? There 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
are three areas we need to consider:

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
1. The functions the system has to perf orm.

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
2. The users o f that system and how they are 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
expected to interact with it.

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
3. Interfaces with other systems.

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
In order to do this, the system you are analysing 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
needs to be comprehensively defined and 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
understood. Consider the introduction of a 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
station fire panel in an underground station as 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
shown in Figure 4.

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
The fire panel has one function: upon receipt 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
of an input from the actuator, it sends a control 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
signal via each of its interfaces to external systems, 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
so they can perform their functions.

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
In this example, there are three groups of people: 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
firstly the one who presses the actuator who 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
may need some instruction or guidance on when 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
to press the actuator and what to expect next; 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
secondly station staff who need training in the

event of an alarm; thirdly members of the public

who are expected to evacuate the station when 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
the alarm is activated. Designers and maintainers 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
are also important for any system but are not 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
considered in this particular scenario.

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
Five separate interfaces are identified, each of 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
which will have electrical, mechanical, physical 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
and functional properties. These are:

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
1. The actua tor input.

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
2. The fir e damper which closes the damper to 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
restrict the flow of oxygen to a fire.

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
3. The tick et gates, designed to open to permit 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
the quick and safe exit of passengers.

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
4. Automa ted public address system which 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
initiates announcements alerting passengers to 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
the need to evacuate the station.

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
5. Lifts which must move people to a 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
deemed safe floor.

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
It is quite usual to hold a Hazard Identification 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
(or HazID) workshop. It is important to get 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
representation from people who are experienced 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
in the system being considered, the environment 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
in which it will operate and how things might 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
go wrong. A HazID involves systematically 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
considering each function, each user operation 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
(or reaction in the case of members of the public) 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
and each interface. The conversation is seeded 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
with guidewords to encourage the meeting to 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
think about how the function, user or interface 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
might not work as intended. An example of 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
potential guidewords and their meanings are 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
shown in Table 1.

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
The workshop members can consider whether 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
each deviation from intended operation represents 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
a genuine hazard. Once all reasonably foreseeable 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
hazards are identified, the hazards can be analysed 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
to determine their likelihood and severity of 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
outcome. This aids understanding of the risk 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
and enables effort to be focussed on those 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
with the highest risk. This analysis is often done 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
qualitatively, and it is usual to see categorisations 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
of likelihood and severity similar to Tables 2 and 3.

Table 4 – Risk matrix. This allows a matrix of risk classification to be 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
developed where particular combinations of 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
likelihood and severity can yield a risk that is 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
intolerable, tolerable or negligible. An example is 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
shown in Table 4.

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
Note that all of the above tables are examples. 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
Different railway authorities may have different 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
categorisations and different acceptable levels 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
of risk. All such categorisations and levels must 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
be justified, and this is typically done in a safety 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
plan. In extreme cases, likelihood and severity 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
may need to be calculated quantitatively; this is 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
much harder to do.

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
Now the hazards are identified and their risk has 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
been considered, safety measures can be designed 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
to reduce those risks to a more acceptable level. 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
A project may need to bring together a number of 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
representatives to determine if a risk is acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
based on proposed measures.

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
Causes vs hazards

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
A common mistake in this process is to confuse 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
causes of hazards as hazards. This can result 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
in a long list of so-called hazards to manage, 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
increasing the time and cost involved to complete 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
the design. Avoiding this confusion is achieved 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
by being clear about the functions of the system 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
being developed, its users and its interfaces. This 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
usually entails developing a diagram showing all 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
the possible interfaces, making sure this includes 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
the human interactions as well as technical 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
interfaces. In the fire panel example, the function 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
of providing an alert to each of its interfaces could 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
have a hazard of ‘No alert to the interfaces’. This 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
could happen because the power supply to the 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
panel was faulty. The failing power supply is a 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
cause of the hazard.

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
Be alert!

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
Samuel C Florman was a Civil engineer who 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
started his career in the 1950s. In his book, “The 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
Civilised Engineer” he writes (p149):

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
“There will always be engineering failures. 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
But the worst kinds of failures, the most 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
inexcusable, are those that could readily be 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
prevented if only people stayed alert and took 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
reasonable precautions.

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
“…experience teaches us that society requires a 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
cadre of concerned citizens – engineers foremost 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
among them – to urge proper action and to 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
persist when rebuffed.

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
“Engineers, being human, are also susceptible 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
to the drowsiness that comes in the absence of 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
crisis. Perhaps one characteristic of a professional 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
is the ability and willingness to stay alert while 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
others doze. Engineering responsibility should not 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
require the stimulation that comes in the wake 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
of catastrophe.”

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
Staying alert requires the engineer to identify, 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
then assess the risks arising from the works being 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
undertaken. As engineers, we need to be alert 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
to how the design will be operated and how 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
the system will be maintained. We must foresee 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
changes in the operating environment that will 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
affect the system’s operation and consider how 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
that design will eventually be decommissioned. 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
Risks can arise through many areas. This includes 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
the physical aspects, human behaviours, the 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
processes which govern how tasks are performed,  

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
and the ability of people to perform a task when 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
under pressure. Having assessed the risks, the 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
engineer must design the system (consisting of 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
people and processes as well as the products 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
themselves) to mitigate against those risks.

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
“There will 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
always be 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
engineering 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
failures”
