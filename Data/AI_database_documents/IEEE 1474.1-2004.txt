Abstract:

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
 Performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train control

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
(CBTC) system are established in this standard. A CBTC system is a continuous, automatic train

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits;

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and train-borne and

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well as

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions. In

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
addition to CBTC functional requirements, this standard also defines headway criteria, system

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
safety criteria, and system availability criteria for a CBTC system. This standard is applicable to the

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
full range of transit applications including automated people movers.

IEEE Standards

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
 documents are developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
Committees of the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. The IEEE develops its standards

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
through a consensus development process, approved by the American National Standards Institute, which brings

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to achieve the final product. Volunteers are not

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
necessarily members of the Institute and serve without compensation. While the IEEE administers the process

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process, the IEEE does not independently

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information contained in its standards.

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
Use of an IEEE Standard is wholly voluntary. The IEEE disclaims liability for any personal injury, property or

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
other damage, of any nature whatsoever, whether special, indirect, consequential, or compensatory, directly or

The existence of an IEEE Standard does not imply that there are no other ways to produce, test, measure, pur-

chase, market, or provide other goods and services related to the scope of the IEEE Standard. Furthermore, the

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
viewpoint expressed at the time a standard is approved and issued is subject to change brought about through

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
developments in the state of the art and comments received from users of the standard. Every IEEE Standard is

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
subjected to review at least every five years for revision or reaffirmation. When a document is more than five

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
years old and has not been reaffirmed, it is reasonable to conclude that its contents, although still of some value,

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
do not wholly reflect the present state of the art. Users are cautioned to check to determine that they have the lat-

nterpretations: Occasionally questions may arise regarding the meaning of portions of standards as they relate to

specific applications. When the need for interpretations is brought to the attention of IEEE, the Institute will initiate

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
action to prepare appropriate responses. Since IEEE Standards represent a consensus of concerned interests, it is

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
important to ensure that any interpretation has also received the concurrence of a balance of interests. For this

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
reason, IEEE and the members of its societies and Standards Coordinating Committees are not able to provide an

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
instant response to interpretation requests except in those cases where the matter has previously received formal

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
consideration. At lectures, symposia, seminars, or educational courses, an individual presenting information on

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
IEEE standards shall make it clear that his or her views should be considered the personal views of that individual

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
rather than the formal position, explanation, or interpretation of the IEEE. 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
Comments for revision of IEEE Standards are welcome from any interested party, regardless of membership

Introduction

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
This introduction provides some background on the rationale used to develop this standard. This information

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
is meant to aid in the understanding, usage, and applicability of this standard.

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
Conventional signaling/train control systems rely almost exclusively on track circuits to detect the presence

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
of trains. Information on the status of the track ahead is provided to train operators either through wayside

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
signals or train-borne cab signals. Ensuring compliance with the signals is achieved through operating

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
procedures, wayside automatic train stops, or train-borne supervisory equipment linked to the train’s braking

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
system. These conventional systems are effective in providing train protection, but are not particularly

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
efficient in maximizing the utilization of the rail transit infrastructure, as a result of a number of fundamental

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
limitations, specifically, the following:

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
a) The location of trains can only be determined to the resolution of the track circuits; if any part of a

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
track circuit is occupied by a train, the whole track circuit must be assumed to be occupied by the

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
train. Track circuits can be made shorter, but each additional track circuit requires additional way-

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
side hardware, so there is an economical and practical limit to the number of track circuits that can

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
be provided.

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
b) The information that can be provided to a train is limited to a small number of wayside signal

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
aspects or a small number of speed codes in a cab signal system.

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
c) For a wayside signal system with automatic train stops but without continuous cab signaling,

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
enforcement is intermittent.

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
CBTC systems overcome these fundamental limitations of conventional track circuit-based systems, and

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
therefore, permit more effective utilization of the transit infrastructure. This is accomplished, for example,

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
by allowing trains to operate safely at much closer headways, by permitting greater flexibility and greater

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
precision in train control, and by providing continuous safe train separation assurance and overspeed protec-

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
tion. Additional benefits of CBTC technology include the economical support of automatic train operations

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
(both on the mainline and in maintenance yards), improved reliability, and reductions in maintenance costs

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
through a reduction in wayside equipment and real-time diagnostic information. The basic characteristics of

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
a CBTC system include the following:

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
1) Determination of train location, to a high degree of precision, independent of track circuits. 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
2) A geographically continuous train-to-wayside and wayside-to-train data communications network to

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
permit the transfer of significantly more control and status information than is possible with conven-

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
tional systems. 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
3) Wayside and train-borne vital processors to process the train status and control data and provide

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
continuous automatic train protection (ATP). Automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
supervision (ATS) functions can also be provided, as required by the particular application.

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
Although the benefits of CBTC technology are recognized, there are currently no independent standards

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
defining the performance and functional requirements that need to be satisfied by CBTC systems in order to

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
realize enhanced performance, availability, train operational flexibility, and train protection. This standard

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
has been developed to address this.

modified for use with this standard. Clause 4 defines the general operating requirements for CBTC systems,

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
including train operating modes to be supported. Clause 5 defines the performance requirements for CBTC

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
systems, including headway criteria, system safety criteria, and system availability criteria. Clause 6 defines

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
the functional requirements for CBTC systems, including automatic train protection (ATP) functions,

1.1 Scope

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
This standard establishes a set of performance and functional requirements necessary for enhancing

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
performance, availability, operations, and train protection using a CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
1.2 Purpose

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
There are currently no independent standards defining the performance and functional requirements to be

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
satisfied by CBTC systems. This standard will enhance performance, availability, operations, and train

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
protection and will facilitate new CBTC applications.

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
1.3 Existing applications

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
Existing CBTC installations and projects in progress prior to the publication of this standard need not

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
comply with the new or revised requirements of this standard, IEEE Std 1474.1-2004, except where

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
specifically required by the authority having jurisdiction.

4. General requirements

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
4.1 Characteristics of CBTC systems

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
The primary characteristics of a CBTC system include the following:

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
a) High-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
b) Continuous, high capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
c) Train-borne and wayside processors performing vital functions

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
4.2 Categorization of CBTC systems

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
This standard recognizes that different configurations of CBTC systems are possible, depending on the spe-

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
cific application. For example, a CBTC system may

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
a) Provide ATP functions only, with no ATO or ATS functions.

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
b) Provide ATP functions, as well as certain ATO and/or ATS functions, as required to satisfy the

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
operational needs of the specific application.

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
c) Be the only train control system in a given application or may be used in conjunction with other

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
auxiliary wayside systems.

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
A typical functional block diagram for a CBTC system is given in Annex B.

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
4.3 Range of applications

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
The CBTC performance and functional requirements defined in this standard are intended to be applicable to

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
the full range of transit applications, including light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail transit systems, and

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
shall be applicable to other transit applications, such as automated people movers (APMs) if CBTC is used

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
for ATC. 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
NOTE—ASCE 21-96 [B3] establishes additional requirements related to operating environment, safety requirements,

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
system dependability, and audio/visual communications for APM systems.

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
It is the intent of this standard that tiered levels of functionality, and interoperability between equipment

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
provided by multiple vendors, are facilitated to the extent required by the authority having jurisdiction. All

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
CBTC systems shall include ATP functions. 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
4.4 Train configurations

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a variety of train configurations, including the following:

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
a) Fixed-length unidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
b) Fixed-length bidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
c) Variable-length unidirectional trains 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
d) Variable-length bidirectional trains

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a mixed fleet of trains, where specific trains, and/or classes

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
of trains, have different performance characteristics.

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
4.5 Train operating modes

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
CBTC-equipped trains may be operated by either a single person or a multi-person crew. A CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
may also be required to support operation of trains without crews. 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
For operation of trains with crews, the train operator will typically be stationed in the lead car of the train

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
and will be responsible for moving the train from station to station. With a multi-person crew, the conduc-

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
tor(s) will normally operate from conductor position(s) within the train to operate the train’s doors. A CBTC

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
system shall support single-person train operation by combining the conductor and train operator display

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
information on the train operator’s display. For multi-person crews, conductor display information shall also

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
be provided on separate conductor displays.

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
For the purposes of this standard, operation of trains without crews includes both unattended and driverless

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
train operations. With unattended train operations, there would normally be no crew member onboard the

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
train. With driverless train operations, there may be a crew member onboard the train, but normally not in

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
the driving cab. This crew member, if present, would normally have no responsibility for operation of the

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
train except for failure recovery. 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
CBTC-equipped trains (including CBTC-equipped maintenance vehicles) shall be capable of operating in

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
various modes, depending on whether the train is operating in CBTC territory or non-CBTC territory, and

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
depending on the operational status of the train-borne and/or wayside CBTC equipment.

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
Mixed-mode operation shall also be considered a normal operating mode, to the extent specified by the

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
authority having jurisdiction. Mixed-mode operation is defined as the simultaneous operation within CBTC

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
territory of CBTC-equipped trains and trains that are not equipped with functional train-borne CBTC equip-

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
ment (including maintenance vehicles). Mixed-mode operation may be used in one or more of the following

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
ways:

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
a) A regularly scheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
b) An infrequent, unscheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
c) During the transition period only, as a new CBTC system is cut-in 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
d) As a result of train-borne CBTC equipment failures 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
4.5.1 Normal train operating modes in CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
4.5.1.1 CBTC-equipped trains

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory shall operate, within ATP limits, under the protection of

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
the CBTC system. The train shall be capable of being controlled manually by a train operator or

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
automatically by the CBTC system (supervised by the train operator, if present), as specified by the

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
authority having jurisdiction. When operating automatically, some functions (such as door operation and

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
train departure initiation) may continue to be the responsibility of the train operator and/or conductor(s), if

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
present.

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
4.5.1.2 Non-CBTC-equipped trains 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
Trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
equipment that are operating in CBTC territory shall operate under the protection of an auxiliary wayside

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
system and/or operating procedures, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
4.5.2 Failure mode train operations in CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
For light rail, heavy rail, and commuter rail applications operating with crews, it is an operational require-

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
ment to continue to move trains safely in the event of CBTC equipment and/or data communication failures,

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
possibly at reduced operating speeds and/or increased operating headways when compared to normal train

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
operations. As a consequence, a CBTC system shall be designed to support degraded modes of operation in

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
the event of failure and to continue to provide ATP with minimum reliance on adherence to operating proce-

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
dures. This shall be achieved through functional elements of the CBTC system itself, an auxiliary wayside

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction), or a combination of both systems. 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
For fully automated people mover applications operating without crews, the extent to which the CBTC sys-

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
tem shall be designed to support degraded modes of operation in the event of failure shall be as defined by

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
the authority having jurisdiction, and may include an ability to remotely reset train-borne equipment and the

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
ability to support automatic push/pull train recovery, as well as the ability to support manual train operations

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
and alternative routing strategies. 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
For all applications, a fall-back plan, based on failure analysis and operating procedures, shall identify train

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
operating modes that will take advantage of the degraded modes of operation and recovery capabilities of

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
the CBTC system. The goal of the plan shall be to eliminate hazards to passengers and staff in accordance

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
with 5.3, while continuing to provide passenger service. 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
Specifically, failure mode train operations in CBTC territory shall address those CBTC system failures

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
affecting the following:

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
a) All trains operating within a particular area of control 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
b) A particular train operating within any area of control

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
4.5.2.1 CBTC system failures affecting all trains operating within a particular area of control

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
In the event of a CBTC system failure that affects all CBTC-equipped trains operating within a particular

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
area of control within CBTC territory (e.g., wayside CBTC equipment or wayside-to-train data

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
communications failure), trains shall have the capability to provide continued safe operations under the

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
control of a train operator, and

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
a) With the protection of an auxiliary wayside system (if specified by the authority having

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
b) Through strict adherence to operating procedures; or

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
c) A combination of both items a) and b). 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within individual train-borne CBTC equip-

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
ment shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured. 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
4.5.2.2 CBTC system failures affecting a particular train operating within any area of control

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
In the event of a CBTC system failure affecting a particular CBTC-equipped train operating within any area

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
of control within CBTC territory (e.g., train-borne CBTC equipment failure), that train shall be capable of

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
continued safe operations under the control of a train operator, and 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
a) With the protection of an auxiliary wayside system (if specified by the authority having

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures; or

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c). 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within wayside CBTC equipment and within

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
other train-borne CBTC equipment shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.

4.5.3 Normal train operating modes in non-CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
For the purposes of this standard, non-CBTC territory is defined as any territory that is not equipped with

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
wayside CBTC equipment fully compatible with the train-borne CBTC equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
CBTC equipment installed on trains operating in non-CBTC territory shall include the necessary capabilities

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
to support transitions into CBTC territory. In addition, if specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train-

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
borne CBTC equipment may also perform other ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, such

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
as limiting train speed and/or providing zero speed detection. 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train-borne CBTC equipment operating in non-CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
territory may also interface with wayside equipment that is not fully compatible with the train-borne CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
equipment. In no case, however, shall the train-borne CBTC equipment provide an indication of standard

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
CBTC operation when operating in non-CBTC territory, unless the applicable authority or authorities

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
having jurisdiction over the train-borne and wayside equipment have ensured that standard CBTC operation

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
is supported by the integrated train-borne and wayside systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
4.5.4 Failure mode train operations in non-CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
Except where specified to perform certain ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, failure of

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---
the train-borne CBTC equipment shall have minimal impact on train operation. The failure shall be indi-

--- Document Chunk 1032 ---
cated to the train operator, if present. 

--- Document Chunk 1033 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1034 ---
4.6 Entering/exiting CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 1035 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1036 ---
4.6.1 Entering into CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
A CBTC system shall have precise knowledge of the limits of CBTC territory and shall include the capabil-

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
ity to perform verification checks of the train-borne CBTC equipment prior to entering CBTC territory. The

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
checks shall be performed sufficiently in advance of entry into CBTC territory to verify the proper operation

--- Document Chunk 1041 ---
of the train-borne CBTC equipment (including any wayside CBTC equipment dependencies). 

--- Document Chunk 1042 ---
If the verification check is passed, an indication to this effect shall be provided. Under normal circumstances

--- Document Chunk 1043 ---
and subject to ATP constraints, it shall not be necessary for a train to come to a stop when entering CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1044 ---
territory unless required for other operational reasons. 

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
In the event that the verification check fails, an indication of the CBTC system failure shall be provided, and

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
train operation may revert to the auxiliary wayside signal system if available or to operating rules if no aux-

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
iliary wayside signal system is provided.

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
The results of the verification checks shall be displayed on the ATS user interface. For trains operating with

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
crews, the results of the verification checks shall also be indicated to the train operator. 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
4.6.2 Exiting from CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
For trains operating with crews, prior to exiting CBTC territory, a CBTC system may provide a visual indi-

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
cation to the train operator of time and/or distance until the train will be exiting the CBTC territory. When

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
known by the CBTC system, the train operator may also receive an indication of the type of train control

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
system into which the train will be traversing. 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---
NOTE—Indications to the train operator may not be required if the transition between CBTC territory and non-CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
territory is operationally transparent to the train operator.

Under normal circumstances and subject to ATP constraints, it shall not be necessary for a train to come to a

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
4.7 Train operating speeds

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of meeting the performance and functional requirements of this standard,

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
over the full range of possible train operating speeds specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
5. Performance requirements

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
5.1 CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
The required design and operating headways (i.e., the minimum and scheduled headways) for both normal

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
and reverse directions shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. Headway may be specified as

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
uninterfered and/or interfered.

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
In all cases, the design headway shall be constrained by the safe train separation requirements and the safe

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
braking model of 6.1.2.1.

--- Document Chunk 1076 ---
In the case of an uninterfered headway, a train speed profile shall not be affected by a preceding train. All

--- Document Chunk 1077 ---
trains shall, therefore, perform at the maximum allowed speed, depending on the civil speed limits and the

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
acceleration and braking capabilities of the trains themselves. Operation at uninterfered headways facilitates

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
a minimum end-to-end trip time for a given set of station dwell times.

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
Headways may be reduced (at the expense of increased trip times) with an interfered headway where a train

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
speed profile is affected by a preceding train such that a following train decelerates on the approach to a

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
station and enters the station area at a reduced speed. Interfered headway may also be specified to support

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
multiple berthings at a station platform.

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
The design headway for a particular line and a particular set of vehicles involves many factors that are out-

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
side the control of the CBTC system (e.g., track alignment, gradients, civil speed limits, train acceleration

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
and braking rates, station dwell times, terminal track configurations, driver reaction times). These factors

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. This standard addresses only those CBTC factors con-

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
tributing to achievable headways, of which the most significant are the following:

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
a) Location (both accuracy of measured end-of-train locations and resolution of movement authority

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
limits for a given train), including the frequency at which location reports and movement authorities

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
are updated.

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
b) Speed, including both accuracy of speed measurement and resolution of speed limits established for

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
a given train at a given location.

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
c) Communications delays, including nominal and worst-case transmission times of command/status

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
messages between wayside and train, and vice versa. (Command/status messages include, for

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
example, messages related to movement authority updates and/or location report updates.)

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
d) CBTC equipment reaction times, including maximum error accumulation, for both wayside and

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
train-borne equipment, and for various operating modes, as applicable. (CBTC equipment reaction

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
times include, for example, the time required to establish new movement authority limits following

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
location report updates, the time to establish new movement authority limits through an

--- Document Chunk 1101 ---
interlocking, and the time to determine a new ATP profile following movement authority update.)

--- Document Chunk 1102 ---
e) CBTC system performance limitations (e.g., the maximum number of trains that can be processed

--- Document Chunk 1103 ---
by the CBTC system, within a given area of control).

--- Document Chunk 1104 ---
f) CBTC automatic speed regulation algorithm.

Typical values for the CBTC parameters in items a) through e) are given in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1109 ---
5.2 CBTC factors contributing to achievable trip times

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
Trip time requirements shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, consistent with train perfor-

--- Document Chunk 1111 ---
mance and track alignment characteristics.

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
The minimum end-to-end trip times for a defined set of station dwell times will result from uninterfered

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
headway speed profiles. The CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways, as identified in 5.1, will

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
also be factors contributing to the minimum achievable trip times.

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
5.3 System safety requirements

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
5.3.1 CBTC System Safety Program requirements

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
A System Safety Program shall be instituted during the CBTC system planning/design phase and shall

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
continue throughout the system life cycle. The CBTC System Safety Program shall emphasize the

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
prevention of accidents by identifying and resolving hazards in a systematic manner. A CBTC System

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
Safety Program Plan (SSPP) shall be developed for each CBTC application. The CBTC SSPP shall be

--- Document Chunk 1121 ---
prepared in accordance with the requirements of E.1 of Annex E or the requirements of the American Public

--- Document Chunk 1122 ---
Transit Association’s Manual [B1] or equivalent requirements, as approved by the authority having

--- Document Chunk 1123 ---
jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1124 ---
Implementation of the CBTC SSPP shall specifically recognize configuration management issues, given the

--- Document Chunk 1125 ---
importance of software and hardware configuration control in maintaining system safety.   

--- Document Chunk 1126 ---
5.3.2 CBTC hazard identification and risk assessment process

--- Document Chunk 1127 ---
Hazard analyses shall be employed during the design of a CBTC system to assist in the identification and

--- Document Chunk 1128 ---
evaluation of potential hazards to assess their likelihood and severity and to document their resolution. As a

--- Document Chunk 1129 ---
minimum, a preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) shall be conducted for each new CBTC system project.

--- Document Chunk 1130 ---
Other detailed analyses, including system/subsystem hazard analyses, failure modes, effects and criticality

--- Document Chunk 1131 ---
analyses, fault tree analyses, and operational and support hazard analyses, shall also be conducted if man-

--- Document Chunk 1132 ---
dated by the CBTC SSPP. These analyses shall be conducted in accordance with E.2, E.3, E.4, and E.5 of

--- Document Chunk 1133 ---
Annex E or equivalent requirements, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1134 ---
All hazards identified through the CBTC System Safety Program shall be assessed in terms of the severity or

--- Document Chunk 1135 ---
consequence of the hazard and the probability of occurrence. This shall be accomplished in general

--- Document Chunk 1136 ---
accordance with the criteria outlined in E.6 of Annex E or the equivalent, as approved by the authority

--- Document Chunk 1137 ---
having jurisdiction. Risk assessment estimates shall be used as the basis in the decision-making process to

--- Document Chunk 1138 ---
determine whether individual system or subsystem hazards shall be eliminated, mitigated, or accepted. This

--- Document Chunk 1139 ---
process shall include full documentation of the hazard resolution activities.

--- Document Chunk 1140 ---
Hazards shall be resolved through a design process that emphasizes the elimination of the hazard. The

--- Document Chunk 1141 ---
effectiveness of the hazard resolution strategies and countermeasures shall be monitored to determine that

--- Document Chunk 1142 ---
no new hazards are introduced. In addition, whenever substantive changes are made to the system, analyses

--- Document Chunk 1143 ---
shall be conducted to identify and resolve any new hazards.

--- Document Chunk 1144 ---
As a minimum, a CBTC system shall address the following critical/catastrophic system hazards through the

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
implementation of the ATP functions defined in 6.1:

limits of CBTC territory); hazard to be addressed through grade-crossing warning devices that may

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
include interfaces to the CBTC system (see 6.1.15)

5.3.3 CBTC vital functions

--- Document Chunk 1170 ---
To eliminate or control to a level acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction those hazards judged to be

--- Document Chunk 1171 ---
unacceptable or undesirable through the risk assessment process of 5.3.2, a CBTC system shall include, as a

--- Document Chunk 1172 ---
minimum, the vital functions identified in 6.1. 

--- Document Chunk 1173 ---
All vital functions of a CBTC system shall be designed and implemented in accordance with fail-safe

--- Document Chunk 1174 ---
principles. Documentation of the means used, and proof that fail-safe principles have been met and the mean

--- Document Chunk 1175 ---
time between hazardous event (MTBHE) requirements of 5.3.4 have been satisfied, shall be required for

--- Document Chunk 1176 ---
every CBTC system. 

--- Document Chunk 1177 ---
Verification that the processor-based portions of a CBTC system meet these minimum system safety

5.3.4 Quantitative CBTC safety performance requirements

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
For any CBTC system application, the CBTC wayside and train-borne equipment located within any

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
contiguous portion of a one-way route that can be traversed by a train traveling at the specified maximum

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
authorized speed for one hour or less shall have a total calculated aggregate MTBHE (total of all critical and

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
catastrophic hazards) of at least 10

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
9 operating hours. This includes the maximum number of other trains that

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
can be located in this contiguous portion of a one-way route under the specified peak operating headway.

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
System safety documentation shall support these calculations and substantiate the methodology used to

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
arrive at the result. For the purposes of MTBHE calculations, a hazardous event shall include, as a

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
minimum, the occurrence of any of the specific hazards identified in 5.3.2.

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
NOTE—If the end-to-end trip time for a given route is greater than 1 h, the MTBHE requirement for that route would be

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
adjusted proportionately. As an illustrative example, if the specified end-to-end trip time (per 5.2) for a given one-way

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
route is 2 h, and if the route includes 4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment, and if a maximum of 10 trains can be operating

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
on the route at a given time (when operating at the specified peak headway, per 5.1), then the MTBHE of the combined

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment and 10 sets of train-borne CBTC equipment on that route would be at least 0.5 × 10

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---
9

--- Document Chunk 1196 ---
operating hours.

5.3.5 Basic safety design principles 

--- Document Chunk 1202 ---
5.3.5.1 Normal transit system operations with no CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 1203 ---
A CBTC system shall respond safely and correctly perform all ATP functions within the normal range of

--- Document Chunk 1204 ---
inputs and other operating and environmental conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
All conditions necessary for the existence of any permissive state or action shall be verified to be present

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
before the permissive state or action is initiated by a CBTC system. The requisite conditions shall be verified

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
to be continuously present for the permissive state or action to be maintained.

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---
System safety shall not depend on the correctness of actions taken or procedures used by operating

--- Document Chunk 1209 ---
personnel. 

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
Procedures shall not be considered a substitute for safety functions that are to be vested in specific CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---
components or equipment.

--- Document Chunk 1212 ---
5.3.5.2 Abnormal transit system operations with no CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 1213 ---
A CBTC system shall respond safely under conditions of abnormal system loading, abnormal/improper

--- Document Chunk 1214 ---
inputs, and other abnormal external influences such as electrical, mechanical, and environmental factors.

--- Document Chunk 1215 ---
5.3.5.3 Response to CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 1216 ---
A CBTC system shall respond safely under conditions of credible hardware failure. 

--- Document Chunk 1217 ---
NOTE—The AREMA Communications & Signals Manual, Part 17.3.3 [B2], provides examples of credible hardware

--- Document Chunk 1218 ---
failures. 

--- Document Chunk 1219 ---
Failure to perform a logical operation or absence of a logical input, output, or decision shall not cause an

--- Document Chunk 1220 ---
unsafe condition, i.e., system safety shall not depend upon the occurrence of an action or logical decision.

--- Document Chunk 1221 ---
Hazard analyses shall consider all credible CBTC hardware failure modes. Justification shall be provided for

--- Document Chunk 1222 ---
conceivable failure modes that are not considered credible. The effect of each credible CBTC failure mode

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
shall be classified as either self-revealing or non-self-revealing, as follows:

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
— No credible single point CBTC hardware failure, whether self-revealing or non-self-revealing, shall

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
cause an unsafe condition.

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
— No credible CBTC hardware failure in combination with one or more non-self-revealing failure shall

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
cause an unsafe condition. In the instance of a non-self-revealing failure, a subsequent failure shall

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
not be considered independent.

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
— The probability of a critical or catastrophic hazard arising as a result of combinations of simulta-

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
neous independent self-revealing failures shall be considered in the calculated CBTC MTBHE.

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
5.3.5.4 Recovery from CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
A combination of functional elements of the CBTC system itself, an auxiliary wayside system (if specified

--- Document Chunk 1233 ---
by the authority having jurisdiction), and/or operating procedures shall provide for the safety of train move-

--- Document Chunk 1234 ---
ment under failure conditions, including failure recovery.

Std 1474.1-2004 IEEE STANDARD FOR COMMUNICATIONS-BASED TRAIN CONTROL (CBTC)

--- Document Chunk 1238 ---
5.4 System assurance requirements

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
5.4.1 General

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
The ability of a CBTC system to accomplish the functional requirements of this standard, under normal

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
conditions and under conditions of equipment failure, is of paramount importance to the authority having

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
jurisdiction. This subclause establishes qualitative availability, reliability, and maintainability criteria for

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
CBTC systems and equipment in order to meet or exceed the on-time performance and fleet availability

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
objectives of the authority having jurisdiction, and thereby minimize delays experienced by passengers. In

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
addressing CBTC equipment failures, a distinction shall be made between the following failure types:

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
a) Type 1: Those failures, or combination of failures, that impact on-time performance of the transit

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
system.

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
b) Type 2: Those failures, or combination of failures, that do not impact on-time performance of the

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
transit system, but do result in some other loss of specified CBTC functionality.

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
c) Type 3: Those failures that do not impact on-time performance of the transit system or result in a

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
loss of any specified CBTC functionality (e.g., because of equipment redundancy).

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
The CBTC system availability requirement (see 5.4.2) shall include consideration of all Type 1 failures, as

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
well as the mean time to restore service (MTTRS) for Type 1 failures.

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
The CBTC system mean time between functional failure (MTBFF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
consideration of all Type 1 and Type 2 failures.

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
The CBTC system mean time between failure (MTBF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include consideration of

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
all Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 failures.

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
While system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF predictions traditionally consider only hard-

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
ware failures, measurements of achieved system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF shall also

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
consider software errors (i.e., software fails to perform intended function) as well as hardware failures.

--- Document Chunk 1261 ---
The following general recommended practices apply:

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
1) Components and materials should be selected and appropriate standards of quality control and test

--- Document Chunk 1263 ---
procedures should be employed to ensure the lowest practical hardware failure rates for individual

--- Document Chunk 1264 ---
items of CBTC equipment (i.e., maximize the hardware portion of the system MTBF).

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
2) Unless non-redundant equipment is sufficiently reliable to satisfy the overall system availability

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---
requirements, appropriate levels of equipment redundancy should be employed such that the failure

--- Document Chunk 1267 ---
of a single component, processor, or device will not render the CBTC system unavailable or an oper-

--- Document Chunk 1268 ---
ationally critical function nonoperative (i.e., maximize the system MTBFF).

--- Document Chunk 1269 ---
3) A CBTC system should incorporate degraded modes of operation to minimize the operational

--- Document Chunk 1270 ---
impacts of equipment failures and to permit train movements to continue safely (i.e., maximize sys-

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
tem availability). 

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
4) CBTC system downtime or unavailability of an operationally critical function should be minimized

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
through the use of local and remote diagnostic capabilities and appropriate operating and mainte-

--- Document Chunk 1274 ---
nance procedures [i.e., minimize mean time to repair (MTTR)].

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
5.4.2 System availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
Quantitative CBTC system availability requirements shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
with appropriate consideration of the impacts of CBTC system and subsystem failures on the operation of

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
the transit system. Typical methods for defining CBTC system availability are provided in Annex F.

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability analysis/modeling shall be used to

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
predict the system availability for a given CBTC system configuration, based on equipment reliability/

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
maintainability calculations, equipment redundancy provisions, and other defined assumptions.

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability demonstration tests shall be performed

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
to determine actual CBTC system availability over a defined period, to a given confidence level.    

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
5.4.3 Equipment reliability requirements

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
Quantitative CBTC system and subsystem MTBF and MTBFF requirements shall be established by the

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
authority having jurisdiction, consistent with the CBTC system availability requirement of 5.4.2.

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
5.4.3.1 Design life

--- Document Chunk 1291 ---
CBTC equipment shall have a design life of 30 y.

--- Document Chunk 1292 ---
NOTE—The ability of a CBTC system to remain in operation to the end of its design life will be driven largely by long-

--- Document Chunk 1293 ---
term availability of spare parts. Specific requirements with respect to spare part availability shall be defined by the

--- Document Chunk 1294 ---
authority having jurisdiction and do not form part of this standard.

--- Document Chunk 1295 ---
5.4.4 Equipment maintainability requirements

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
A CBTC system shall be designed to minimize required maintenance (both preventive and corrective) by

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
maximizing the system MTBF and by including features that provide for ease of maintenance by mainte-

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
nance personnel. 

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
The mean time to repair/replace a failed piece of in-service CBTC equipment (i.e., first-level repair) shall

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
include on-site diagnostics, the replacement of failed components, and the testing of the repaired units, sub-

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
system, or system, but shall exclude travel time to the site. A separate MTTR requirement may be defined

--- Document Chunk 1302 ---
for second-level repair (i.e., shop repair of a failed line replaceable unit). 

--- Document Chunk 1303 ---
The first-level MTTR shall be no greater than 30 min. The second level MTTR, if specified, shall be no

--- Document Chunk 1304 ---
greater than 2 h.

--- Document Chunk 1305 ---
Achievable repair times will be driven by equipment diagnostic provisions and available test equipment, as

--- Document Chunk 1306 ---
well as the quality of the maintenance manuals and training. A CBTC system shall, therefore, include main-

--- Document Chunk 1307 ---
tenance and diagnostic capabilities to detect and react to CBTC equipment failures. This shall include

--- Document Chunk 1308 ---
remote diagnostics capabilities as well as local built-in test equipment and other fault displays for trouble-

--- Document Chunk 1309 ---
shooting, and the timely identification of failed components and functions.

--- Document Chunk 1310 ---
Data logging capabilities shall also be provided in wayside and train-borne CBTC equipment. The logged

--- Document Chunk 1311 ---
data shall be capable of being analyzed to be able to recreate the sequence of events leading to an incident.

--- Document Chunk 1312 ---
This will allow maintenance personnel to identify the cause of any failure and/or mis-operation of CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1313 ---
equipment that cannot be identified by the in-built diagnostics of the equipment. The scope of logged CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1314 ---
events shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1315 ---
A CBTC system design shall include capabilities to permit periodic verification of ATP hardware, software,

--- Document Chunk 1316 ---
and data, including verification of correct response to interference on the train-to-wayside data link. To the

--- Document Chunk 1317 ---
extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall also include capabilities to facili-

--- Document Chunk 1318 ---
tate modifications (by the user) to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and applications software. The

--- Document Chunk 1319 ---
supplier of the CBTC system shall identify to the authority having jurisdiction those specific changes to

--- Document Chunk 1320 ---
CBTC system parameters, track databases, and applications software that will have no impact on system

--- Document Chunk 1321 ---
safety.

--- Document Chunk 1329 ---
A CBTC system shall include the capability for providing ATP, ATO, and ATS functions. ATP functions

--- Document Chunk 1330 ---
shall provide fail-safe protection against collisions, excessive speed, and other hazardous conditions. ATP

--- Document Chunk 1331 ---
functions shall have precedence over both the ATO and ATS functions. ATO functions shall control basic

--- Document Chunk 1332 ---
operations that would otherwise be performed by a train operator and shall do so within the protection limits

--- Document Chunk 1333 ---
imposed by ATP. ATS functions shall provide system status information and the means to monitor and over-

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
ride the automatic control for various functions of the system. 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
The CBTC train-to-wayside communications interface shall be sufficient to support all required ATP, ATO,

--- Document Chunk 1336 ---
and ATS functions. The data link shall provide continuous geographic coverage within CBTC territory and

--- Document Chunk 1337 ---
shall support train operations in tunnels, tubes, and cuts, on elevated structures, and at grade. The data link

--- Document Chunk 1338 ---
shall support bidirectional data transfer and shall exhibit sufficiently low latency to support the defined per-

--- Document Chunk 1339 ---
formance requirements. The data link shall include a protocol structure to support safe, timely, and secure

--- Document Chunk 1340 ---
delivery of train control messages.

--- Document Chunk 1341 ---
6.1 ATP functions

--- Document Chunk 1342 ---
All ATP functions shall be vital functions and shall be designed and implemented in accordance with 5.3. 

--- Document Chunk 1343 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of providing bidirectional ATP.

--- Document Chunk 1344 ---
6.1.1 Train location/train speed determination

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
6.1.1.1 CBTC train location/train speed determination

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
CBTC train location/train speed determination shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
A CBTC system shall establish the location, speed, and travel direction of each CBTC-equipped train oper-

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
ating in CBTC territory. 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
CBTC train location determination shall safely and accurately establish the location of both the front and

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
rear of the train. The CBTC train location determination function shall provide sufficient train location

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
resolution and accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Train location

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
resolution and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
WARNING

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
Changes made to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and application software, other than those

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
identified by the supplier as not impacting safety, can affect safe system operation. Prior to implementing

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
any such changes, applicable hazard analyses of 5.3.2 shall be reassessed to verify that the modified

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
system will still meet all requirements of this standard including, but not limited to, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, and

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
5.3.5. Changes shall be implemented in accordance with the CBTC SSPP of 5.3.1.

--- Document Chunk 1363 ---
The CBTC train location determination function shall be self-initializing and shall automatically detect and

--- Document Chunk 1364 ---
establish the location of each CBTC-equipped train as it enters CBTC territory and on recovery from CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1365 ---
equipment failures, without requiring manual input of train location or train length data.

--- Document Chunk 1366 ---
The CBTC train speed determination function shall provide sufficient speed measurement resolution and

--- Document Chunk 1367 ---
accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Speed measurement resolu-

--- Document Chunk 1368 ---
tion and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1369 ---
A CBTC system shall compensate for the effects of measurement inaccuracies on train location and speed

--- Document Chunk 1370 ---
determination. Specifically, if the CBTC train location/speed determination function is dependent upon

--- Document Chunk 1371 ---
wheel rotation, the CBTC system shall correct for position errors induced by the slipping or sliding of

--- Document Chunk 1372 ---
wheels and shall correct for position errors caused by variation in wheel size due to wear, trueing, or

--- Document Chunk 1373 ---
replacement.

--- Document Chunk 1374 ---
6.1.1.2 Secondary train location determination

--- Document Chunk 1375 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, an auxiliary wayside system may provide secondary train

--- Document Chunk 1376 ---
location determination to establish if a section of track is occupied by one or more trains, including trains not

--- Document Chunk 1377 ---
equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment. It

--- Document Chunk 1378 ---
will not be necessary to determine the location of non-CBTC-equipped trains, or trains with inoperative

--- Document Chunk 1379 ---
train-borne CBTC equipment, to the same accuracy as CBTC-equipped trains.

--- Document Chunk 1380 ---
6.1.2 Safe train separation

--- Document Chunk 1381 ---
Safe train separation shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1382 ---
Safe train separation shall be provided between all trains operating in CBTC territory, whether or not the

--- Document Chunk 1383 ---
trains are CBTC equipped. 

--- Document Chunk 1384 ---
A CBTC system shall provide safe train separation between CBTC-equipped trains. Safe train separation

--- Document Chunk 1385 ---
shall be based upon the principle of an instantaneous (brick wall) stop of the preceding train.

--- Document Chunk 1386 ---
For mixed-mode operation (see 4.5), safe train separation shall be provided through an auxiliary wayside

--- Document Chunk 1387 ---
system and/or through strict adherence to operating procedures, as specified by the authority having

--- Document Chunk 1388 ---
jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1389 ---
If secondary train location determination is provided through an auxiliary wayside system (see 6.1.1.2), then

--- Document Chunk 1390 ---
for a CBTC-equipped train following a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative train-borne

--- Document Chunk 1391 ---
CBTC equipment, a CBTC system shall limit the movement authority of the following train to the boundary

--- Document Chunk 1392 ---
of the section of track occupied by the non-CBTC-equipped or failed train. If specified by the authority hav-

--- Document Chunk 1393 ---
ing jurisdiction, the CBTC system may further limit the movement authority to the route entry point of a

--- Document Chunk 1394 ---
route occupied by the non-CBTC-equipped train or failed train. 

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
The CBTC safe train separation function shall consist of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
a) The calculation of the ATP profile (i.e., the profile of safe speed as a function of train location),

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
derived from fixed ATP data (e.g., permanent speed limits) and variable ATP data (e.g., temporary

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
speed limits and movement authority limit)

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
b) The supervision and enforcement of the ATP profile calculated by the CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
The ATP profile shall be governed by a safe braking model (see 6.1.2.1) and shall ensure that under no cir-

--- Document Chunk 1401 ---
cumstances (including failures) will the movement authority limit be exceeded by a CBTC-equipped train. 

--- Document Chunk 1402 ---
The movement authority limit shall be the most restrictive of the following:

— The rear of a CBTC-equipped train ahead (as determined by the CBTC train location function in

--- Document Chunk 1407 ---

--- Document Chunk 1408 ---
— The boundary of a section of track occupied by a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inopera-

--- Document Chunk 1411 ---
— The end-of-track (see 6.1.5)

--- Document Chunk 1412 ---
— The entrance to an interlocking, when the route is not verified as aligned and locked (see 6.1.11)

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
— The boundary of a section of track with an opposing traffic direction established (see 6.1.12)

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
— The boundary of a blocked track (see 6.1.13)

--- Document Chunk 1415 ---
— If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the entrance to a highway grade crossing where

--- Document Chunk 1416 ---
warning devices are not confirmed to be operating (see 6.1.15)

--- Document Chunk 1417 ---
— The entrance to a route that is detected to be unsafe for train movement (see 6.1.16)

--- Document Chunk 1418 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC safe train separation function shall support auto-

--- Document Chunk 1419 ---
matic close-up of trains and automatic coupling and uncoupling of trains in designated areas.

--- Document Chunk 1420 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to bypass the CBTC safe train

--- Document Chunk 1421 ---
separation function to allow a train, under the control of a train operator, to travel beyond its movement

--- Document Chunk 1422 ---
authority limit (e.g., at a restricted speed), for failure recovery purposes. 

--- Document Chunk 1423 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to pull back (i.e., make more

--- Document Chunk 1424 ---
restrictive) a movement authority limit previously granted to a train. If the train were approaching or braking

--- Document Chunk 1425 ---
toward the original movement authority limit, the train may be in violation of the new ATP profile. Under

--- Document Chunk 1426 ---
such circumstances, a CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application. The brake application

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
may be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake application, as specified by

--- Document Chunk 1428 ---
the authority having jurisdiction (see 6.1.3).

--- Document Chunk 1429 ---
6.1.2.1 Safe braking model

--- Document Chunk 1430 ---
A safe braking model shall be developed for each CBTC application. 

--- Document Chunk 1431 ---
The safe braking model shall, as a minimum, include consideration of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1432 ---
a) Location uncertainty of lead train (including rollback tolerance)

--- Document Chunk 1433 ---
b) Location uncertainty of following train

--- Document Chunk 1434 ---
c) Train length

--- Document Chunk 1435 ---
d) Train configuration (see 4.4) 

--- Document Chunk 1436 ---
e) Allowable overspeed permitted by the CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1437 ---
f) Maximum CBTC speed measurement error

--- Document Chunk 1452 ---
applicable), minimum anticipated adhesion levels, and maximum design tailwind.

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
A typical safe braking model is provided in Annex D.

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
A CBTC system shall have the capability to support multiple safe braking models to accommodate different

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
train acceleration/braking rates for different classes and configurations of trains operating simultaneously

--- Document Chunk 1456 ---
within CBTC territory and to accommodate automatic close-up and automatic coupling/uncoupling

--- Document Chunk 1457 ---
capabilities, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A CBTC system shall incorporate appropriate

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
protection to ensure that the correct safe braking model is applied for a given train at a given location.

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
6.1.3 Overspeed protection and brake assurance

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
Overspeed protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
In establishing, supervising, and enforcing the ATP profile, as governed by the safe braking model of

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
6.1.2.1, a CBTC system shall ensure that under no circumstances, including failures, will the train’s actual

--- Document Chunk 1463 ---
speed exceed its safe speed. The safe speed shall be derived by considering the most restrictive of the

--- Document Chunk 1464 ---
following:

--- Document Chunk 1465 ---
a) The permanent speed limits on sections of track within the ATP profile

--- Document Chunk 1466 ---
b) Any temporary speed restrictions on sections of track within the ATP profile

--- Document Chunk 1467 ---
c) Any permanent speed restriction applicable to the particular class or configuration of train

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
d) Any speed restrictions enforced on the train because of train-borne failure conditions

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
e) The maximum speed that would allow the train to stop safely prior to the limit of the train’s

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
movement authority or to slow down sufficiently to meet appropriate permanent or temporary speed

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
restrictions upon entering that section of track

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
Speed limits and restrictions shall apply when any portion of the train is within the speed limit area.

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
Speed limit/speed restriction resolution parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
Enforcement of the calculated ATP profile shall be achieved by comparing the CBTC-determined train

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
speed with the ATP profile speed at the CBTC-determined train location. If the ATP profile speed at that

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
location is exceeded, the CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1477 ---
The brake application may be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake

--- Document Chunk 1478 ---
application, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. In the latter case, a CBTC system shall monitor

--- Document Chunk 1479 ---
the achieved brake rate to ensure an acceptable brake rate is achieved within a predetermined time frame; if

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
not, it shall immediately apply the emergency brakes. The safe braking model shall include appropriate

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
allowances for reaction times associated with this brake assurance function.

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
6.1.4 Rollback protection

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
Rollback protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
A CBTC system shall monitor actual train travel direction and shall compare measured travel direction with

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
the CBTC established/commanded direction of traffic. Train motion against traffic for more than a specified

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
rollback tolerance shall result in the CBTC system initiating an emergency brake application. Rollback

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
detection criteria for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
6.1.5 End-of-track protection

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
End-of-track protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration that permits

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
the operation of trains up to, or in close proximity to, an end-of-track terminus.

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
End-of-track protection shall be incorporated into, or function in conjunction with, overspeed protection to

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
prevent trains from over-traveling the end-of-track or, if buffers are specified, to prevent trains from exceed-

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
ing the design limits for impact with an end-of-track buffer. End-of-track protection design shall be based on

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1.

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
6.1.6 Parted consist protection and coupling and uncoupling of trains

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
Where separate vehicles can be coupled together in a consist of two or more vehicles or units to form a train,

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
a CBTC system shall have the capability of detecting and protecting parted trains. Parted consist protection

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
shall be required regardless of whether the individual vehicles or units are considered to be permanently

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
coupled or whether they are routinely uncoupled for maintenance or operational purposes.

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
A CBTC system shall also support operating requirements for coupling and uncoupling of trains, including

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
automatic update of the consist length within the CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may assume a fixed, worst-case, maximum

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
train length for a given class of trains operating in CBTC territory, with a reliance on operating procedures

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
to ensure this maximum train length is not exceeded.

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
6.1.7 Zero speed detection

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
Zero speed detection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration and shall be in

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
accordance with the requirements of 5.10 of IEEE Std 1475-1999. 

--- Document Chunk 1511 ---
Zero speed detection criteria for typical CBTC systems and applications are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1512 ---
6.1.8 Door opening control protection interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1513 ---
If trains are operated with crews, door open control protection interlocks may be a required ATP function, at

--- Document Chunk 1514 ---
the option of the authority having jurisdiction. For operation of trains without crews, door open control

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
protection interlocks shall be mandatory. These interlocks, if provided, shall ensure that the following

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
conditions are satisfied prior to enabling the opening of the train doors (and platform doors, if fitted):

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
a) The train is “properly aligned” at a designated stopping point, where the designated stopping point

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
and required tolerances shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
b) There is a platform (or other location specified by the authority having jurisdiction) on the side of

--- Document Chunk 1520 ---
the train for which the door opening is allowed. 

--- Document Chunk 1521 ---
c) Zero speed is detected, in accordance with 6.1.7.

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
d) The train is constrained against motion.

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
Selective door open enable shall be possible for those applications where the train length exceeds the plat-

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
form length.

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the

--- Document Chunk 1526 ---
preceding door open control protection interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

6.1.9 Departure interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1531 ---
If trains are operated with crews, departure interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the option of the

--- Document Chunk 1532 ---
authority having jurisdiction. For operation of trains without crews, departure interlocks shall be mandatory.

--- Document Chunk 1533 ---
These interlocks, if provided, shall prevent a stationary train from moving (e.g., by disabling the propulsion

--- Document Chunk 1534 ---
system) unless all train doors (and platform edge doors, if fitted) are properly closed and locked, in accor-

--- Document Chunk 1535 ---
dance with the requirements of 5.14 of IEEE Std 1475-1999.

--- Document Chunk 1536 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the

--- Document Chunk 1537 ---
preceding departure interlocks, for failure recovery purposes. 

--- Document Chunk 1538 ---
6.1.10 Emergency braking

--- Document Chunk 1539 ---
The train’s emergency brake system shall be capable of bringing the train to a stop within the assured stop-

--- Document Chunk 1540 ---
ping distance determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1. Specific criteria for resetting the emergency

--- Document Chunk 1541 ---
brakes to allow normal operation to resume shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. If condi-

--- Document Chunk 1542 ---
tions (as determined by ATP) are not correct for train movement, the emergency braking shall remain

--- Document Chunk 1543 ---
applied regardless of any reset signals or actions, except that facilities may be provided for a local manual

--- Document Chunk 1544 ---
bypass of the ATP functions for that train to permit manual train operation for failure recovery purposes.

--- Document Chunk 1545 ---
Use of such facilities shall require strict adherence to operating procedures to ensure the safety of train

--- Document Chunk 1546 ---
movements. If correct ATP conditions exist after the emergency brakes have been reset, the train shall be

--- Document Chunk 1547 ---
permitted to move or continue to move; however, if the actual train speed again exceeds the ATP profile

--- Document Chunk 1548 ---
speed or a subsequent malfunction occurs, emergency braking shall be applied as before.

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
6.1.11 Route interlocking

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
A CBTC system shall provide route interlocking functions equivalent to conventional interlocking practice

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
to prevent train collisions and derailments. These functions shall include locking of the route in advance of

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
the train entering the interlocking (time or approach locking) and once the train is in the interlocking (route

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---
locking). The switches shall also be locked when the track section containing the switch is occupied by a

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
train (detector locking). Locking functions shall also apply to moveable bridges and similar right-of-way

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
apparatus. Sectional release (of routes behind a train) may be provided where specified by the authority hav-

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---
ing jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1557 ---
NOTE—The AREMA Communications & Signals Manual, Sections 2 and 16 [B2], provides examples of recommended

--- Document Chunk 1558 ---
practices for use in interlocking design. 

--- Document Chunk 1559 ---
A movement authority shall not be advanced into an interlocking until the appropriate route is set and

--- Document Chunk 1560 ---
locked. Once a movement authority has been advanced through an interlocking, the affected route shall not

--- Document Chunk 1561 ---
be released and conflicting routes cleared unless either the train has traveled through and is verified clear of

--- Document Chunk 1562 ---
the interlocking or the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect.

--- Document Chunk 1563 ---
Where an auxiliary wayside system is specified by the authority having jurisdiction, interlocking functions

--- Document Chunk 1564 ---
may be provided by separate interlocking equipment, which is based on train position established by a

--- Document Chunk 1565 ---
secondary train detection subsystem. In this case, a CBTC system shall interface to and may modify the

--- Document Chunk 1566 ---
conventional interlocking functions based on train position established by the CBTC train location

--- Document Chunk 1567 ---
determination function, to safely enable the enhanced performance capabilities of a CBTC system to be

--- Document Chunk 1568 ---
realized. 

--- Document Chunk 1569 ---
6.1.11.1 CBTC interfaces to a separate interlocking

--- Document Chunk 1570 ---
Where an auxiliary wayside system or separate interlocking is specified, a CBTC system shall interface to

--- Document Chunk 1571 ---
interlockings as follows:

Std 1474.1-2004 IEEE STANDARD FOR COMMUNICATIONS-BASED TRAIN CONTROL (CBTC)

--- Document Chunk 1574 ---
22 Copyright © 2005 IEEE. All rights reserved.

--- Document Chunk 1575 ---
a) Time or approach locking shall apply, except in the event of a route being canceled for an

--- Document Chunk 1576 ---
approaching CBTC train (i.e., the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is

--- Document Chunk 1577 ---
in effect). In this case, if the train is greater than a safe braking distance from the entrance to the

--- Document Chunk 1578 ---
interlocking (as determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1) or the train stops prior to entering

--- Document Chunk 1579 ---
the interlocking, the route shall be released without running further time. 

--- Document Chunk 1580 ---
b) Traffic locking may be overridden so that CBTC-equipped trains may move in opposing directions

--- Document Chunk 1581 ---
within their respective movement authorities on the same track at the same time.

--- Document Chunk 1582 ---
c) Wayside signals and their aspects may be provided as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
A CBTC system may override the conventional aspects to cause the signal(s) to display CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1584 ---
aspect(s) only to CBTC-equipped trains.

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
6.1.11.2 Responses to CBTC train location failures

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function, route locking shall remain in

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
effect until the train is proven to be clear of the interlocking by the CBTC system (i.e., the train is subse-

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
quently determined to be clear of the interlocking limits), or through operating procedures, or a combination

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
of both approaches.

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function in an interlocking where train

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
location is also capable of being detected by means of a secondary system, CBTC system overrides of the

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
interlocking functions may be released, provided route and other locking functions are maintained by the

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
auxiliary wayside system so as to prevent the movement of a switch in front of and under the train until the

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
train is proven to be clear of the interlocking.

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
6.1.11.3 Response to loss of switch indication

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
In the event of a loss of switch indication once a movement authority has been issued through an interlock-

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
ing, a CBTC system shall pull back the movement authority to the entrance of the interlocking. If a train is

--- Document Chunk 1598 ---
already within a safe braking distance of the switch, the CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake

--- Document Chunk 1599 ---
application (see 6.1.2).

--- Document Chunk 1600 ---
6.1.12 Traffic direction reversal interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1601 ---
Traffic direction reversal interlocks shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system application

--- Document Chunk 1602 ---
requiring bidirectional operations, in order to support reversal of train direction at terminal stations and to

--- Document Chunk 1603 ---
support intermediate turn backs and shuttle modes of operation, for example.

--- Document Chunk 1604 ---
It shall not be possible to extend the movement authority for a train into a section of track where an opposing

--- Document Chunk 1605 ---
traffic direction has already been established.

--- Document Chunk 1606 ---
A reversal of traffic direction within a section of track shall not be possible unless

--- Document Chunk 1607 ---
a) All trains within that section of track are at zero speed and constrained against motion in the original

--- Document Chunk 1608 ---
traffic direction, and

--- Document Chunk 1609 ---
b) The movement authorities for all trains outside of that section of track do not extend into the section

--- Document Chunk 1610 ---
and are constrained from being extended into the section in the original traffic direction. 

--- Document Chunk 1611 ---
6.1.13 Work zone protection

--- Document Chunk 1612 ---
A CBTC system shall not grant movement authorities to trains to operate into out-of-service (blocked)

--- Document Chunk 1613 ---
tracks or through switches blocked in other than the required position and shall enforce restricted speeds on

--- Document Chunk 1614 ---
approach to and through defined work zones (see 6.3.7.4). A CBTC system may also include capabilities to

--- Document Chunk 1615 ---
preclude ATO mode of operation through a work zone.

6.1.14 Broken rail detection

--- Document Chunk 1620 ---
Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to an auxiliary wayside

--- Document Chunk 1621 ---
system for purposes of broken rail detection. A CBTC system’s reaction to a detected broken rail shall be as

--- Document Chunk 1622 ---
specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1623 ---
6.1.15 Highway grade-crossing warning

--- Document Chunk 1624 ---
Where highway crossings at grade exist within the limits of CBTC territory and where specified by the

--- Document Chunk 1625 ---
authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to grade-crossing warning devices to permit

--- Document Chunk 1626 ---
control of such devices based on CBTC location reports and to coordinate movement authorities through the

--- Document Chunk 1627 ---
crossing based on the status from such devices. Specific requirements shall be defined by the authority hav-

--- Document Chunk 1628 ---
ing jurisdiction and may include the following:

--- Document Chunk 1629 ---
a) Constant (and consistent) warning times, independent of train speed or acceleration/deceleration

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
b) For trains making station stops prior to crossings, delayed activation of the warning devices until the

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
train is ready to depart the station

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
c) When a train clears a crossing in multiple track areas, continued activation of the warning devices if

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
a second train would have reactivated the devices within a predefined time interval

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
d) Advance warning for priority control of traffic lights or other highway signage, in accordance with

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
IEEE Std 1570-2002 and/or the AREMA Communications & Signals Manual, Part 3.1.10 [B2].

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
6.1.16 Restricted route protections

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall include capabilities to prevent a

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
train from entering a route that is unsafe for movement of that type of train due to mechanical, civil, electri-

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
cal, or other predefined temporary or permanent conditions of the train or route, or through interfaces to

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
intrusion detection devices, platform edge doors (where fitted), and/or other devices capable of detecting

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
hazards that impact route integrity.

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
6.2 ATO functions

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
For operation of trains without crews, a CBTC system shall, as a minimum, be capable of providing all of

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
the ATO functions as defined in this subclause, to automatically operate trains in accordance with prescribed

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
operating criteria within the safety constraints imposed by ATP.

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
For operation of train with crews, the required ATO functions shall be as specified by the authority having

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
The CBTC wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data communications interface shall be sufficient to sup-

--- Document Chunk 1649 ---
port all required ATO functions.

--- Document Chunk 1650 ---
6.2.1 Automatic speed regulation

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
The starting, stopping, and speed regulation of the train as it travels along the track shall be automatically

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
controlled by a CBTC system so that the speed, acceleration, deceleration, and jerk rates are within specified

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
passenger comfort limits (as defined by the authority having jurisdiction) and the train speed is below the

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
overspeed limits imposed by ATP. 

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
Station stopping accuracy shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
A CBTC system shall support multiple ATO speeds, acceleration, and service brake rates in accordance with

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
the train operator (if present) or ATS inputs.

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
6.2.2 Platform berthing control

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of implementing any of the following platform berthing control modes:

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
a) Where the platform length is approximately equal to the train length, a CBTC system shall allow a

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
train to enter a station platform only if there is sufficient room to fully berth or if the preceding train

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
has a movement authority that shall allow it to fully leave the platform area and it has begun to move

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
out of the station (i.e., within ATP constraints, train movement shall be controlled to minimize the

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
likelihood of the train coming to a stop when only partially within the station platform limits).

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
b) Where the platform length is longer than the train length, a CBTC system shall support multiple

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
stopping positions within the platform area, as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---
c) Where the platform length supports multiple train berthings, a CBTC system shall allow a train to

--- Document Chunk 1671 ---
enter a platform while another train already occupies an alternative berth.

--- Document Chunk 1672 ---
d) Where the platform length is shorter than the train length, a CBTC system shall support platform

--- Document Chunk 1673 ---
berthings consistent with the door opening control protection interlocks of 6.1.8.

--- Document Chunk 1674 ---
6.2.3 Door control

--- Document Chunk 1675 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of automatically controlling train doors (and platform edge doors, where

--- Document Chunk 1676 ---
fitted) during passenger boarding and discharging. 

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
As defined by the authority having jurisdiction, automatic door control may be limited to the following: 

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
a) Automatic door opening only (with or without passenger door open requests) 

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
b) Automatic door closing only 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
c) Neither automatic door opening nor closing 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
If automatic platform edge doors are provided, they shall be controlled as a set with the matching train doors

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
such that the train and matching platform edge doors open and close together. It shall be possible to manu-

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---
ally disable the operation of any door set (both the train and the matching platform edge door) without

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
affecting the automatic operation of other door sets. The amount of time the train is to remain in the station

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
with doors open may be established by ATS (6.3.5.1) and automatically controlled by ATO.

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
6.3 ATS functions

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
6.3.1 General

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC may interface to, or be integrated with, an ATS

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
system. Under such circumstances, and to the extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, CBTC-

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
related ATS functions shall be implemented as defined in this subclause in order to benefit from the

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
characteristics of a CBTC system as defined in 4.1, namely, the availability of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
— Train location information to a high precision, independent of track circuits

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
— Continuous wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data communications link

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
— Train-borne and wayside data processing capabilities

--- Document Chunk 1695 ---
The CBTC-related ATS functions defined in this subclause shall be fully integrated with other conventional

--- Document Chunk 1696 ---
ATS functions and other non-ATS functions, as may be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, to

--- Document Chunk 1697 ---
support overall service management for the transit system and provide for a single consistent user interface.

--- Document Chunk 1698 ---
The CBTC data communications network, inclusive of the wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data com-

--- Document Chunk 1699 ---
munications interface, shall be sufficient to support those CBTC-related ATS functions specified by the

--- Document Chunk 1700 ---
authority having jurisdiction.

6.3.2 ATS user interface

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
Each ATS user interface shall display all information and implement all control actions, as defined in 6.3,

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
within acceptable latencies as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
Mandatory display data and user information inputs shall be in accordance with IEEE Std 1474.2-2003.

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
The ATS user shall be able to override any automated CBTC-related ATS functions defined in 6.3.

--- Document Chunk 1709 ---
Certain ATS functions (such as stopping a train en route and the application and removal of temporary speed

--- Document Chunk 1710 ---
restrictions, switch/track blocking, or work zones) can potentially introduce system hazards and the specific

--- Document Chunk 1711 ---
implementation of these functions shall be considered in the hazard analyses required by 5.3.2. ATS func-

--- Document Chunk 1712 ---
tions are not required to be implemented in a fail-safe manner; however, the hazard analyses shall take into

--- Document Chunk 1713 ---
account, as a minimum, the probability of 

--- Document Chunk 1714 ---
a) Safety-related commands not being executed when initiated by an ATS user,

--- Document Chunk 1715 ---
b) The CBTC system prematurely removing safety-related commands initiated by an ATS user,

--- Document Chunk 1716 ---
c) The CBTC system executing safety-related commands that were not initiated by an ATS user,

--- Document Chunk 1938 ---
Typical safe braking model

--- Document Chunk 1939 ---
D.1 Introduction

--- Document Chunk 1940 ---
A typical safe braking model for CBTC systems is illustrated in Figure D.1.   

--- Document Chunk 1941 ---
It should be noted that Figure D.1 is not drawn to scale, but is a simplistic representation to assist in the

--- Document Chunk 1942 ---
understanding of a typical CBTC safe braking model. It should also be noted that the safe braking model

--- Document Chunk 1943 ---
outlined here is defined for level tangent track and would need to be adjusted for grades.

--- Document Chunk 1944 ---
In Figure D.1, the emergency brake curve is the worst-case, open-loop, speed/distance curve a train will fol-

--- Document Chunk 1945 ---
low once the ATP has initiated an emergency brake application. This emergency brake curve must always

--- Document Chunk 1946 ---
be less than or equal to the safe speed curve, where safe speed is defined as the speed above which a critical

--- Document Chunk 1947 ---
hazard (derailment or collision) could occur.

--- Document Chunk 1948 ---
In this model, safety factors are accounted for in the emergency brake curve, train position uncertainties, and

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
other additional measurement tolerances incorporated in the CBTC system design, and there is no require-

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
ment to add additional safety margins.

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---
The ATP overspeed detection curve is the speed-distance curve that the ATP subsystem uses to immediately

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
initiate an emergency brake application, if the ATP subsystem detects that the measured speed exceeds this

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
curve at the measured train location. When the ATP subsystem has initiated an emergency brake application,

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
the ATP subsystem is no longer in the control loop, and the train will emergency brake at or below the

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
emergency brake curve. The emergency brake curve includes an initial propulsion runaway period, until

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
propulsion is disabled.

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
The ATP profile curve is the speed-distance curve that is an ATP overspeed allowance below the ATP over-

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
speed detection curve. The ATP profile is the base curve used by the ATP subsystem.

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
D.2 Train-borne CBTC response time (A)

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
In Figure D.1, it is assumed that the CBTC system will measure the train speed and train location (relative to

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
its movement authority limit) and compare the measure speed with the ATP profile speed at that measure

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
location, every A seconds (worst case).

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
In Figure D.1, point X represents the situation where the CBTC measured speed is just below the ATP over-

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
speed detection curve at the ATP measure location, i.e., although the ATP measured speed is above the ATP

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
profile, it is still within the ATP overspeed allowance. As such, the CBTC system will not initiate emer-

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
gency braking.

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
However, because of worst-case speed and location measurement errors (position uncertainty), it is possible

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
that the actual speed and actual location of the train could be a point Y.

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
At this point in time, although the train operator and/or ATO subsystem would normally be attempting to

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
bring the train speed down to the ATP profile speed, it is assumed that a failure occurs that results in the

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
train accelerating rather than braking.

PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS Std 1474.1-2004

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
Copyright © 2005 IEEE. All rights reserved. 33

--- Document Chunk 1975 ---
A seconds later, this situation will be detected by the CBTC system (point Z in Figure D.1), as the CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1976 ---
measured speed will now clearly be in excess of the ATP overspeed detection curve, and the CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1977 ---
will immediately initiate an open-loop emergency brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1978 ---
The speed at point Z therefore represents the maximum speed that a train can achieve above the ATP profile

--- Document Chunk 1979 ---
due to CBTC system’s worst-case response times and measurement errors.

--- Document Chunk 1980 ---
At this point, the remaining contributions to the safe braking model are determined by the vehicle character-

--- Document Chunk 1981 ---
istics only.

--- Document Chunk 1982 ---
D.3 Propulsion disable response time (B)

--- Document Chunk 1983 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled B in Figure D.1), the train continues to accelerate

--- Document Chunk 1984 ---
until the train propulsion system has been disabled in response to the CBTC system initiating an emergency

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
D.4 Coast time (C)

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled C in Figure D.1), the train is assumed to be coast-

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
ing at the maximum speed achieved as a result of the train accelerating prior to propulsion being disabled.

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
This component of the safe braking model ends when emergency braking begins to take effect.

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
D.5 Emergency brake build-up time (D)

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled D in Figure D.1), the emergency brake rate will

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
build up from zero to at least the GEBR. 

--- Document Chunk 1993 ---
D.6 Emergency braking at GEBR (E)

--- Document Chunk 1994 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled E in Figure D.1), the train continues to decelerate

--- Document Chunk 1995 ---
at the GEBR until the train comes to zero speed.

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
Note—The components D and E may be integrated into an equivalent single brake curve.

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
D.7 Position uncertainty

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
The safe braking model must include the maximum distance due to measurement inaccuracy by the CBTC

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---
system for both the leading and following train.

--- Document Chunk 2158 ---
factors engineering, human error analysis of operator functions, tasks, and requirements; effect of

--- Document Chunk 2159 ---
factors, such as equipment layout, lighting requirements, potential exposures to toxic materials;

--- Document Chunk 2160 ---
effects of noise or radiation on human performance). Those test-unique hazards that will be a direct

--- Document Chunk 2161 ---
result of the test and evaluation of the article or vehicle.

--- Document Chunk 2166 ---
and maintenance).

--- Document Chunk 2167 ---
f) Safety-related equipment, safeguards, and possible alternate approaches (e.g., interlocks; system

--- Document Chunk 2168 ---
redundancy; fail-safe design considerations using hardware or software controls; subsystem

Annex F

--- Document Chunk 2390 ---
(informative) 

--- Document Chunk 2391 ---
Typical approaches to specifying CBTC system availability

--- Document Chunk 2392 ---
F.1 Traditional equipment-based approach

--- Document Chunk 2393 ---
The traditional approach to defining system availability is the probability that the system is capable of oper-

--- Document Chunk 2394 ---
ating and performing its intended function at a random point in time, as determined by the system MTBFF

--- Document Chunk 2395 ---
and MTTRS, as shown in Equation (F.1): 

--- Document Chunk 2396 ---
CBTC system availability = system MTBFF / (system MTBFF + system MTTRS) (F.1)

--- Document Chunk 2397 ---
where 

--- Document Chunk 2398 ---
System MTTRS is the sum of the system MTTR and the mean travel times for maintenance personnel to

--- Document Chunk 2399 ---
travel to the site of a failure.

--- Document Chunk 2400 ---
With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:

--- Document Chunk 2401 ---
a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 2402 ---
b) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure

--- Document Chunk 2403 ---
c) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirement

--- Document Chunk 2404 ---
d) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system MTBFF

--- Document Chunk 2405 ---
For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined ana-

--- Document Chunk 2406 ---
lytically from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs.   

--- Document Chunk 2407 ---
Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service system

--- Document Chunk 2408 ---
MTBFF and MTTRS, with appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified

--- Document Chunk 2409 ---
boundaries of the CBTC system. 

--- Document Chunk 2410 ---
F.2 Alternative delayed trip-based approach 

--- Document Chunk 2411 ---
An alternative approach is to define CBTC system availability in terms of the system’s contributions to the

--- Document Chunk 2412 ---
desired on-time performance of the transit system, as shown in Equation (F.2):

--- Document Chunk 2413 ---
CBTC system availability = (F.2)

--- Document Chunk 2414 ---
where

--- Document Chunk 2415 ---
Revenue trip is a scheduled movement of a train, of defined length, from a point of origin to a destination,

--- Document Chunk 2416 ---
t

--- Document Chunk 2417 ---
x is a defined delay threshold,

--- Document Chunk 2418 ---
wx is a weighting factor associated with that delay threshold.

--- Document Chunk 2419 ---
With this approach, CBTC system availability would take into account the delays experienced by

--- Document Chunk 2420 ---
passengers. As the passenger judges transit system availability on the basis of the wait and travel time

--- Document Chunk 2421 ---
variations of the service provided, CBTC system failures that result in longer delays are penalized with a

--- Document Chunk 2422 ---

--- Document Chunk 2428 ---
greater weighting factor than failures that result in shorter delays. In general,  delay thresholds would be

--- Document Chunk 2429 ---
related to the operating headways, as delays at  shorter headways impact on-time performance more

--- Document Chunk 2430 ---
significantly.

--- Document Chunk 2431 ---
The CBTC system availability requirement may also cons ider other failure types, to the extent that such

--- Document Chunk 2432 ---
failures impact fleet ava ilability. For example, even  if a train-borne CBTC eq uipment failure does not

--- Document Chunk 2433 ---
immediately impact the on-time perf ormance of the transit system, it may subsequently result in missed

--- Document Chunk 2434 ---
revenue trips if the failure repair time results in the train being unavailable for service.

--- Document Chunk 2435 ---
With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:

--- Document Chunk 2436 ---
a) The quantitative CBTC system  availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 2437 ---
b) The various delay thresholds and weighting factors

--- Document Chunk 2438 ---
c) The average travel times to be assumed for maintena nce personnel to travel to the site of a failure

--- Document Chunk 2439 ---
d) The boundaries of the CBTC system cove red by the availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 2440 ---
e) The type of CBTC failures to be incl uded in defining the system availability

--- Document Chunk 2441 ---
For a given CBTC system configuration, the predic ted CBTC system availability could be determined

--- Document Chunk 2442 ---
through computer modeling from estimates of subs ystem MTBFFs and MTTRs, and an assumed system

--- Document Chunk 2443 ---
operating plan.   

--- Document Chunk 2444 ---
Actual CBTC system availability co uld be determined from measuremen ts of actual in-service delays, with

--- Document Chunk 2445 ---
appropriate adjustments for factors that are not in cluded within the specified boundaries of the CBTC

--- Document Chunk 2446 ---
system.
