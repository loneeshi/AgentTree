EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
Computers are ubiquitous and their number is increasing, and the railway sector is no different. A 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
huge amount of computing platforms is needed today, and even more will be needed in the future. 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
They are essential in on-board systems, trackside elements and in data centres for efficient, reliable, 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
and safe operation. By increasing the automation in the railway infrastructure including fully 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
automated trains, new requirements and expectations towards these platforms will arise and add 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
complexity, while the goal of safety must never be in jeopardy. 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
Supporting this growth in complexity and sheer number of computing systems and platforms, this 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
work package, supported by railway companies and industry partners, aims to define a specification 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
for modular platforms and deliver it to the ERJU System Pillar and future Innovation Pillar activities. 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
Based on the consolidated learnings of the work package’s first task and the intermediate deliverable 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
of the second task, this third deliverable provides the specification for the “Modular Platform s 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
Concept” (MPC). 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
The purpose of the MPC is to provide an up to SIL4 capable  computing platform that enables the 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
decoupling of hardware and software lifecycles and their respective update cycles. The MPC allows 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
extensions to  systems, updates , re-use of  previous developments  and consolidation of more 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
software on less hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
This deliverable achieves the specification of the MPC by presenting the concept itself and providing 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
a consolidated set of high-level platform requirements, collected from previous work, and updated to 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
align with ERJU work.  The MPC architecture is presented , introducing three different domains to 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
help with the complexity of the topic: The Application-Level Platform Independence (ALPI) domain – 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
with a strong focus on software and runtime environments, the Hardware -Level Platform 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
Independence (HLPI) domain – focusing on hardware abstraction and virtualisation aspects, and the 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
internal and  external interfaces – providing interoperability  to the outside and adaptability on the 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
inside of the MPC. For each of the domains, a thorough discussion  of its aspects  and resulting  

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
requirements are presented. 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
The detailed analysis of the topics also resulted in a n explicit list of open points that need further 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
technical investigation s and clarification – for example in demonstration projects – and, in some 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
cases, more detailed input from the ERJU System Pillar domain than currently available. 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
As of today, t he MPC specification cannot be implemented immediately in a way that would reach  

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
all its goals, due to the many important interchangeability details still being worked on in ERJU. 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
Nevertheless, together with the future results of work package  36 (the on -board platform 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
demonstrator), the ERJU Innovation Pillar FP2 “R2DATO” will be able to  showcase its vision o f 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
railway modular compute platforms on a solid foundation. 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
This deliverable concludes task  2 of work package  26. Modular certification approaches will be 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
discussed in task 3.

1 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
This document, inside the framework of the R2DATO project, provides the detailed specification on 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
Modular Platforms developed in the Task 26.2. 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
The objective of the activities in WP26 are to obtain: i) a Modular Platform independent from the 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
applied functions, and ii) a platform that can be introduced into the railway environment on -board 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
and wayside. 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
One of the objectives of this work is to consolidate the Modular Platform definition describing its 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
architecture and the interactions between the different modules that compose it. 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
The activities that produced the document are the continuation of  this work package’s  existing 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
deliverables, previous projects such as  RCA/OCORA, Shift2Rail and others . See chapter 2.3 for 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
details on input documents used. 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
The partners involved in this project have leveraged their extensive skills and expertise acquired 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
over the years, including their contributions to previous projects and the development of proprietary 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
platforms. As a result, they have collaborated to create a comprehensive summary, the details of 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
which are outlined in this document. 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
The goal followed is to define the basis for providing a Modular Platform that allows to implement 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
Functional Systems in a platform independent manner  (HLPI), and also Functional Applications 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
(ALPI) so that Business Logic is agnostic as much as possible about complexity of HW, Safety, 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
Security and that can be used for Safe and Non -Safe functions and is applicable for wayside and 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
on-board systems.  Furthermore, the Modular Platform enables aggregating systems of different 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
vendors on same COTS hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
Within R2DATO , the Modular Platform Concept discussed in deliverable D26.3 are relevant for 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
migrating existing products as well as new functionalities, due to their need of regular updates and 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
more advanced computational needs. These fields of applicability will need investigation in a future 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
phase of R2DATO, though. This work package focuses in the current phase on the use of standard 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
COTS components. 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
The work in this deliverable unifies on-board and wayside use cases as much as possible. However, 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
there are environmental constraints  like available volume and climate conditions , leading to 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
differences in size and available computing resources in a typical system.  In the end n o major 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
impacts on the basic concept have been identified in this deliverable, even though on-board and 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
wayside realisations may choose partly different solutions depending on their specific needs and 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
their technical and normative constraints. 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
The deliverable describes the approach for a suitable Modular Platform by describing the goals and 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
concept in detail, presenting an updated set of high-level requirements for such a platform, deriving 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
an architectural basis, and detailing out three main components of the concept: application -level 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
platform independence, hardware-level platform independence, and necessary interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---

2 DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
In this chapter, the methodology on how this deliverable has been developed is discussed. The 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
methodology section consists of four sections: i) Deliverable Objectives; ii) Process Overview; iii) 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
Existing and Relevant Documents; iv) Methodology for Deliverable Development. 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
2.1 DELIVERABLE OBJECTIVES 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
This deliverable is created on the basis of the guidelines as described in the Grant Agreement (GA). 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
From GA the Task 26.2 of WP26 has this mandate: 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
In this activity, based on Task 26.1, the detailed work on any specifications needed in the context 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
of modular platforms is performed. This would likely (subject to the agreements in Task 26.1) 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
include: 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
• The further collection and consolidation of requirements from railway applications to IT 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
platforms. 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
• The further development of the architecture of IT platforms for the future railway system. 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
• The further specification of the API between (safety -critical and non -safety-critical) railway 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
applications and IT platforms. 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
• Specification of common diagnostics, orchestration, and remote update interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
• Specification of common safety -related application constraints (SRACs), to the extent that 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
these would be needed. 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
The input available for the creation of this deliverable was as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
1. Relevant input from partner projects, mainly from System Pillar  domains deliverables, was 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
collected, analysed and if relevant, included in the deliverable. No further input was considered 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
after May 2024. 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
2. The Deliverable D26.2, which contains what was achieved in the initial phases of task 26.2 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
and which this document is based upon. 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
3. Feedback from the “Onboard Platform Demonstator”, R2DATO work package 36. 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
2.2 PROCESS OVERVIEW 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
The Figure 1 shows the process followed in task 26.2 to develop deliverable D26.3. 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
As can be seen from the process shown in the  Figure 1, the main steps that participated in the 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
achievement of the final document are indicated.

2.3 EXISTING AND RELEVANT DOCUMENTS 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
As input to the Work Package 26 process, the state of the art was considered and deliverables from 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
past projects were identified and actively requested at the Work Package level. For this process, 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
inputs were collected from several relevant projects: 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
• Computing Platform – Whitepaper from OCORA [5] 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
• Computing Platform – Requirements from OCORA [6]

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
specification of the Modular Platform” [19] 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
• X2RAIL-3 Deliverable 8.2 [21] 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
To avoid further delay and ensure a viable result before the deadline M23 of WP26, the work package 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
team started work on the basis of these deliverable and draft documents, establishing the potential 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
gap with the intended WP26 results. 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
2.4 METHODOLOGY FOR DELIVERABLE DEVELOPMENT 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
The deliverable D26.3 as the successor of D26.2 can be considered as the final consolidation of 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
specifications for the wave one of R2DATO . This work group relie s on previous deliverables e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
from X2RAIL and OCORA. In parallel, inputs were also sourced through diverse SP Task 2 domains. 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
These became the fundamental inputs to start the process of input collection. 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
At the beginning of the activities a DDP (Deliverable Development Plan) was developed and agreed 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
by all the partners, it was followed for the D26.3 writing activities. 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
The work carried out in Task 26.2 involved the study of the results obtained in previous projects. 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
Without prejudice to the valid work carried out in the previous projects, a series of points have been 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
highlighted by the WP26 partners which are reported below: 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
• Identify suitable solutions; 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
• Try to reuse experience coming from specific partners; 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
• Integrate the parts coming from previous projects that were considered stable; 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
• Find a compromise between complexity and feasibility; 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
• Try to provide solutions that do not favour a specific partner/provider; 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
• Be able to have an application-independent solution; 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
• reuse of available standard COTS products on the market, taking full advantage of the 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
evolution of ICT and OT technologies. 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
Once these activity development points have been identified, the first step was to define the 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
operational aspects in which the Modular Platform shall operate. 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
After the chapters were drafted, the workgroup followed a structured approach from the point of 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
drafting the chapters to finalizing of the deliverable with the required consensus and approval. In line 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
with the DDP the following steps illustrate this process: 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
1. First development stage – responsibility of partner writing the chapters; 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
2. Review – responsibility of partner reviewing the chapters; 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
3. Second development stage – responsibility of partner writing the chapters; 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
4. Formal review – responsibility of partner reviewing the document; 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
5. Third development stage – responsibility of partner writing the document;

3 MODULAR PLATFORMS CONCEPT (MPC) 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
The concept for modular platforms as present ed in this deliverable enables interchangeability and 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
maintainability for railway computing applications and the platforms they are  deployed on. The 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
concept is agnostic to trackside and on-board use, targets COTS hardware and integrates workloads 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
with different criticality – basic integrity up to SIL4. 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
The results created by R2DATO work package 26  are based on several inputs. Previous work has 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
already been captured in the first deliverable  [18], and an intermediate version of the concept has 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
been introduced in the second deliverable [19]. The basic architectural concepts, however, are taken 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
directly from the ERJU System Pillar Computing Environment Domain  deliverables ([14], [15], see 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
the discussion in chapter  3.7) and are not developed in work package 26.  Work package 26, 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
however, decided to treat all defined interfaces with similar priority for this deliverable, extending our 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
scope. Nevertheless, there has been and still is a constant expert exchange between work package 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
26 and the Computing Environment Domain. 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
The subchapters present the Modular Platform Concept’s  (MPC) purpose, scope, stakeholders, 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
goals & non -goals, assumptions, and known issues and limitations. The alignment with the ERJU 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
System Pillar activities is discussed in detail, including the glossary (see chapter 3.7.2) that has been 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
developed in alignment with the SP CE domain . Details on the handling of PRAMSS in MPC are  

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
stated. Based on ERJU System Pillar input, user stories, and operational context and scenarios are 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
given. The intended usage for the MPC and exemplary platform environments are discussed last. 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
The following three chapters will discuss in detail the important puzzle pieces of the Modular Platform 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
Concept, namely hardware -level platform independence  (HLPI) in chapter  6, application-level 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
platform independence (ALPI) in chapter 7 and platform management interfaces in chapter 8. 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
Additional terms introduced for the MPC can be found in the glossary in Appendix F. 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
3.1 PURPOSE 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
The Modular Platform Concept is an extension of the ERJU System Pillar Computing Environment 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
architecture proposal. The purpose of the Modular Platform Concept (MCP) – and of work package 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
26 – is to explore the feasibilit y of the following items and educate other R2DATO work packages 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
and the System Pillar about MPC to foster its adaptation and integration. 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
MPC-P01 The decoupling of hardware and software lifecycles , leading to the decoupling of their 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
respective update cycles. 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
MPC-P02 The decoupling of software with different lifecycles, such as security related components, 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
services like diagnostics, base software, and applications. 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
MPC-P03 Providing a generic and basic framework for future Basic Integrity up to SIL4 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
applications. 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
MPC-P04 Enabling the extension of functionality to an already deployed modular platform , for 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
example adding ATO to an existing CCS after initial deployment. 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
MPC-P05 Enabling re-use. For example, a diagnostics stack , e.g. as defined in EULYNX  [2], can 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
be used in different projects . Also, the need to deploy and maintain multiple variants of 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
the same function can be reduced. 

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
MPC-P06 Consolidating more software on less hardware.

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
MPC-P07 Shaping a picture of the feasibility, scenarios, and benefits around potential multi-vendor 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
approaches (spanning hardware , consolidated systems,  and software) , including 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
functional safety applications.1 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
3.2 SCOPE 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
The MPC is a generic approach to computing, embedded in a railway landscape. As such, it can 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
potentially cover wayside and rolling stock systems. 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
As these environments might have specific requirements towards computing systems, the following 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
scope limitations are necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
MPC-S01 Wayside and on-board are to be treated equally where possible. Where differences are 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
encountered, the more encompassing variant guides the definition  of the MPC, with 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
potential simplifications stated. 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
MPC-S02 The MPC as defined in here is not intended to achieve full compatibility to all or even 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
specific existing applications. 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
3.3 STAKEHOLDERS 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
Within ERJU, there are several stakeholders for the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
• The ERJU System Pillar Computing Environment domain delivering the basis and analysing 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
the work package 26 results 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
• Other ERJU System Pillar domains with interfaces towards or interest in the MPC 

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
• The work package 26 members 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
• ERJU R2DATO, in particular the on-board platform demonstrator (R2DATO work package 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
36) as a potential specification consumer, validator, and feedback instance 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
• R2DATO Wave-2 work packages for the potential continuation (e.g. continuation in R2DATO, 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
e.g., future in demonstrators) and other prototying projects 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
3.4 GOALS & NON-GOALS 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
For this deliverable on the MPC specification, the work package defined several goals and also 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
explicit non-goals. 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
MPC-G01 Goal: Create a basic and initial technical reference respectively feasibility study for 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
railway-grade modular platforms. Target audience: IMs, RUs, Industry. Focus questions: 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
Where are the pain points?  

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
What are needs and benefits from standardization in a technical context?  

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
What would need to be agreed on from a technical perspective to enable the concept? 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
MPC-G02 Goal: Create a basic set of requirements (for the layers  respectively interfaces and 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
between them) and suggestions how to evaluate them (potentially in R2DATO Wave-2) 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
1 This is not going to be covered in this deliverable, but is rather the topic for the subsequent task  3 of work package 26. 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
The contents of this deliverable will be an input to the activity, however.

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
against the stated MPC purposes with regards to: complexity, performance limitations, 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
technical innovation needed, ... 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
MPC-G03 Goal: Shape and influence R2DATO Phase 2 with our output (future work and potential 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
demonstration). 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
MPC-G04 Goal: Create a common  reference document ( this deliverable ) for similar problems 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
currently encountered (e.g., virtualization in data centres). 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
MPC-G05 Goal: Create a public reference for influencing future developments and procurement 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
activities. 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
MPC-G06 Goal: Provide input usable for work package 26 task 3 (study on modular certification). 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
MPC-G07 Goal: Provide feedback to the System Pillar Computing Environment domain. 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
MPC-G08 Goal: Enable work package 36 demonstrator and demonstrators of future R2DATO 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
Waves to incorporate and evaluate work package 26 MPC results. 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
MPC-G09 Non-Goal: Direct input for standardization. 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
MPC-G10 Non-Goal: Business analysis. 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
MPC-G11 Non-Goal: Direct input into the specification of work package 36 “On -board Platform 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
Demonstrator”, as it is not feasible from a timeline perspective. 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
3.5 ASSUMPTIONS 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
The MPC is based on several assumptions that were compiled by the work package members. 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
MPC-A01 The R2DATO Grant Agreement  describes a n MPC that is fully agnostic to its 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
environment, so that all combinations on all systems are  captured. For the actual work 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
of this work package, the scope is assumed to be trackside and on -board systems with 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
independent lifecycles of software and hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
MPC-A02 The MPC is based on the System Pillar Computing Environment domain architecture 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
concept [14], its glossary (see chapter  3.7.2) and first insights out of their work on 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
operational scenarios [15] as available by May 2024. 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
MPC-A03 The MPC’s interfaces provide the same functionality , independent of the technologies 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
used. The Functional Systems state a clear demand on resources needed for their 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
execution (memory, processing time, IO...). 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
MPC-A04 Functional Applications can assume to be free from unintended interference (from each 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
other, and other parts of the MPC). Rationale: Memory & instruction corruption, and 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
similar effects, are not allowed to happen unrecognized. 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
MPC-A05 Execution of safe and non -safe functions  in mixed critically conditions  on the same 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
hardware is possible. 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
MPC-A06 Standardized modular safety certification approaches  enriching the MPC  will be 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
investigated in work package 26 task 3. 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
MPC-A07 Resource partitioning shall only drive availability and security requirements but not safety 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
requirements in the VE (Virtualization Environment ). Rationale: IO access towards the 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
hardware from the compartment  is needed , e.g. , to access an  Ethernet controller. 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
Resources can be memory, processing time, and IO. This is true for all SIL and BI cases.

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
MPC-A08 Application specific hardware is not part of the Modular Platform Concept (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
input/output controllers for special interfaces, hardware acceleration, etc.). As such, 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
(external) communication is limited to IP-based interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
MPC-A09 There are (soft/hard) real time requirements with guaranteed reaction times equal to or 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
more than “1” second.2 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
MPC-A10 Composite fail safety (as defined by EN50129) is used in the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
3.6 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
Some aspects of the MPC are not going to be solved by this deliverable. These known issues and 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
limitations are listed in this section. A potential solution option is given where known. 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
MPC-L01 Safe reaction times are set on system level and need to be budgeted to the participating 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
functions that are implemented on a Modular Platform. This budgeting cannot be solved 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
on the Modular Platform  level, as such we cannot derive a  universal number for the 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
needed safe reaction time that is true for all possible scenarios. Timings nevertheless 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
must be specified for actual implementations later to enable the purposes stated for the 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
MPC. This information can potentially become part of the ERJU architecture, apportioned 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
for the individual functions (e.g., as already done in EULYNX). If new applications impose 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
reaction times that are beyond the scope of the MPC, a re -evaluation is necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
Potentially impacted components of the MPC: time stamping, voting, message passing, 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
and others.  

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
Solution options: discussion in work package 26 task 3; bring issue to System Pillar (SP); 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
use working assumption of 0.5 up to 1 seconds; use EULYNX numbers as an initial 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
working hypothesis. 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
MPC-L02 Modular certification to enable all multi-vendor scenarios is not solved right now.  

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
Solution options : discussion in work package 26 task 3; wait for SP PRAMS domain 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
results. 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
MPC-L03 The b enefits analysis depends on potential future demonstration activities (e.g. , in  

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
R2DATO phase 2) of the MPC as presented in this deliverable. 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
MPC-L04 Requirements towards the platform from applications in the R2DATO and ERJU context 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
are missing.  

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
Solution options: Re-visit in R2DATO phase 2 when application needs are clearer. 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
MPC-L05 Specific hardware acceleration for ML applications is excluded and for future work. 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
3.7 ALIGNMENT WITH ERJU SYSTEM PILLAR ACTIVITIES 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
The Europe’s Rail Joint Undertaking (ERJU) System Pillar  (SP) Computing Environment (CE) 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
domain is working on modular computing environments for the railway. The domain’s goal is a 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
holistic top-down approach, staying agnostic to implementation details  and especially towards 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
2 This number in isolation is not helpful for the Modular Platform specification. It is a budgeting issue from the system level 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
to appropriate the reaction times  across participating systems . See known issue  MPC-L01 in chapter 3.6 for a detailed 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
discussion.

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
trackside and on -board differences3. So far, the domain has released two deliverables:  

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
“Recommendation on interfaces to be standardised”  [14] (referred to as “RIS”  in this chapter)  and 

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
“Operational Analysis Specification (OAS)” [15]. Furthermore, the domain is maintaining the glossary 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
(see later in this document’s chapter  3.7.2). Both documents and the aligned glossary are crucial 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
inputs for the Modular Platform Concept in work package 26 and build its basis. 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
Other domains of relevance are the SP Transversal CCS (TCCS) domain and the SP PRAMSS 

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
domain. The alignment is captured in dedicated subchapters. 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
3.7.1 ERJU SP CE domain: RIS 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
The RIS  [14] derived computing-relevant user stories from the  “Common Business Objectives” 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
provided by the System Pillar [16]. In summary, the user stories are asking for advanced functionality 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
not available in today’s railway - or on-board infrastructure, such as  remote updates or hardware 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
replacement with minimal  (re-)certification effort (see also chapter  3.9). The user stories were 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
assessed towards their benefits. Subsequently, an architecture was derived, together with a set of  

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
five interfaces named I1 to I5 (see below in Figure 2). 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
The interfaces are as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
• I1: External Diagnostics, Logging, Orchestration & IT Security Interface 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
o IF-DIAGNOSTICS 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
o IF-LOGGING 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
o IF-ORCHESTRATION 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
o IF-IT-SEC 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
• I2: Hardware Abstraction Interface 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
• I3: Virtualisation Interface 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
• I4: Basic Integrity Platform Independence Interface 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
• I5: Safe Platform Independence Interface 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
In its initial planning, WP26 did not address resp. expect work ing on hardware and virtualization 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
topics (I2 and I3). Nevertheless, to reach a useful description  level for a Modular Platform Concept 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
following the input from the SP CE domain, it is necessary to include those, at least by defining 

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
assumptions and requirements (see chapter 6 for this new topic). 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
Several deployment options based on the architecture and the interface definition were given as 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
examples. These examples are illustrated in Figure 3, showing five ways how the layers could be 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
used, or their functionality included into solutions spanning multiple interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
In a next step, user stories were mapped to these interfaces and a feasibility assessment per story 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
was conducted, giving individual analyses for basic integrity and SIL applications before deriving an 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
overall feasibility conclusion. Individual cost assess ments on all five interfaces were the next step. 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
3 For example, so far, the SP CE domain did not touch on on -board specifics, such as IO needs and interfacing to 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
specialized hardware that would still be considered COTS, albeit not in the form of “standard servers”, as there are standard 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
hardware systems from some suppliers available. Another example could be Subset 147, which is Ethernet based, needed 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
for on-board systems in the future and likely to be supported by the same specialized COTS hardware.

3.7.2 ERJU SP CE domain: Glossary 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
The goal of the Modular Platforms Glossary is to establish a common understanding of the terms 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
used in this document and within the context of modular computing platforms in ERJU. This ongoing 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
process of alignment and term definition is informed by our pre vious deliverables D26.1  [18], 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
D26.2 [19], and the SP CE domain Glossary (as found in  [15]). In cases where we were not aware 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
of an existing definition, any additional content included here should be considered as input to the 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
SP CE domain and other relevant areas. 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
We recognize the alignment and development of a comprehensive glossary as a crucial activity for 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
the successful implementation of modular platforms. 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
The diagram presented below showcases the essential components of the domain -specific 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
terminology employed in describing Modular Platforms. These terminologies adhere to the 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
definitions outlined by the System Pillar Computing Environment Domain. To provide  a 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
comprehensive representation, the diagram incorporates two representations from the SP  CE 

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
domain. It includes the interfaces between different layers and also highlights the connection to the 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
central management system(s). By incorporating these elements, the diagram offers a holistic view 

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
of the key components and their relationships within the Modular Platforms framework.

Note: In a real-world scenario, it is important to consider the interfaces between different functional 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
systems, commonly referred to as “I0”4 interfaces. These interfaces facilitate communication and 

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
interaction between various systems. However, for the sake of simplicity, the diagram provided

The diagram above utilizes a specific notation to represent instances and replicas: 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
• The letters in the diagram represent the abbreviations for each corresponding entity. To 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
understand the abbreviations used, please refer to the table provided below. 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
• Each abbreviation is followed by a hyphen and a number, which serves to differentiate 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
between different kinds of the same entity. 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
• Instances of an entity are denoted by round brackets enclosing a number. 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
• Replicas of an entity, whether for safety or availability purposes, are denoted by square 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
brackets enclosing a letter. 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
This notation enables clear identification and distinction of entities, instances, and replicas within the 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
diagram. 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
Examples: 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
CP-1(1):  The first instance of Compartment kind one 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
RTE-1(2):  The second instance of Runtime Environment kind one 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---

3.7.3 ERJU SP CE domain: OAS 

--- Document Chunk 1162 ---
The second deliverable of the ERJU SP CE domain  – called “Operational Analysis Specification” 

--- Document Chunk 1163 ---
(OAS, as of June 2024) [15] – contains an updated terminology (that was considered for the aligned 

--- Document Chunk 1164 ---
glossary of chapter 3.7.2) and focuses on discussing operational aspects in the context of I1, I2 and 

--- Document Chunk 1165 ---
I3 (see chapter  3.7.1). Here, operational scenarios, an operational context and a first collection of 

--- Document Chunk 1166 ---
operational requirements is developed for the computing environment (see chapter 3.10). 

--- Document Chunk 1167 ---
The operational context of the OAS shows exemplary deployment scenarios for Functional Systems 

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
in different configurations and with differing safety goals. Furthermore, a Functional System is 

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
defined to consist of the following: 

--- Document Chunk 1170 ---
• all Functional System Compartments 

--- Document Chunk 1171 ---
• Functional System Deployment Rules

--- Document Chunk 1178 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1179 ---
The operational scenarios discussed in the OAS are categorized into 4 categories: 

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
• Integration: The act and pre-conditions of bringing a new item into the operational system. 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
• Deployment: Actual manipulations on computing elements (physical or virtual) 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
• Update: Scenarios for changing of different in-place elements 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
• Recovery: Reactions to different failure scenarios. 

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
The operational scenarios are used  later in this document to derive requirements for the internal 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
interfaces of the modular computing platform, see chapter 8. 

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
Relevant Actors and Entities are introduced in the OAS as well. 

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
The OAS also derives a first set of requirements bases on the operational context and scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
given. They are categorized into three categories: Hardware, Safety and Availability and 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
Virtualization. A subset of the requirements is captured in this document in Appendix A. 

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
3.7.4 ERJU SP TCCS domain 

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
The ERJU SP Transversal CCS (TCCS) domain is working on overarching topics. For the MPC, their 

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
work on diagnosis, configuration and update is relevant. Nevertheless, work package 26 expects the 

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
3.7.5 ERJU SP PRAMS domain 

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---

3.8.1 Safety 

--- Document Chunk 1218 ---
For a modular computing platform that targets applications like interlockings, functional safety is a 

--- Document Chunk 1219 ---
property that influences almost every aspect of the concept presented here. Even if the MPC is used 

--- Document Chunk 1220 ---
in scenarios where only Basic Integrity software is necessary, there are still  requirements to be 

--- Document Chunk 1221 ---
fulfilled from a regulatory standpoint, especially if modularity concepts are used. 

--- Document Chunk 1222 ---
Therefore, t he MPC  will enable most of its advantages if it’s embedded into a modular safety 

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
certification approach. As per the MPC purpose  MPC-P03 and assumption  MPC-A05, all safety 

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
integrity levels ranging from Basic Integrity up to SIL 4 are to be supported, with the expectation that 

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
Functional Systems almost always will contain elements with different SIL requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
While the concept presented here takes into account all needs that arise from a potential standards-

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
compliant implementation of the MPC, the scope of Task 2 of work package 26 – which is the context 

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
for this deliverable – is not including a full safety analysis. A study on modular platform certification 

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
is the topic for the work package’s Task 3, which will document its findings in deliverable D26.4. The 

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
expectation there is to align with the work of the SP PRAMSS domain, see chapter 3.7.5. 

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
In the meantime, insights into how to approach modular safety for state -of-the-art systems can, for 

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
example, be found in the “SIL4 Cloud” [3] and “SIL4 Data Center” [4] research reports. 

--- Document Chunk 1233 ---
For a layered architecture with FS compartments of different safety levels running aggregated on a 

--- Document Chunk 1234 ---
virtualization environment, it’s essential to define the safety architecture and to identify the safety 

--- Document Chunk 1235 ---
related requirements which arise by SW based SE running on COTS hardware , f or this see 

--- Document Chunk 1236 ---
chapter 6.7. 

--- Document Chunk 1237 ---
3.8.2 Security 

--- Document Chunk 1238 ---
For modular platforms, appropriate cybersecurity approaches need to be identified that match their 

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
needs. In general, all relevant interfaces and layers of the modular platforms architecture have a 

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
need for special cybersecurity requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
Within the System Pillar the cyber security  domain is responsible for the high level security 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
architecture and requirements which includes and are applicable to the modular platform.

The secure component specification is based on previous work done in EULYNX BL 4 R2 and ESCG 

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
and is based on the following standards. 

--- Document Chunk 1261 ---
• IEC 62443-4-2 Ed 1 

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
• ESCG Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1263 ---
• UNISIG Subset 146 v4.00 

--- Document Chunk 1264 ---
• UNISIG Subset 147 v4.00 

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
• CEN TS 50701/IEC PT 63452 

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---
It describes the cyber security requirements for secure components like the modular platform which 

--- Document Chunk 1267 ---
include for example hardening, encryption, certificate usage and making use of the shared security 

--- Document Chunk 1268 ---
services and secure communication.  

--- Document Chunk 1269 ---
3.8.2.2 Secure Communication Specification  

--- Document Chunk 1270 ---
The secure communication specification is based on previous work done in EULYNX BL 4 R2 and 

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
ESCG and is based on the following standards. 

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
• UNISIG Subset 146 v4.00 

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
• RFC8446 The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
It describes the requ irements for the secure communication which are needed to communicate 

--- Document Chunk 1281 ---
between secure components . In case of the modular platform this will include communication 

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
between functional system compartments and from functional system compartments to external 

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
systems and shared services which require secure communication. 

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
3.8.2.3 Shared Security Services  

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
The shared security services specification is based on previous work done in EULYNX BL 4 R2 , 

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
ESCG and UNISIG Subset 146 v4.00. 

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
The specification defines the interfaces to the Shared Security Services which the modular platform 

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
will use and are required for interoperability in and harmonization of the European rail automation 

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
domain.  

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
The Shared Security Services include the following services which can be used by applications on-

--- Document Chunk 1291 ---
board a trainset or by trackside applications: 

--- Document Chunk 1292 ---
• STS - Secure Time Synchronisation - service for secure time synchronisation to Secure 

--- Document Chunk 1293 ---
Components 

--- Document Chunk 1294 ---
• PKI - Public Key Infrastructure - service for distributing certificates and their status to Secure 

--- Document Chunk 1295 ---
Components, crucial for all secure communication 

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
• IAM - Identity and Access Management - service for managing digital identities (human users 

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
and assets) 

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
• NAC - Network Access Control - service for identifying, authenticating, and authorizing 

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
network access of Secure Components 

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
• LOG - Security Logging - service for collecting log messages from Secure Components and 

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
relaying log messages (e.g. to another relay or SIEM) 

--- Document Chunk 1302 ---
• SSO - Single Sign On - service for managing roles for authorisation and single-sign on (SSO) 

--- Document Chunk 1303 ---
Comment: SSI-SSO is not needed when there is no human userlog in (e.g. on embedded 

--- Document Chunk 1304 ---
devices) 

--- Document Chunk 1305 ---
• BKP - Backup and Restore - service for creating and restoring backups to/from Secure 

--- Document Chunk 1306 ---
Components 

--- Document Chunk 1307 ---
Comment: SSI-BKP is not needed when there is nothing to backup (e.g. on devices without 

--- Document Chunk 1308 ---
state with fixed configuration) 

--- Document Chunk 1309 ---
• DNS - Domain Name System - service for name resolution to map domain names to IP 

--- Document Chunk 1310 ---

Figure 9: Hierarchy and interfaces of shared services 

--- Document Chunk 1319 ---
The figure above includes: 

--- Document Chunk 1320 ---
• the Shared Security Services which offer Shared Security Interfaces (SSI) to Secure 

--- Document Chunk 1321 ---
Components 

--- Document Chunk 1322 ---
• the Enterprise Security Services (ESS), which offer Enterprise Security Interfaces (ESI) to 

--- Document Chunk 1323 ---
SSS 

--- Document Chunk 1324 ---
• external services on a national level used by the ESS 

--- Document Chunk 1325 ---
Nevertheless, the cybersecurity aspects of the modular platforms need to be aligned with the 

--- Document Chunk 1326 ---
appropriate SP domains, e.g., PRAMS, and they need to be analysed from the perspective of both, 

--- Document Chunk 1327 ---
on-board and trackside, deployment options. This work is ongoing. 

--- Document Chunk 1328 ---
For a layered architecture with FS compartments of different safety levels running aggregated on a 

--- Document Chunk 1329 ---
virtualization environment, it’s essential to define the  security architecture and identify the security 

--- Document Chunk 1330 ---
related requirements for the individual SW layers, for this see chapter 6.8. 

--- Document Chunk 1331 ---
3.8.3 PRAM 

--- Document Chunk 1332 ---
The remaining letters of the PRAMSS acron ym are briefly brought into context of the MPC in the 

--- Document Chunk 1333 ---
following sections. 

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
Performance (P) 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
The MPC will need to assure performance guarantees to the functions ( implemented in the form of 

--- Document Chunk 1336 ---
Functional Systems and their components) . This is handled via a description of what level of 

--- Document Chunk 1337 ---
performance is necessary (e.g., computing resources resp. time) in a defined format. This description 

--- Document Chunk 1338 ---
can potentially be a part of the FS deployment rules (FSDR). 

--- Document Chunk 1339 ---
Reliability (R) 

--- Document Chunk 1340 ---
The MPC will allow assessment of the reliability properties and influences , determining safety and 

--- Document Chunk 1341 ---
availability.

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
Availability (A) 

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
The flexibility to reach necessary availability goals for a given function is part of the MPC, e.g., by 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
allowing different redundancy configurations. 

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
For a layered architecture with FS compartments of different safety levels running aggregated on a 

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
virtualization environment, it’s essential to identify and define the needed requirements from view of 

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
availability, for this see chapter 6.9. 

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
Maintainability (M) 

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
To reach expected maintainability goals, the MPC includes fault detection and identification services 

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
like diagnostics and logging and offers clearly defined interfaces to allow maintenance and 

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
restoration of a failed system (see also chapter 6.11). 

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
3.9 USER STORIES 

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
As mentioned in chapter  3.7.1, the first SP CE domain deliverable (RIS, [14]) introduced thirteen 

--- Document Chunk 1360 ---
user stories. They are derived from the SP “Common Business Objectives”  [16]. The user stories  

--- Document Chunk 1361 ---
with their advanced expectation towards a modular railway computing platform build the basis for 

--- Document Chunk 1362 ---
the work of the SP CE domain and also the MPC. Several important user stories are given here, for 

--- Document Chunk 1363 ---
all user stories and their details please refer to the RIS [14].

3.10 OPERATIONAL CONTEXT AND OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS 

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
The SP CE domain “OAS” deliverable [15], as introduced in chapter 3.7.3, discusses the operational 

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
context and several operational scenarios based on the terminology  given in chapter 3.7.2 and the 

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
basic ideas from their first deliverable, “RIS” [14], as introduced in chapter 3.7.1. 

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
A general assumption for both, operational context and scenarios, is, that  the activities are focused 

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
on Functional Systems. This is a result of the SP CE domain’s “main objective of standardising the 

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
Computing Environment […] to enable the operation of Functional Systems from various suppliers 

--- Document Chunk 1401 ---
on a shared pool of physical computing resources”  [15]. Depending on the needs of the FS, as 

--- Document Chunk 1402 ---
documented in its FS deployment rules (FSDR), different scenarios are given as examples for their 

--- Document Chunk 1403 ---
configuration. These needs depend on requirements towards availability, redundancy, and additional 

--- Document Chunk 1404 ---
safety related measures. 

--- Document Chunk 1405 ---
1. FS (#1) implementing a 2-out-of-3 redundancy configuration using three compartments. The 

--- Document Chunk 1406 ---
compartments each need to be run on a distinct piece of physical hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 1407 ---
2. FS (#2) implementing the same configuration as above, but also including a fourth 

--- Document Chunk 1408 ---
compartment with Basic Integrity software only, that has no further need for redudancy  and 

--- Document Chunk 1409 ---
could be deployed on any suitable physical hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 1410 ---
3. FS (#3) implementing a 1 -out-of-2 redundancy  configuration using two compartments with 

--- Document Chunk 1411 ---
Basic Integrity software. The redundancy goal can only be achieved when the compartments 

--- Document Chunk 1412 ---
are run on distinct piece of physical hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
For FS #1 and #2, an application specific communications interface I0 is used between the two. As 

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
this I0 interface is highly specific, it’s out of scope for the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 1415 ---
The operational scenarios discussed in the OAS focus on the FS resp. compartment level. As such, 

--- Document Chunk 1416 ---
the learnings later derived for the MPC are mostly relevant for  the internal handling of the 

--- Document Chunk 1417 ---
compartments (hardware independence approach, see chapter  5.4) and the interface exposed to 

--- Document Chunk 1418 ---
facilitate the necessary operations and status  collection (external interfaces, see chapter  7.4.6.1). 

--- Document Chunk 1419 ---
The overview of the  scenarios as discussed in the OAS is given in the following list. For details, 

--- Document Chunk 1420 ---

3.11 INTENDED USAGE SCENARIOS 

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
For a discussion around usage scenarios for the MPC, two cases must be differentiated: The usage 

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
of the Modular Platform Concept (as described in this deliverable) and the usage of actual platform 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
implementations compatible to the MPC (CPI – compatible platform implementation). 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
MPC Usage Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
The MPC can be used to implement platforms that are compatible to the principles as outlined in this 

--- Document Chunk 1463 ---
deliverable. As the deliverable itself is not a directly implementable specification, additional 

--- Document Chunk 1464 ---
subsequent steps are necessary for  full standardization of the relevant interfaces to unlock the 

--- Document Chunk 1465 ---
potential benefits described in the previous chapters. 

--- Document Chunk 1466 ---
Nevertheless, to research the feasibility of the MPC, the information and design proposals from this 

--- Document Chunk 1467 ---
deliverable can be used to guide  future work. Especially for the highly recommended – as per 

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
RIS [14] – interfaces for the operation of compartments (I2, I3) and the integration of CPI into a 

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
bigger IT/OT landscape (I1), prototypes can be built on this deliverable, enhancing the specification. 

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
The MPC itself can also be used as a basis for the definition of prototypes and demonstrators, such 

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
as the work package 36 “On-board Platform Demonstrator”. 

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
CPI Usage Scenarios Examples 

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
As the MPC is one unified concept, various implementations of the MPC (referred to as CPI, see 

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
above) are possible and are expected to be tailored to their use case and environment.  Example 

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
types of CPI are given here, without the list being exhaustive: 

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
• Platforms for small, on-premises trackside data centres that are used to operate interlockings

FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 42 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
• Platforms for medium sized, centralized trackside data centres that are used to operate 

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
multiple interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
• Platforms for larger, centralized trackside data centres that are used to operate multiple 

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
interlockings from diverse areas, potentially also offering georedundacy for other data centres 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
• Platforms for consolidated on -board functionality, especially in CCS areas were frequent 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
updates are to be expected or functionality will be added later in the lifecycle 

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
There are of course smaller scenarios where the MPC in general might not be suitable, e.g., for 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---
single object controllers and similar single -function, potentially embedded systems. Here, CPIs are 

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
not expected to be available. 

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
3.12 PLATFORM ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLES 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
For the MPC, two platform environment examples are shown in this chapter . These examples are 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
included to try to complement all the information regarding MPC  and show a potential mapping of 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
abstract terms like FS and FA. The first one is about wayside and the second one is about on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
These examples do not include an exhaustive list, neither for the functional systems nor for functional 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
applications, and are not trying to define MPC usage. Both platform environment examples are 

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
proposed following the Figure 5 introduced in chapter 3.7.2 (ERJU SP CE domain: Glossary). 

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
The principal concepts concerning the Glossary are Functional Systems (FS) and Functional 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
Application (FA). In the following figures, they are represented as green (FS) and in blue (FA). 

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
Concerning the wayside environment and subsequently to Figure 10, RBC and Interlocking systems 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
are used as examples. 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
Figure 10: Trackside environment for MPC 

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
The first functional system proposed on a trackside environment is the RBC.  In this case it can be 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
distinguished different functional applications such as a management of a MA, a management of 

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
TSR or a management of an End of Mission among other.  These three functional applications are 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
some examples proposed for this concrete functional system, but there are not the only ones, and it 

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
can be more functional applications for a functional system.

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
Regarding RBC concept, it could be several RBC working as functional systems on different 

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
instances just because on a same train route there are different RBC to connect. 

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
As there is a functional system for the RBC it will also another one for the Interlocking System. The 

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
functional application s proposed  for this functional system are the signal controller, the point 

--- Document Chunk 1520 ---
controller and level crossing controller among others. 

--- Document Chunk 1521 ---
Concerning on -board environment and subsequently to Figure 11, it is proposed another four 

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
concepts working as functional systems, ETCS, FRMCS, ATO and National System. 

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
Figure 11: On-board environment for MPC 

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---
The first functional system proposed to run in an an on-board environment is the ETCS concept. 

--- Document Chunk 1526 ---
According to ETCS concept understood as a functional system, DMI function and BTM are some 

--- Document Chunk 1527 ---
platforms environment examples for functional application. 

--- Document Chunk 1528 ---
The second functional system proposed for the on-board environment is FRMCS. Pursuant to 

--- Document Chunk 1529 ---
FRMCS functional system, some examples of functional applications can be found. These functional 

--- Document Chunk 1530 ---
applications are the gateway function and the radio function. 

--- Document Chunk 1531 ---
For the on-board domain, another functional system proposed is the ATO concept. Driver functions 

--- Document Chunk 1532 ---
and timing point management are the examples proposed as functional applications. 

--- Document Chunk 1533 ---
The last functional system proposed is the ATP national System. The functional application for this 

--- Document Chunk 1534 ---
functional system depends on the national system itself, so, as it was for the ETCS concept, the 

--- Document Chunk 1535 ---
BTM and DMI function shall be examples of functional application for this functional system.

4 MODULAR PLATFORMS REQUIREMENTS 

--- Document Chunk 1543 ---
Based on the aspects of the Modular Platform Concept as described and discussed in the previous 

--- Document Chunk 1544 ---
chapter, the next step is to create a set of relevant requirements. These requirements are the basis 

--- Document Chunk 1545 ---
for architectural work in the next chapter. 

--- Document Chunk 1546 ---
Requirements towards railway -suitable (modular) computing platforms have been defined  in the 

--- Document Chunk 1547 ---
past, as discussed in this work package’s first deliverable  [18]. Requirements defined in the past  

--- Document Chunk 1548 ---
usually have a distinction between trackside and on-board systems, depending on their context. For 

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
providing a more generic set of requirements, this work package aims to remove this distinction 

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
where feasible, potentially only containing some optional  and specialized  requirements. The 

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
following briefly discusses the potential sources for this work. 

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
Project Discussion 

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
computing platform requirements. In particular the document OCORA TWS03-

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---

5 MODULAR PLATFORMS ARCHITECTURE 

--- Document Chunk 1580 ---
The Modular Platform is a computing environment for the execution of mixed-critically workloads, 

--- Document Chunk 1581 ---
offering the central benefits of allowing portability, flexibility and re-use of business logic captured as 

--- Document Chunk 1582 ---
application software, the so called “Functional Applications” ( for this and other term s’ definition, 

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
please refer to the glossary in chapter 3.7.2). To enable these benefits, following the previous work 

--- Document Chunk 1584 ---
and SP CE domain inputs  (see chapter  3.7), three distinct domains for the Modular Platform s 

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
Concept architecture were derived: 

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
• Application-Level Platform Independence (ALPI) 

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
• Hardware-Level Platform Independence (HLPI) 

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
• Interfaces external to the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
Here, the notion of “platform independence” refers to the independence of an actual implementation 

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
respectively instantiation of the Modular Platform concept  (CPI, see chapter  3.11). The relation 

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
between the domains is shown in the following diagram. 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
How these three domains fulfil the goals of the Modular Platform is explained in detail in the three 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
dedicated subsequent main chapters. In this overview chapter, the next figure will show how the 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
Modular Platform domains implement the SP CE domain interface recommendations and enable the 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
known operational scenarios, using an enriched version of the figure above. Here, the division of SP

Figure 13: SP CE domain interfaces mapped to the Modular Platform domains 

--- Document Chunk 1625 ---
As shown, the interface I1 is encompassing Modular Platform related and relevant interfaces which 

--- Document Chunk 1626 ---
are external to the platform, for example for update and configuration purposes. Interface I1 is not 

--- Document Chunk 1627 ---
used for Functional Application communication, e.g., for interfacing to object controllers in an 

--- Document Chunk 1628 ---
interlocking application. For this  business logic relevant communication, the SP CE domain 

--- Document Chunk 1629 ---
introduced a generic I0 interface [15], which is out of scope for the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
Interfaces I2 and I3 are providing means for hardware abstraction and, if needed, aggregation 

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
respectively integration of multiple runtime environments (inside of compartments)  running on the 

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
same hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
Interfaces I4 and I5 are used by a Functional Application to implement its business logic in a platform 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
independent manner. A Functional Application may contain both, safe and non -safe functionality, 

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
using I4 and I5, respectively. 

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
Between the SP CE domain interfaces  (I1 and I2…I5) , common parts are needed for the 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
implementation of an actual computing platform, as shown in Figure 14 below. 

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
These common parts, also called “layers” by the SP CE domain, will be discussed later in the 

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
document, and are at this stage only used to illustrate potential usage scenarios for the interfaces I1 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
to I5. Also, for the functionality shown within I1, the naming from the SP CE domain has not been 

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
used here, as there are some differences proposed in chapter 8.

5.1 MODULARIZATION ARCHITECTURE 

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
The MPC is a truly modular environment when it’s agnostic towards  multiplicities and tasks of the 

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
physical (e.g., hardware) and logical components (e.g., software executing a business logic). Taking 

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
the approach from the previous chapter  – the distinction of three MPC domains – and focusing on 

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
the two providing independence methodologies (HLPI and ALPI), the modular setup of physical and 

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
logical components can be introduced using simple examples. 

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
First, in the context of HLPI  (Hardware-level Platform Independence) , the flexible deployment of 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
Functional Systems  onto Physical Computing Elements  being part of a Compartment Execution 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
Environment is shown. 

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
Afterwards, the construction of CPs using the ALPI approach is discussed. 

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
This is done using the terms and naming conventions established in chapter 3.7.2. 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
5.1.1 HLPI Modularization Architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
Functional Systems are, on a high  level, a collection of Compartments that together implement a 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
certain business logic. They can be seen as a deliverable by a supplier that  an end-user wants to 

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
deploy onto its CPI consisting of one or more Compartment Execution Environments (CEE). 

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
HLPI provides the ability to execute a certain number of Compartments (CP)  on a single Physical 

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
Computing Element (PCE). Several PCEs can be part of a single CEE. Compartments are belonging 

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
to a Functional System  (FS) and only are of value when they are deployed as described in its 

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
individual FS Deployment Rules (FSDR) , in accordance with their approval documents . The 

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
generalized view is shown in Figure 15 below. 

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
Figure 15: Modularization enabled by FS Compartments on HLPI 

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
For an exemplary FS that employs a 2oo2 (2 out of 2 ) configuration, the FSDR states that  two 

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
Compartments need to be deployed on separate PCEs. How this can look like after deployment is 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
show in Figure 16 below. Here, the CEE only hosts the exemplary FS . The Compartments are 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
supported by the HLPI mechanisms present on each PCE. 

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---
Figure 16: Example deployment of a single 2oo2 FS into one CEE 

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
A more complicated – but hypothetical – setup employing two different FS, one 2oo2 and one 2oo3, 

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
is being deployed on a pool of three PCEs in the next example, as shown in Figure 17. Here, MPC-

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
P06 (Consolidating more software on less hardware. ) implicates that CPs from different FS can be 

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
executed on the same PCE  while being free from interference according to MPC-A04. Therefore, 

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
only three PCEs are needed to execute five CPs belonging to two FS. 

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
How exactly the CPs are distributed over the available PCEs is not important for the MPC except for 

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
conditions defined in the individual FSDRs. With FSDR, FS-specific rules for deployment can be 

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
demanded. This would mostly be used to state that CPs belonging to redundancy configurations 

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
have to be executed on distinct PCEs, but could also be used to make sure special applications like 

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
2x2oo2 has groups of CPs executed in different locations (within a data centre, e.g. different fire 

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
protection zones, or even outside of a single data centre, e.g. for georedundancy).

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
Figure 17: Example deployment of a 2oo2 FS and a 2oo3 FS into one CEE 

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
Further examples can be constructed, especially as there is no limit to the number of CPs and FSDR 

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
complexity in a single FS. Of course, also simple single -CP examples for Basic Integrity usage not 

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
employing redundancy could be constructed. For the purpose of this description of HLPI modularity 

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
for the MPC, the two examples already given should be sufficient. 

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
5.1.2 ALPI Modularization Architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
Where in the HLPI context, as shown in the chapter before, the deployment of CPs onto  a CEE is 

--- Document Chunk 1709 ---
shown, the ALPI context is concerned with integrating Functional Applications (FA) into the CPs. It’s 

--- Document Chunk 1710 ---
a step that can be seen as a supplier implementing a business logic and packaging it into CPs to be 

--- Document Chunk 1711 ---
bundled up to a full FS, together with the FSDR and approval documents. 

--- Document Chunk 1712 ---
The relevant difference is, however, that there is no mandate to employ ALPI methods to build  

--- Document Chunk 1713 ---
suitable CPs, in order to allow the packaging of legacy or other software into CPs. For future projects, 

--- Document Chunk 1714 ---
using the ALPI approach can be beneficial, though, especially when needing access to the services 

--- Document Chunk 1715 ---
available in the MPC using I4, as introduced later in chapter 5.2. 

--- Document Chunk 1716 ---

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
When employing ALPI, within a CP  the Runtime Environment (RTE) and the Safety Environment 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
(SE) together with their interfaces I4 and I5  are provided for the Functional Application  (FA) to be 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
used. A potential use -case could be to use a  CP without FA , supplied by a platform vendor , and 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
install a FA into this CP. This kind of “empty” CP – where empty is referring to the missing FA – could 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
come prepared with all necessary services, the RTE and the SE, so that the FA developer can focus 

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
on implementing the business logic. Also, updates to any component in such an “empty” CP would 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
be feasible in a generalized way , leading to installing the specific FA into updated  (and potentially 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
pre-verified) CPs. 

--- Document Chunk 1732 ---
In the following figure, such an “empty” Compartment containing the ALPI components RTE and SE 

--- Document Chunk 1733 ---
is called ALPI-CP. This also implies that interfaces I4 and, where necessary, I5 are available within 

--- Document Chunk 1734 ---
this kind of CP to be used for FA development. 

--- Document Chunk 1735 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1736 ---
Figure 19: Installing an FA into an ALPI-CP to create a FS CP 

--- Document Chunk 1737 ---
Depending on the needs of the FA, multiple CPs with different numbers of FA Tasks (FAT) can be 

--- Document Chunk 1738 ---
created in this process. The multiplicities for these different redundancy configurations are not shown 

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
here. Also, the remaining FS artefacts FSDR and approval documents are not covered here, as are 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
all implications that would result from a full configuration management. 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
5.2 SERVICE ARCHITECTURE 

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
While the previous chapter was focusing on how indiv idual Functional Systems are constructed in 

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
the MPC, these FS have to rely on different services available to them and within the MPC. Many of 

--- Document Chunk 1744 ---
the advantages of the MPC are in fact dependent on a multitude of services that provide, together 

--- Document Chunk 1745 ---
with appropriate external interfaces, the ways to build, deploy and maintain a full MPC system. 

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
As envisioned by the SP CE domain, s ervice and management functionalities as remote update, 

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
diagnosis, IT-security are defined and provided separately: 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
a) by ERJU as one generic rail standard for all aspects relevant for the rail systems 

--- Document Chunk 1749 ---
b) by standard IT solutions for the aspects in context of VE, depending on the selected solution 

--- Document Chunk 1750 ---
of the VE. 

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
This separation has an impact to the service architecture and  on the  external interfaces of the 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
platform. When the Compartment Execution Environment (CEE) itself cannot be expected to provide 

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
a standardized interface – due to allowing multiple options for standard IT solutions, only limited by 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
the fact that these solutions need to fulfil the requirements  towards them – additional entities have

--- Document Chunk 1760 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1761 ---
to be defined to bridge these differences. These architectural components are introduced on a high 

--- Document Chunk 1762 ---
level in this chapter and are further detailed and explained, as well as their interfaces, in chapter 8. 

--- Document Chunk 1763 ---
5.2.1 High Level Service Architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1764 ---
Figure 20 below shows the relationship between components within a CPI  (compatible platform 

--- Document Chunk 1765 ---
implementation, e.g., a product  complying to MPC , see also  chapter 3.11), and introduces the 

--- Document Chunk 1766 ---
entities Shared Services, Platform Management , CEE, and their accompanying  interfaces. The 

--- Document Chunk 1767 ---
relationships are shown for an arbitrary number of FS within a CPI. The interfaces are shown in the 

--- Document Chunk 1768 ---
same colour as the components that are responsible for their respective specification. 

--- Document Chunk 1769 ---

Figure 20: High Level MPC service architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1771 ---
Compartment Execution & Management Environment (CEME) 

--- Document Chunk 1772 ---
When (exchangeable) standard IT solutions are used for the VE (Virtualization Environment) inside 

--- Document Chunk 1773 ---
CEE (Compartment Execution Environment), the assumption is that there is a technical management 

--- Document Chunk 1774 ---
tool respectively interface for the management of the whole CEME, including the PCE s, VEs and 

--- Document Chunk 1775 ---
VCEs, offered by the chosen COTS VE solution. In addition to the SP CE definition of CEE , the 

--- Document Chunk 1776 ---
CEME also provides interfaces towards the Platform Management, e.g. for tasks such as on -

--- Document Chunk 1777 ---
boarding of new PCEs, setting up the VE and creation of VCEs.  The interface, referred to in the 

--- Document Chunk 1778 ---
figure as “Orchestration & Diagnostics”, is expected to be part of the solution used and to be required 

--- Document Chunk 1779 ---
to expose the necessary functionality for CEE management. Implementation details of interfaces I2 

--- Document Chunk 1780 ---
and I3 are specific to the chosen, suitable VE solution, and are not shown here. 

--- Document Chunk 1781 ---
Shared Services 

--- Document Chunk 1782 ---
The shared services as mentioned here are the combination of several services defined by multiple 

--- Document Chunk 1783 ---
ERJU SP domains and contain security, update and diagnostics related functionality. Specification 

--- Document Chunk 1784 ---
of them is out of scope in WP26, but highly relevant for the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 1785 ---
Platform Management 

--- Document Chunk 1786 ---
The Platform Management (PM) is a new component added to the input of the ERJU SP CE domain 

--- Document Chunk 1787 ---
and deemed necessary within the scope of the MPC . The PM controls the specific CEE, interacts

--- Document Chunk 1793 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1794 ---
with the Shared Services (via I1) and collects management -related diagnostics data from the 

--- Document Chunk 1795 ---
Functional Systems while also managing their configuration and updates. Its function within the MPC 

--- Document Chunk 1796 ---
is to enable the usage of different  suitable COTS CEEs while providing fixed interfaces (I1) to the 

--- Document Chunk 1797 ---
outside. This way, CPIs with different PCE+VE+VCE combinations still expose the same interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 1798 ---
to the outside. The PM is also providing a User Interface (UI), especially to support the user stories 

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
for the MPC as outlined in chapter 3.9. For example, central tasks of the PM are to properly deploy 

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
FS according to their FSDR , monitoring the FS’s operational state and reacting to any non -regular 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
situation that can occur . There is no guidance  from the MPC on the amount of FS managed by a 

--- Document Chunk 1802 ---
single PM, respectively the number of PCE available in a CPI.  The implementation of the PM is  

--- Document Chunk 1803 ---
expected to fulfil to Basic Integrity requirements only. 

--- Document Chunk 1804 ---
I1 

--- Document Chunk 1805 ---
The I1 connections shown in the figure are a combination of COTS interface definitions respectively 

--- Document Chunk 1806 ---
protocols for standard tasks, such as time synchronization , and additional fixed interfaces defined 

--- Document Chunk 1807 ---
by ERJU, e.g. for FS update. The I1 interacts with all, Function Systems, Platform Management and 

--- Document Chunk 1808 ---
the CEE. However, not every component has to implement or comply with the whole range of I1  

--- Document Chunk 1809 ---
functionality. Especially for the interfacing to the CEE, the assumption is that standard interfaces for 

--- Document Chunk 1810 ---
task targeting IT security are used by I1 and are available from potential COTS CEE solutions. 

--- Document Chunk 1811 ---
Detailed discussion of the interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 1812 ---
A more detailed discussion of the relevant internal and external interfaces can be found in chapter 8. 

--- Document Chunk 1813 ---
5.2.2 CEME and AEE Service Architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1814 ---
To support update and diagnostics within both, the CEME and the AEE areas, at least two non-

--- Document Chunk 1815 ---
exclusive variants of endpoints are possible. This is shown in the next figure. 

--- Document Chunk 1816 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1817 ---

--- Document Chunk 1818 ---
CP-MGMT 

--- Document Chunk 1819 ---
The Management Compartment (CP-MGMT) is a way to bridge the standard IT VE environment to 

--- Document Chunk 1820 ---
the AEE. Here, the example given in Figure 21 is the collection of hardware monitoring data (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 1821 ---
temperature measurements of certain components , see chapter  6.7) from the PCE , being

--- Document Chunk 1827 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1828 ---
transported through the VE and VCE to a n exemplary “Diagnostics Server” in the CP-MGMT. This 

--- Document Chunk 1829 ---
diagnostics server can collect the data and exchange it with the Shared Services and the PM.  

--- Document Chunk 1830 ---
Similarly, an update client can be implemented. A dedicated CP-MGMT would be dependent on the 

--- Document Chunk 1831 ---
VE used and use its methods and interfaces to access PCE , VE and VCE  data. The CP-MGMT 

--- Document Chunk 1832 ---
would be managed by the PM. Methods for achieving the data transfer from PCE to CP are discussed 

--- Document Chunk 1833 ---
in chapter 6.6 

--- Document Chunk 1834 ---
ALPI Services 

--- Document Chunk 1835 ---
When I4 or I5 are being used, the data collection can happen within the confines of the ALPI , as 

--- Document Chunk 1836 ---
shown in an example for VCE2 . Here, monitoring data of the FA execution can be collected within 

--- Document Chunk 1837 ---
the appropriate Compartment and transported to the Shared Services and PM. Similarly, an update 

--- Document Chunk 1838 ---
client would be located within the CP. 

--- Document Chunk 1839 ---
Other services 

--- Document Chunk 1840 ---
The update and diagnostics services are only two of the possible services . Security services for 

--- Document Chunk 1841 ---
APM, PKI and time synchronization are not shown here but would be integrated into the FS CPs. 

--- Document Chunk 1842 ---
Combination of CP-MGMT and FS CP 

--- Document Chunk 1843 ---
For certain implementations of MPC, it might be feasible to integrate the functionality needed within 

--- Document Chunk 1844 ---
the CP-MGMT into the normal FS CPs. This can reduce the number of CPs in a given environment, 

--- Document Chunk 1845 ---
as one CP-MGMT per PCE is necessary. However, it creates a strong dependency on a given VE 

--- Document Chunk 1846 ---
also in the normal FS CPs. Additionally, only one CP per PCE should read and report data from the 

--- Document Chunk 1847 ---
VCE, VE and PCE, to avoid exclusive access problems and double reporting issues during 

--- Document Chunk 1848 ---
operation. This creates dependencies between different FS that might not be aware of each other, 

--- Document Chunk 1849 ---
leading to further complications.

5.3 ADDITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS 

--- Document Chunk 1854 ---
The Modular Platforms Architecture imposes additional assumptions on the definition on the MPC 

--- Document Chunk 1855 ---
and its components, namely HLPI, ALPI and the external interfaces.  They augment the SP CE 

--- Document Chunk 1856 ---
domain recommendations and assumptions collected so far. 

--- Document Chunk 1857 ---
MPC-AA01 I1 shall always be used (includes potentially non -standardized orchestration 

--- Document Chunk 1858 ---
interfaces, namely the OI, and nested orchestration in future cases where  there are 

--- Document Chunk 1859 ---
containers inside VMs that need to be tended towards). 

--- Document Chunk 1860 ---
MPC-AA02 Usage of I2/I3 does not mandate I4/I5, and vice versa. 

--- Document Chunk 1861 ---
MPC-AA03 The message content when using I4 and I5 provided communication mechanisms is 

--- Document Chunk 1862 ---
not specified in/by work package 26 respective the Modular Platform Concept. 

--- Document Chunk 1863 ---
MPC-AA04 As a first step, systems that can be orchestrated based on manual human user input 

--- Document Chunk 1864 ---
via I1 , leading to a  so-called “static configuration ” are in the scope of this work 

--- Document Chunk 1865 ---
package. The Modular Platform Concept, especially the Platform Management 

--- Document Chunk 1866 ---
component, however, can in the future be expanded to include dynamic configuration 

--- Document Chunk 1867 ---
approaches. This requires the safety implications of this approach to be solved.

MPC-AA09 HLPI and ALPI use is agnostic to each other. 

--- Document Chunk 1883 ---
MPC-AA10 The deployment configuration is checked by the safety layer to ensure restricted 

--- Document Chunk 1884 ---
deployment (especially to avoid replicas to be deployed on the same physical HW). 

--- Document Chunk 1885 ---
MPC-AA11 Updates of components outside of the safe part (e.g. security updates) should not 

--- Document Chunk 1886 ---
affect the safe part uptime. 

--- Document Chunk 1887 ---
5.4 CONCLUSIONS 

--- Document Chunk 1888 ---
The Modular Platforms Architecture builds on top of the ERJU SP CE domain input and prior work 

--- Document Chunk 1889 ---
of work package 26 itself. The previous introduction of ALPI and HLPI layers helps to  simplify 

--- Document Chunk 1890 ---
systems views and the discussion , and also represents concrete areas of expertise and future 

--- Document Chunk 1891 ---
product development. 

--- Document Chunk 1892 ---
The modularization and service architecture approaches shown in this chapter build the basis for the 

--- Document Chunk 1893 ---
following chapters, detailing how HLPI, ALPI and interfaces can be specified. 

--- Document Chunk 1894 ---
From the architecture perspective, one open point remains: A combined modularization architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1895 ---
proposal showing how the deeper levels of FS (e.g., compartments, RTE, Functional Applications, 

--- Document Chunk 1896 ---
etc.) interact with the interfaces introduced in the service architecture, as well as with the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 1897 ---
Management and Shared Services (see Open-011).

6 HARDWARE-LEVEL PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE (HLPI) 

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
6.1 INTRODUCTON 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
One of the primary objectives of HLPI in this new architecture is to facilitate the integration of multiple 

--- Document Chunk 1907 ---
Functional Systems, which may originate from different suppliers and possess varying safety 

--- Document Chunk 1908 ---
integrity levels, onto a shared Physical Computing Element (i.e., hardware).  This shall be  

--- Document Chunk 1909 ---
accomplished through the implementation of a virtualization layer, which ensures maximum 

--- Document Chunk 1910 ---
hardware independence and facilitates seamless integration. 

--- Document Chunk 1911 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1912 ---
Figure 22: Aggregation of FS Compartments on same Hardware 

--- Document Chunk 1913 ---
By utilizing a standardized IT solution as a common virtualization environment, the architecture 

--- Document Chunk 1914 ---
benefits from a reliable and well -established solution. It includes all the necessary management 

--- Document Chunk 1915 ---
functionalities for efficient software orchestration. Furthermore, the streamlined management of 

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---
various commercial off -the-shelf (COTS) hardware versions and types from different suppliers will 

--- Document Chunk 1917 ---
be significantly simplified. This approach is further enhanced by the availability of qualified hardware 

--- Document Chunk 1918 ---
from multiple hardware suppliers. 

--- Document Chunk 1919 ---
To accomplish this, it is essential to define the specific interfaces between hardware, virtualization 

--- Document Chunk 1920 ---
layer, and Functional System software in alignment with the safety and security architectures. It is 

--- Document Chunk 1921 ---
important to note that the virtualization software a nd hardware are considered to be non-safety 

--- Document Chunk 1922 ---
components without safety implications, yet they must still meet all relevant security requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1923 ---
The subsequent sub -chapters provide an overview of various aspects related to the layered 

--- Document Chunk 1924 ---
architecture, including requirements for architecture elements and any outstanding issues that need 

--- Document Chunk 1925 ---
to be addressed. The primary focus is to identify requirements from the perspectives of safety (see 

--- Document Chunk 1926 ---
chapter 6.6), security (see chapter 6.8) and availability (see chapter 6.9). 

--- Document Chunk 1927 ---
6.2 ASSUMPTIONS 

--- Document Chunk 1928 ---
6.2.1 FS without direct I/O interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 1929 ---
In s cope of Computing Environments / Modular Platforms are FS with communication-based 

--- Document Chunk 1930 ---
interfaces to other FS.  

--- Document Chunk 1931 ---
 Contract No. HE – 101102001 

--- Document Chunk 1932 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 1933 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1934 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1935 ---
FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 56 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 1936 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1937 ---
The communication interfaces  between FSs shall be standardized. By this it may not make a 

--- Document Chunk 1938 ---
difference if connected other FSs are running on the same computing elements or not. Even FSs 

--- Document Chunk 1939 ---
running on specific hardware (e.g. legacy systems which are already installed) can be connected via 

--- Document Chunk 1940 ---
the same standardized communication interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 1941 ---
I/O control functionality is out of scope of HLPI. Such I/O control functionalities  need use case 

--- Document Chunk 1942 ---
specific HW solutions for the individual use cases, e.g. point controller s need other  specialized 

--- Document Chunk 1943 ---
physical functionality  and interfaces than signal controller s. By this a hardware independent 

--- Document Chunk 1944 ---
standardization of the system internal architecture of I/O controllers is not easily possible. 

--- Document Chunk 1945 ---
Functional Systems that require I/O control functionality are connected via the communication-based 

--- Document Chunk 1946 ---
interface I0 to use-case specific I/O controllers. 

--- Document Chunk 1947 ---
6.2.2 FS internal communication 

--- Document Chunk 1948 ---
Each solution of an SE supports communication-based interfaces between the FS compartments 

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
without any constraints regarding the usage of the network , as e.g. no kind of constraints as “direct 

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
LAN cables between the VCE”. 

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---
6.2.3 FS time behavior 

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
Time critical processes in HW  related functionalities are realized behind I0 within dedicated I/O 

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
controllers. 

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
Note that latency times of communication technology leads to additional delay in message 

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
processing. This must be foreseen in the overall architecture and safety case. 

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
The trackside overall architecture (interlocking, radio block centre, object controllers) is already 

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
defined in such a way that an interlocking needs to show reaction times in a range of 1−2 seconds. 

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
The new overall architecture within the on-board system must be defined in such a way that the FS 

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
can react in time ranges below 1 second, with potential real time constraints  depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
function5. Time critical processes  in HW related functionalities with faster timing requirements are 

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
realized behind I0 within the use-case specific I/O controllers. 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
6.2.4 VE as non-safe software without safety relevance 

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
The proposed safety architecture is based on a non-safety related virtualization environment. By this 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
the functionality of the virtualization environment such as e.g., task scheduling shall not affect safety, 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
but it may affect availability.  

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
Example: 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
If the scheduling of SW parts of aggregated FSs is not processed as required by the individual FS, 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
then the FS itself shall identify this problem and react in the needed way from view of safety. 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
In case of a safety related FS the safety concept of the SE must not require a specific behaviour of 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
the virtualization environment from view of safety. A misbehaviour of the virtualization environment 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
shall never affect safety, only availability. See REQ-HLPI-1. 

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
5 For example, there is a time constraint of 1 second from balise reader to brake in the ETCS on -board context. This 

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
constraint needs to be budgeted over all systems in the reaction chain.

6.2.5 Standardization Update Process for FS Compartments  

--- Document Chunk 1982 ---
It’s assumed that the process for the handling of FS Compartments in context of updating a FS is 

--- Document Chunk 1983 ---
defined by the System Pillar Transversal Group and hence out of scope for WP26. 

--- Document Chunk 1984 ---
6.3 RESOURCE PARTITIONING FOR FS COMPARTMENTS  

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
From view of availability (i.e., stable running FS compartments) it’s essential to assign physical CPU 

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
resources (e.g., cores, cache / shared bus) exclusively to individual FS compartment s. Assigning 

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
virtual cores to individual SW components within the FS compartments (e.g. Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
Replica using one CPU core exclusively) can only happen within the Compartment.  

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
The VE shall provide the mapping of CPU cores exclusively to VCE, see REQ-HLPI-2. 

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
The CPU performance provided by the mapped CPU resources must be guaranteed for every 

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
timepoint during the runtime of an FS Compartment, see REQ-HLPI-3. 

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
Parallel installation of additional FS Compartments (of other FS) in additional VCEs on the same 

--- Document Chunk 1993 ---
Virtualization Environment Instance must not have any impact on the guaranteed CPU performance 

--- Document Chunk 1994 ---
(cores) for running FS Compartments, see REQ-HLPI-4. 

--- Document Chunk 1995 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
Open point What kind of further HW architecture aspects will be “bottle necks” in parallel 

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
usage by independent FS compartments running aggregated on same 

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
computing element? Memory bandwidth? Network bandwidth?  

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---
See Open-001. 

--- Document Chunk 2000 ---
6.4 FS COMPARTMENT CONFIGURATION OF THE VE 

--- Document Chunk 2001 ---
6.4.1 Modularity and independency of VE Config for FS Compartments 

--- Document Chunk 2002 ---
The individual VE configurations of FS compartments shall be modular and independent. Each FS 

--- Document Chunk 2003 ---
Compartment shall have its own configuration for the VCE. Adding or deleting of FS compartments 

--- Document Chunk 2004 ---
onto the VE instance must not have any impact on the V CE config of the other FS  compartments. 

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
See REQ-HLPI-5. 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
6.4.2 Compatibility at VE interface 

--- Document Chunk 2007 ---
The virtualization environment shall provide defined and stable interfaces for the configuration of the 

--- Document Chunk 2008 ---
VCE usage by FS compartments. A new version of the VE may not have any impact onto the V CE 

--- Document Chunk 2009 ---
Configuration of the FS compartment. 

--- Document Chunk 2010 ---
Each change in the user interface for the V CE configuration shall be compatible in such a way that 

--- Document Chunk 2011 ---
existing VCE configs (of already running system) can be used furthermore. See REQ-HLPI-6. 

--- Document Chunk 2012 ---
6.5 INTERFACE I3 AND VE ARCHITECTURE  

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
The interface I3 of the virtualization layer describes the basic aspects regarding the virtualization 

--- Document Chunk 2014 ---
layer in context of aggregation of several systems with their own guest operatin g systems and

--- Document Chunk 2021 ---
possibly different safety criticality levels and possibly provided by several vendors, running together 

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
on the same hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
This interface I3 is not an interface in sense of "programming interface" but it's the definition of 

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
needed functionalities and features within the virtualization layer from view of the Functional Systems 

--- Document Chunk 2025 ---
running above. 

--- Document Chunk 2026 ---

Basic aspects of the different architecture variants as Container Solution (without Hypervisor) and

--- Document Chunk 2030 ---
sub-chapters. 

--- Document Chunk 2031 ---
For dependencies from the perspective of safety see chapter 6.7, for security see chapter 6.8 and 

--- Document Chunk 2032 ---
for availability see chapter 6.9. 

--- Document Chunk 2033 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---
Open point Architecture: h ow to handle the  message-based interface of the NHA  (see 

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
chapter 6.7.1) to FS Compartments above – is this interface a part of I3?  

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
See Open-002. 

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
6.5.1 Hardware Independence 

--- Document Chunk 2038 ---
One of the main goals is to achieve hardware independence at the interface I3 , is to be able to 

--- Document Chunk 2039 ---
change the used physical hardware without any impact to the FS compartments. 

--- Document Chunk 2040 ---
The runtime interface I3 of the VE shall provide HW independence for the FS compartments running 

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
above. 

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
The FS related configuration of the VCE shall be independent from the concrete used hardware.  

--- Document Chunk 2043 ---
Changing the hardware (e.g. replacing HP-servers by Fujitsu-servers) shall not have any impact onto 

--- Document Chunk 2044 ---
the VE config of the FS compartments running above, meaning it shall be possible to replace a used 

--- Document Chunk 2045 ---
physical hardware during runtime of the FS without touching the FS related configuration of the VCE. 

--- Document Chunk 2046 ---
To avoid resource consuming emulators within the VE the CPU instruction set should be defined for 

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
the interface I2, for this see chapter 6.6.  

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
HW related information, which is needed by the SE (see chapter 6.7.1), must be provided in an 

--- Document Chunk 2049 ---
abstract generic way to achieve HW independence at the interface I3.

--- Document Chunk 2056 ---
6.5.2 Container 

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---
Usage of container technology means: 

--- Document Chunk 2058 ---
• No flexibility in OS type, all FS must be based on same operating system type (e.g. Linux).  

--- Document Chunk 2059 ---
This yields the advantage, that only one OS has to be maintained. 

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
• Dependencies between the common operating system kernel and the FS running above. 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
• Weak “isolation” from view of resource usage, several FS are using same OS kernel 

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
resources. Overall integration necessary, but potentially a ressource-saving approach, e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---
for on-board, where rolling stock hardware ressouces might be limited. 

--- Document Chunk 2064 ---
• Overall performance testing necessary with different systems involved. By this it is assumed 

--- Document Chunk 2065 ---
that the integration and qualification of containerised FS Compartments  stays in the 

--- Document Chunk 2066 ---
responsibility of one single vendor or integrator. 

--- Document Chunk 2067 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2068 ---
Figure 24 Container as VE 

--- Document Chunk 2069 ---
6.5.3 Hypervisor  

--- Document Chunk 2070 ---
Usage of hypervisor technology means: 

--- Document Chunk 2071 ---
• Flexibility in type of the guest OS, each FS can be based on own operating system type (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 2072 ---
Linux, Windows), accompanying additional effort for maintaining the guest OS. 

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
• No direct technical dependencies to the FS compartments running above. 

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
• Best available solution for the “isolation” of the aggregated FS compartments from view of 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
resource usage  (cores, memory, communication) , coming along with additional ressource 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
demands and a potential higher performance decrease in comparison to containers. 

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
From view of safety a technical possibility is needed to implement functionalities running on the host 

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
operating system bare metal  on the physical computing element, see chapter  6.7 NHA (Native 

--- Document Chunk 2079 ---
Hardware Access). 

--- Document Chunk 2080 ---
From view of availability the best possible resource isolation for the FS compartments is essential. 

--- Document Chunk 2081 ---
By this the common host operating system behaviour and workload shall be as deterministic as 

--- Document Chunk 2082 ---
possible.

6.5.4 Hypervisor and Container 

--- Document Chunk 2097 ---
The combination of Hypervisor and  Containers (running within a shared virtual machine) leads to 

--- Document Chunk 2098 ---
known challenges, increasing the system complexity (e.g., for the orchestration of compartments). 

--- Document Chunk 2099 ---
As introduced in 6.5.2 and depicted in Figure 26 below, multiple Functional System compartments 

--- Document Chunk 2100 ---
running aggregated as containers in one VM raise the need of overall performance testing. Resource 

--- Document Chunk 2101 ---
isolation is n’t established in such a way that  compartments of FS -2 and FS -3 can be provided  

--- Document Chunk 2102 ---
independently, as this is the case for the FS-1 compartment deployed in a separate VM. 

--- Document Chunk 2103 ---

6.5.5 Summary 

--- Document Chunk 2112 ---
6.5.5.1 Trackside use case 

--- Document Chunk 2113 ---
For the trackside use case of a data centre the isolation and independency of the aggregated FS 

--- Document Chunk 2114 ---
is highly essential for the individual handling of FS compartments during the lifecycle of the data 

--- Document Chunk 2115 ---
centre. 

--- Document Chunk 2116 ---
If some FS as interlockings or RBCs are already running with full safety responsibility then it must 

--- Document Chunk 2117 ---
be possible to bring additional FS into the data centre without touching the running FS, even without 

--- Document Chunk 2118 ---
the need of extra integration tests of the already running FS on the VE. 

--- Document Chunk 2119 ---
By this the trackside use case needs best possible isolation of the aggregated FS. Best possible 

--- Document Chunk 2120 ---
resource p artitioning is needed to achieve independency and availability of the FS technical 

--- Document Chunk 2121 ---
interference between the aggregated FS in context of resource usage. 

--- Document Chunk 2122 ---
Such an isolation is achieved in best possible way by the usage of a hypervisor with virtual machines 

--- Document Chunk 2123 ---
for the FS compartments. From safety view some functionalities must be provided by native running 

--- Document Chunk 2124 ---
software NHA (see chapter 6.6). This means that a hypervisor is the preferred solution. 

--- Document Chunk 2125 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2126 ---
Figure 27: Trackside use case data centre: FS isolation by virtual machines 

--- Document Chunk 2127 ---
6.5.5.2 On-board use case 

--- Document Chunk 2128 ---
In the on-board use case Software changes or enhancements will not be done during the operation 

--- Document Chunk 2129 ---
of trains. A train will always be stopped for SW maintenance purposes.  By this the independent 

--- Document Chunk 2130 ---
handling of the individual FS in context of software maintenance is not as essential as for trackside.  

--- Document Chunk 2131 ---
Additionally, the physical computing element s within the train will not provide the same amount of 

--- Document Chunk 2132 ---
CPU resources as in a track side data centre, meaning the computing element resources are limited 

--- Document Chunk 2133 ---
and must be used very efficiently.  

--- Document Chunk 2134 ---
For such an on-board use case a container-based architecture will be possible to run basic integrity 

--- Document Chunk 2135 ---
software, which does not depend on a concrete SE. Such container based aggregated BIL FS must 

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
be integrated holistically to ensure the availability of the overall system.  

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
Both, hypervisors or containerised approaches are in principle appropriate as well for on-board 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
safety critical Functional Systems. Depending on concrete needs and existing constraints a trade-

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
off between flexibility, extendibility and available resources may drive a concrete solution decision. 

--- Document Chunk 2140 ---
Nevertheless, for a multi-vendor setup a hypervisor solution should be much more appropriate.

6.6 INTERFACE I2 AND HW ARCHITECTURE 

--- Document Chunk 2150 ---
The interface I2 of the hardware is not an interface in the sense of a programming interface but rather 

--- Document Chunk 2151 ---
the definition of required CPU characteristics like processor instruction set, needed CPU features 

--- Document Chunk 2152 ---
like performance, etc. from the perspective of the Functional System running aggregated on the 

--- Document Chunk 2153 ---
virtualization layer above. 

--- Document Chunk 2154 ---
In this context the topic of "flexible and HW-independent usage of HW" must be analysed regarding 

--- Document Chunk 2155 ---
the technical details of the HW which need to be defined as "generic standard".  

--- Document Chunk 2156 ---
The g oal of such a standardized architecture is to achieve full flexibility in replacing the used 

--- Document Chunk 2157 ---
hardware by another hardware without changing the software of the Functional Systems running 

--- Document Chunk 2158 ---
above. 

--- Document Chunk 2159 ---
Assumptions: 

--- Document Chunk 2160 ---
• CPU architecture is specified by I2/I3 and has to match the FSDR of deployed FS. 

--- Document Chunk 2161 ---
• No usage of CPU emulation below I3 to avoid potential issues with systematic errors in the 

--- Document Chunk 2162 ---
emulation layer. 

--- Document Chunk 2163 ---
For future proof solutions it’s essential that the safety concept of each SE solution  is basically 

--- Document Chunk 2164 ---
independent from the pro cessor instruction set to be able to change the CPU architecture without 

--- Document Chunk 2165 ---
impact to the safety concept, see REQ-HLPI-7. 

--- Document Chunk 2166 ---
A first list of potential requirements needed to define this “interface ” is following and is subject to 

--- Document Chunk 2167 ---
further study. 

--- Document Chunk 2168 ---
Requirements towards the virtualization layer above I2 

--- Document Chunk 2169 ---
• Flexible support of “incompatibilities  in detail” in context of hardware spare handling , see

6.7 SAFETY 

--- Document Chunk 2187 ---
6.7.1 HW related information for SE 

--- Document Chunk 2188 ---
For the aggregation of several FS compartments of different safety integrity levels, possibly provided 

--- Document Chunk 2189 ---
by different suppliers, on the same virtualization environment the safety architecture is essential. 

--- Document Chunk 2190 ---
Figure 29 shows the proposed safety -architecture for flexible and efficient handling of aggregated 

--- Document Chunk 2191 ---
FS (on the same computing element) possibly provided by different suppliers. For efficient handling 

--- Document Chunk 2192 ---
of safety related FS compartments running decoupled in parallel on same VE it’s essential that the 

--- Document Chunk 2193 ---
VE software below the FS compartments does not have safety relevance. Safety relevance of the 

--- Document Chunk 2194 ---
common VE layer would lead to high effort in overall integration of the FS compartments (provided 

--- Document Chunk 2195 ---
by different vendors) with the VE due to “safety related resource sharing of the VE”. So it’s proposed 

--- Document Chunk 2196 ---
that this VE software is non-safe (possibly provided by a third party). 

--- Document Chunk 2197 ---
Each solution of safety environment shall define its own safety concept in a wa y which allows the 

--- Document Chunk 2198 ---
usage of non-safe VE, each misbehaviour of the VE has to be identified by the SE and the SE must 

--- Document Chunk 2199 ---
react safe, see REQ-HLPI-1.  

--- Document Chunk 2200 ---
VE will serve information to the safety environment above, but safety responsibility is completely on 

--- Document Chunk 2201 ---
side of the SE.  

--- Document Chunk 2202 ---
The figure below shows for the basic safety architecture the SW layers running on one individual 

--- Document Chunk 2203 ---
physical computing element. This architecture is independent from the details of the safety principle 

--- Document Chunk 2204 ---
as e.g. 2oo3 or 2x2oo2, meaning it’s the same architecture for the other compartments of the up to 

--- Document Chunk 2205 ---
SIL4 FS running on other physical computing elements (but not shown in the figure).

--- Document Chunk 2212 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2213 ---
Figure 29: Safety architecture 

--- Document Chunk 2214 ---
It depends on the solution specific safety -layers which kind of behaviour and which level of 

--- Document Chunk 2215 ---
"guarantee" for this behaviour is needed by safety layers to let the safety -layer run on non-safe 

--- Document Chunk 2216 ---
virtualization layer. 

--- Document Chunk 2217 ---
As described later in this chapter, some safety related functionalities within an SE need a reliable 

--- Document Chunk 2218 ---
access to the physical computing elements.  

--- Document Chunk 2219 ---
The information cannot be created by FS compartment itself running within a virtual machine 

--- Document Chunk 2220 ---
because reliable access to underlying physical hardware is not guaranteed for SW running in a virtual 

--- Document Chunk 2221 ---
machine.  

--- Document Chunk 2222 ---
This information cannot be provided by a 3 rd party VE because it would not be able to argue the 

--- Document Chunk 2223 ---
quality of this information (by 3rd party VE) on side of the SE.  

--- Document Chunk 2224 ---
As a result, it’s necessary to provide this hardware related information by a native running reliable 

--- Document Chunk 2225 ---
software (reliable in the way that the  provided information is not influenced systematically ). This 

--- Document Chunk 2226 ---
native running software is called “Native Hardware Access (NHA)” , and this software needs direct 

--- Document Chunk 2227 ---
hardware access without influence by virtualization or emulation . Reference to 50129 is related to 

--- Document Chunk 2228 ---
ensuring the nominal operating conditions for the hardware and the system. The correct operation 

--- Document Chunk 2229 ---
can be ensured by directly monitoring the parameters (defined by NHA) or indirectly by monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 2230 ---
the behaviour of the system. The requirements and example use cases for this are described within 

--- Document Chunk 2231 ---
the next chapters. 

--- Document Chunk 2232 ---
6.7.1.1 Distribution of up to SIL4 FS Comp on different CPUs 

--- Document Chunk 2233 ---
The Safety Environment needs a reliable information about the identification of the physical CPU 

--- Document Chunk 2234 ---
hardware on which the compartment is running.  This information can be provided in the required 

--- Document Chunk 2235 ---

6.7.1.3 Independent clock source for the creation of a safe monotonic time 

--- Document Chunk 2254 ---
The SE needs to realize time related safety critical services as e.g. cyclic and synchronous replica 

--- Document Chunk 2255 ---
processing or timer-services for the FA. 

--- Document Chunk 2256 ---
To achieve a “safe monotonic time” the SE needs 2 independent monotonic clock input sources for 

--- Document Chunk 2257 ---
safety, an additional 3rd (in case of 2oo3) or even 4th (in case of 2x2oo2) independent input source 

--- Document Chunk 2258 ---
for availability. Each of the clock input sources must be provided from a different physical HW and 

--- Document Chunk 2259 ---
all these input sources may not be influenced in systematic way. 

--- Document Chunk 2260 ---
This information can be provided in the required reliable way by a dedicated software component

6.7.1.6 Summary 

--- Document Chunk 2298 ---
The detailed solution for such a native running software NHA depends on  

--- Document Chunk 2299 ---
a) the concrete solution of the VE as e.g. host OS and developer interface of the VE 

--- Document Chunk 2300 ---
b) the required hardware information depending on the safety concept of a SE solution 

--- Document Chunk 2301 ---
c) the provided data of the concrete hardware via the interface I2. 

--- Document Chunk 2302 ---
Since NHA functionality depends on the concrete needs of the SEs, it is challenging to standardise 

--- Document Chunk 2303 ---
it. Further study is necessary to enable support for diverse SE solutions while not creating limitations 

--- Document Chunk 2304 ---
on COTS hardware selection.

--- Document Chunk 2310 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2311 ---
Different SE solutions with different safety concepts provide different SRACs in context of the 

--- Document Chunk 2312 ---
required HW related data. For a generic usage of the same COTS hardware for all SE solutions the 

--- Document Chunk 2313 ---
COTS hardware has to provide all required data via interface I2 to NHA. 

--- Document Chunk 2314 ---
The grade of HW independenc e of such a NHA functionality depends on the SE solution specific 

--- Document Chunk 2315 ---
details of the required information at the interface I2, meaning the HW related SRACS of the SE 

--- Document Chunk 2316 ---
solution. 

--- Document Chunk 2317 ---
In the context of HW related SRACSs we have to differentiate between: 

--- Document Chunk 2318 ---
1) basic hardware information: 

--- Document Chunk 2319 ---
- CPU HW identification (e.g. by MAC address, TPM content) 

--- Document Chunk 2320 ---
- steady system clock 

--- Document Chunk 2321 ---
2) specific hardware information which depends on concrete HW details like specific sensors or 

--- Document Chunk 2322 ---
cores, e.g.: 

--- Document Chunk 2323 ---
- core pinning 

--- Document Chunk 2324 ---
- CPU and/or other temperatures 

--- Document Chunk 2325 ---
- voltages 

--- Document Chunk 2326 ---
For basic hardware data 1) the access by NHA will be possible without dependency to the concrete 

--- Document Chunk 2327 ---
interface of the hardware. NHA gets the basic hardware data via OS functionalities of the Host OS 

--- Document Chunk 2328 ---
of the VE. For this basic hardware data a change of the hardware should not have an impact onto 

--- Document Chunk 2329 ---
NHA, SRAC fulfilment by NHA should be possible in a generic way. 

--- Document Chunk 2330 ---
For specific hardware data 2) the access by NHA must probably be adapted specifically for different 

--- Document Chunk 2331 ---
HW variants. In case access to physical hardware details as sensors is not the same for different 

--- Document Chunk 2332 ---
hardware variants, this would mean: a change of the hardware may have an impact onto NHA and 

--- Document Chunk 2333 ---
the SRAC fulfilment by NHA has to be re-validated for the new hardware variant and new version of 

--- Document Chunk 2334 ---
NHA. Anyhow, standardised access to sensors should be strived for where feasible to avoi d such 

--- Document Chunk 2335 ---
re-validation efforts. 

--- Document Chunk 2336 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2337 ---
Open point: It must be clarified, if the required information from the physical hardware can 

--- Document Chunk 2338 ---
be provided via standardized interface I2 or if the NHA functionality must be 

--- Document Chunk 2339 ---
adapted for different HW variants. See Open-008. 

--- Document Chunk 2340 ---
Open point: the responsibility and technical handling (installation  and update) of such a 

--- Document Chunk 2341 ---
NHA software must be clarified. See Open-009. 

--- Document Chunk 2342 ---
6.7.2 Safe handling of Software 

--- Document Chunk 2343 ---
Handling of safety related software by basic integrity management software running on non-safe 

--- Document Chunk 2344 ---
operating systems and VE leads to the hazard that handling of the software (starting and stopping, 

--- Document Chunk 2345 ---
storing and deleting) is not reliable from view of safety.  

--- Document Chunk 2346 ---
Example: 

--- Document Chunk 2347 ---
It cannot be guaranteed in context of SW update of safety related SW that all old SW components 

--- Document Chunk 2348 ---
are stopped and deleted and new ly installed SW components are starte d. Inconsistencies due to 

--- Document Chunk 2349 ---
mixture of old and new versions of the safety related SW components must be identified by the SE.

--- Document Chunk 2355 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2356 ---
Hence the SE has to ensure the consistency of all involved safety related SW components for the 

--- Document Chunk 2357 ---
concrete overall version of the FS, see REQ-HLPI-12. 

--- Document Chunk 2358 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2359 ---
Open point: the safe handling of safety critical software in context of a non-safe VE with 

--- Document Chunk 2360 ---

--- Document Chunk 2361 ---
installation and starting of FS duplicates, see Open-010.

6.8 SECURITY 

--- Document Chunk 2363 ---

--- Document Chunk 2364 ---

--- Document Chunk 2365 ---

6.8.3 ERJU Security in own VCE as “Soft Crypto Box” 

--- Document Chunk 2403 ---
IT-security functionalities are realized as own software running as own compartment in an own virtual 

--- Document Chunk 2404 ---
machine with message-based communication interface I4 to the FS compartments. It’s a kind of “soft 

--- Document Chunk 2405 ---
crypto box”. 

--- Document Chunk 2406 ---
Workload for IT-security is isolated by separated virtual machines (no cross-dependencies between 

--- Document Chunk 2407 ---
compartments of different FS).  FS compartments  are not directly affected by IT security, but 

--- Document Chunk 2408 ---
integration of I4 is necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 2409 ---
Internal communication between the compartments is not secured. This communication between the 

--- Document Chunk 2410 ---
virtual machines goes via the hypervisor and it cannot be ensured that this is protected in needed 

--- Document Chunk 2411 ---
way. Additional latency times are introduced  by message -based communication between the 

--- Document Chunk 2412 ---
functional compartment and the soft crypto box. Re-deploying is complicated because security zones 

--- Document Chunk 2413 ---
have to be reconsidered. This would be hard to maintain, not exploiting flexibility of VCEs.

6.8.4 Conclusion 

--- Document Chunk 2423 ---
From view of “best possible resource isolation ” the ERJU defined IT security functionalities should 

--- Document Chunk 2424 ---
be implemented for each FS compartment individually. From view of “responsibility for SL3 

--- Document Chunk 2425 ---
certification” each FS should be by itself responsible for  IT security of own FS . This means that IT 

--- Document Chunk 2426 ---
security has to he provided as part of the FS compartment. 

--- Document Chunk 2427 ---
Preferred solution is architecture with IT security provided by the FS compartments as described in 

--- Document Chunk 2428 ---
chapter 6.8.1. 

--- Document Chunk 2429 ---
6.9 AVAILABILITY OF FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS 

--- Document Chunk 2430 ---
6.9.1 FS Runtime behavior, reaction time and inter-communication 

--- Document Chunk 2431 ---
The b asis for high availability of a safety related FS is a nearly perfect deterministic runtime 

--- Document Chunk 2432 ---
behaviour, reaction time of the involved FS compartments with high-speed communication  in-

--- Document Chunk 2433 ---
between.  

--- Document Chunk 2434 ---
The SE replicas of an up to SIL4 FS, which are running in different FS compartments on different 

--- Document Chunk 2435 ---
(physical) computing elements, process a time-critical inter-synchronization between the SE replicas 

--- Document Chunk 2436 ---
as e.g. for processing of a safe voting mechanism.  

--- Document Chunk 2437 ---
If an individual process step is not perfect (runtime behaviour, reaction time, inter -communication) 

--- Document Chunk 2438 ---
the SE identifies this and reacts in a safe way as e.g. by stopping the affected SW parts. This leads 

--- Document Chunk 2439 ---
to reduced FS availability and could potentially result in the stoppage of all application replicas of the 

--- Document Chunk 2440 ---
FS. 

--- Document Chunk 2441 ---
The VE shall guarantee a stable runtime behaviour and reaction time of all SW parts within a safety 

--- Document Chunk 2442 ---
critical FS Compartment for each timepoint, see REQ-HLPI-14. 

--- Document Chunk 2443 ---
6.9.2 Individual failures in hardware or software of the platform 

--- Document Chunk 2444 ---
Failures in the hardware or software of the VE lead to failures within the FS compartment(s). To 

--- Document Chunk 2445 ---
address these failures effectively, redundancy mechanisms for the FS compartments are necessary.  

--- Document Chunk 2446 ---
In case of an up to  SIL4 FS this redundancy is realized within the SE and depends on the safety 

--- Document Chunk 2447 ---
principle (as e.g. 2oo3 or 2x2oo2).  

--- Document Chunk 2448 ---
In case of BIL FS , the backup functionalities of VE standard IT solutions may be usable as 

--- Document Chunk 2449 ---
redundancy mechanism. It depends on detail of the concrete FS if such standard solutions can be 

--- Document Chunk 2450 ---
used or not. 

--- Document Chunk 2451 ---
Requirement addressed to the SE of an up to SIL4 FS: The SE shall support the automated repair 

--- Document Chunk 2452 ---
of a failed FS compartment, see REQ-HLPI-15. 

--- Document Chunk 2453 ---
6.9.3 Individual failures in communication 

--- Document Chunk 2454 ---
For availability of external communication to connected systems, each FS uses at least 2 redundant 

--- Document Chunk 2455 ---
communication channels.  Basically, each individual FS compartment can provide individual 

--- Document Chunk 2456 ---
communication channels of a redundant communication . For flexible usage on the side of the FS 

--- Document Chunk 2457 ---
compartment for automated repair of broken network communication channels its necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 2458 ---
consider all FS compartments in the configuration and physical installation of the network.

--- Document Chunk 2465 ---
The VE shall support the mapping of FS compartments to virtualized Ethernet adapters and to tie a 

--- Document Chunk 2466 ---
virtualized Ethernet adapter to a specific physical ethernet card. See REQ-HLPI-16. 

--- Document Chunk 2467 ---
6.9.4 Availability in context of SW maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 2468 ---
SW maintenance of non-safe software as e.g. for IT security patching shall be possible during the 

--- Document Chunk 2469 ---
operational phase of the FS for trackside use cases. 

--- Document Chunk 2470 ---
Example: 

--- Document Chunk 2471 ---
For an up to SIL4 FS with 2oo3 principle, the process for an IT security patch shall look like this: 

--- Document Chunk 2472 ---
• Update of the FS compartment 1 with new version for IT-security mechanism. For this the FS 

--- Document Chunk 2473 ---
keeps running as 2oo2 (FS compartment 2 and 3) during the update phase and achieves 

--- Document Chunk 2474 ---
2oo3 mode again after synchronization of the updated FS compartment 1 with the other FS 

--- Document Chunk 2475 ---
compartments 2 and 3. 

--- Document Chunk 2476 ---
• Repeat this for FS compartment 2. 

--- Document Chunk 2477 ---
• Repeat this for FS compartment 3. 

--- Document Chunk 2478 ---
Requirement addressed to the FS: update of the IT security components within the FS compartments 

--- Document Chunk 2479 ---
shall be possible “VCE-wise one after the other”, see REQ-HLPI-18. 

--- Document Chunk 2480 ---
Update of the VE shall be possible in same way “PCE-wise one after the other”, see REQ-HLPI-19. 

--- Document Chunk 2481 ---
Requirement addressed to the Platform Management: The dependency to update “one after the 

--- Document Chunk 2482 ---
other” must be considered, see REQ-HLPI-20. 

--- Document Chunk 2483 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2484 ---
Open point: The architecture for updating FS by Shared Services and Platform 

--- Document Chunk 2485 ---
Management has to be clarified. See Open-014. 

--- Document Chunk 2486 ---
6.9.5 Geographical redundancy 

--- Document Chunk 2487 ---
For trackside use case s of the Modular Platform, the aspect of “ high grade of centralization” leads 

--- Document Chunk 2488 ---
to increased availability requirements, such as geographical redundancy. 

--- Document Chunk 2489 ---
Geographical redundancy means that the FS is running distributed in different geographical locations 

--- Document Chunk 2490 ---
to provide best possible availability in case of a disaster scenario (as e.g. blackout, terror attack, ...). 

--- Document Chunk 2491 ---
The main challenge in context of geographical redundancy is the handling of the split-brain problem 

--- Document Chunk 2492 ---
for an up to SIL4 FS. See CAP theorem - Wikipedia: 

--- Document Chunk 2493 ---
When a network partition failure happens, it must be decided whether to do one of the following: 

--- Document Chunk 2494 ---
• cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency 

--- Document Chunk 2495 ---
• proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency. Note this 

--- Document Chunk 2496 ---
doesn't necessarily mean that system is highly available to its users. 

--- Document Chunk 2497 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2498 ---
For up to SIL4 FS the consistency must be ensured, and this means that a network partition failure 

--- Document Chunk 2499 ---
must be handled in a safe way . Additionally, the safe communication to connected systems as 

--- Document Chunk 2500 ---
decentralized object controllers must be considered. Safety pro tocols as RaSTA require fully 

--- Document Chunk 2501 ---
synchronized communication channels, which means the switch-over of a centralized  interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 2502 ---

--- Document Chunk 2507 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2508 ---
logic from one location to another geographical location is not possible without interruption of the 

--- Document Chunk 2509 ---
safe communication to object controllers. 

--- Document Chunk 2510 ---
The safety related handling of split-brain topic must be solved on the functional level of the SE in the 

--- Document Chunk 2511 ---
FS, even as e.g. for safety principle 2x2oo2 without geographical distribution. The VE does not know 

--- Document Chunk 2512 ---
details about redundancy mechanism and handling of geographical redundancy by the up to SIL4 

--- Document Chunk 2513 ---
FS. 

--- Document Chunk 2514 ---
Open point: the safety related architecture for georedundant FS with safe handling of split-

--- Document Chunk 2515 ---
brain problem is not yet defined, see Open-015. 

--- Document Chunk 2516 ---
6.10 SCALABILITY 

--- Document Chunk 2517 ---
The modular platform architecture shall allow to increase the number of FS Compartments running 

--- Document Chunk 2518 ---
on the VE as long as the necessary physical HW resources are available. 

--- Document Chunk 2519 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2520 ---
Open point: how to handle the scalable usage of CPU resources of the physical hardware 

--- Document Chunk 2521 ---
(cores, memory, network cards ) for flexible usage by independent FS 

--- Document Chunk 2522 ---
compartments running on same PCE. See Open-016. 

--- Document Chunk 2523 ---
6.11 DIAGNOSIS 

--- Document Chunk 2524 ---
Each diagnosis data must be provided via the interface I1 Diagnosis  to the Shared Services 

--- Document Chunk 2525 ---
Diagnosis as central data sink. In this it will be necessary to transform the data within the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 2526 ---
Management into I1 compatible format, see REQ-HLPI-21. 

--- Document Chunk 2527 ---
Maintenance activities to repair failures shall be automated as good as possible by the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 2528 ---
Management. For this it’s necessary to provide relevant diagnostic data to the Platform Management 

--- Document Chunk 2529 ---
for root cause analysis and automated initiation of maintenance activities, see REQ-HLPI-22. 

--- Document Chunk 2530 ---
Relevant diagnostic data for the Platform Management is, without this list being exhaustive: 

--- Document Chunk 2531 ---
• state of the VE instance on the PCE 

--- Document Chunk 2532 ---
• state of each individual VCE 

--- Document Chunk 2533 ---
• state of the FS regarding availability of the individual FS compartments 

--- Document Chunk 2534 ---
• state of the network which is used for FS internal communication between FS compartments 

--- Document Chunk 2535 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2536 ---
Open point: The details of the diagnosis architecture to process a root cause analysis and 

--- Document Chunk 2537 ---
realize automated repairs are not yet clarified. See Open-017. 

--- Document Chunk 2538 ---
6.11.1 Diagnosis of the Functional Application (FA) 

--- Document Chunk 2539 ---
Diagnosis of the FA is related to logical states within the running application . This diagnosis data is 

--- Document Chunk 2540 ---
provided by the FA itself and provided from the FS compartment via the interface I1 to the Shared 

--- Document Chunk 2541 ---
Service Diagnosis.  This diagnosis data does not have a ny relevance for the VE or the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 2542 ---
Management.

--- Document Chunk 2548 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2549 ---
6.11.2 Diagnosis of the FS 

--- Document Chunk 2550 ---
Each FS is responsible to provide diagnosis dat a about its own health state (e.g., about the health 

--- Document Chunk 2551 ---
state of running SE replicas, FA replicas, …). The FS diagnosis data must be provided by the FS via 

--- Document Chunk 2552 ---
I1 Diagnosis (as defined by TCCS) to the Shared Services as central data sink, see REQ-HLPI-23. 

--- Document Chunk 2553 ---
Additionally, the diagnosis data must be provided to the Platform Managemen t as data sink for the 

--- Document Chunk 2554 ---
handling of FS compartments, see REQ-HLPI-24. 

--- Document Chunk 2555 ---
A FS which is running in several parallel FS compartments  provides diagnosis data  by each FS 

--- Document Chunk 2556 ---
compartment individually. This is based on redundancy principle for availabilit y and additionally by 

--- Document Chunk 2557 ---
individual diagnosis states in the individual FS compartments. It may happen that individual failures 

--- Document Chunk 2558 ---
happen within individual compartments , as e.g. one FS compartment may have a n individual SW 

--- Document Chunk 2559 ---
failure inside. 

--- Document Chunk 2560 ---
The Platform Management must handle this relationship of the individual FS compartments of the 

--- Document Chunk 2561 ---
FS, meaning that one FS provides diagnosis data of several FS compartments, see REQ-ALPI-025. 

--- Document Chunk 2562 ---
6.11.3 Diagnosis of the VE 

--- Document Chunk 2563 ---
Dedicated diagnosis about the VE and virtual computing elements must be provided from the VE to 

--- Document Chunk 2564 ---
the Platform Management, see REQ-HLPI-26. 

--- Document Chunk 2565 ---
The Platform Management must forward this diagnosis data about the VE and VCEs via I1 

--- Document Chunk 2566 ---
Diagnosis to the Shared Services for diagnosis, see REQ-HLPI-27. 

--- Document Chunk 2567 ---
6.11.4 Diagnosis of the COTS Hardware 

--- Document Chunk 2568 ---
Diagnosis about the physical computing elements should be provided by a dedicated diagnosis 

--- Document Chunk 2569 ---
software possibly provided as 3rd party software (as e.g. Prometheus (software) - Wikipedia,  SevOne 

--- Document Chunk 2570 ---
- Wikipedia) running within its own compartment independent from the rail FS, see REQ-HLPI-28.  

--- Document Chunk 2571 ---
This diagnosis data shall be provided to the Platform Management, see REQ-HLPI-29.  

--- Document Chunk 2572 ---
The Platform Management must forward this diagnosis data about the PCE via I1 Diagnosis to the 

--- Document Chunk 2573 ---
Shared Services for diagnosis, see REQ-HLPI-30. 

--- Document Chunk 2574 ---
6.11.5 Diagnosis of the Network 

--- Document Chunk 2575 ---
Due to FS architectures with FS compartments running in parallel on different VCEs with a message-

--- Document Chunk 2576 ---
based communication in between, the topic of network diagnosis is relevant for the FS state. 

--- Document Chunk 2577 ---
The network diagnosis shall provide the diagnosis data to the  Platform Management, see  REQ-

--- Document Chunk 2578 ---
HLPI-31. The Platform Management must evaluate this data in context of “root cause analysis” for 

--- Document Chunk 2579 ---
the related FS, see REQ-HLPI-32. 

--- Document Chunk 2580 ---

6.12 MAINTENANCE  

--- Document Chunk 2588 ---
6.12.1 System Maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 2589 ---
A modular handling of non-safe parts during runtime is necessary  to enable the maintenance of 

--- Document Chunk 2590 ---
systems if they are supposed to stay in operation with high availability requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 2591 ---
Relevant maintenance scenarios during FS runtime are for instance: 

--- Document Chunk 2592 ---
• IT-Security patch in FS  

--- Document Chunk 2593 ---
FS compartment-wise “one-after-the-other”, see REQ-HLPI-33 

--- Document Chunk 2594 ---
• IT-Security patch in VE  

--- Document Chunk 2595 ---
hardware-wise “one-after-the-other”, see REQ-HLPI-34. 

--- Document Chunk 2596 ---
• HW replacement 

--- Document Chunk 2597 ---
of an individual physical computing element during runtime of the FS, see REQ-HLPI-35  

--- Document Chunk 2598 ---
Maintenance activities for safety related software parts are not easily possible during runtime of 

--- Document Chunk 2599 ---
the up to SIL4 FS due to safety related dependencies between the parallel running safety related 

--- Document Chunk 2600 ---
replicas.  

--- Document Chunk 2601 ---
It’s state -of-the-art for safety approval s that the safety related software within the individual 

--- Document Chunk 2602 ---
compartments of a n up to  SIL4 FS belong to the same version. By this an exchange of individual 

--- Document Chunk 2603 ---
safety related SW must be done in all involved compartments and this means a FS stop in between 

--- Document Chunk 2604 ---
= stop of running safety related software (with old version) and start of new safety related software 

--- Document Chunk 2605 ---
(with new version). 

--- Document Chunk 2606 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2607 ---
Open point: architecture and process for installation of SW on new hardware,  

--- Document Chunk 2608 ---
see Open-020. 

--- Document Chunk 2609 ---
6.13 AUTOMATED REPAIRS 

--- Document Chunk 2610 ---
Maintenance activities for the repair of failures shall be automated as much as possible by the 

--- Document Chunk 2611 ---
Platform Management. 

--- Document Chunk 2612 ---
Example: Automated repair of a failed VCE (used by an up to SIL4 FS with 2oo3 principle) 

--- Document Chunk 2613 ---
In case of a failure of an individual VCE this failure is  

--- Document Chunk 2614 ---
• directly identified by the VE, VE provides diagnosis data to the Platform Management. 

--- Document Chunk 2615 ---
• indirectly identified by the SE of the belonging FS, the FS running mode is reduced from 2oo3 

--- Document Chunk 2616 ---
to 2oo2  (because one FS compartment has failed).  FS provides diagnosis data to the 

--- Document Chunk 2617 ---
Platform Management. 

--- Document Chunk 2618 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2619 ---
The Platform Management must process this diagnosis data to 

--- Document Chunk 2620 ---
• identify the failed VCE as root cause 

--- Document Chunk 2621 ---
• initiate the repair (new start) of the VCE automatically 

--- Document Chunk 2622 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2623 ---

--- Document Chunk 2627 ---
FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 77 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 2628 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2629 ---
If such a repair (new start) of the VCE is not successful, the belonging FS compartment must be 

--- Document Chunk 2630 ---
installed in a newly created VCE.  The newly created VCE may be on the same PCE or on another 

--- Document Chunk 2631 ---
PCE. 

--- Document Chunk 2632 ---
In case of VCE creation on another PCE the aspect „FS compartments of an up to SIL4 FS must not 

--- Document Chunk 2633 ---
be installed on same PCE“ must be considered from view availability to avoid a safe reaction by the 

--- Document Chunk 2634 ---
SE which identifies an unallowed SW installation of FS compartments on same hardware. 

--- Document Chunk 2635 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2636 ---
Open point: such an automated installation of safety critical FS compartments by a basic 

--- Document Chunk 2637 ---
integrity Platform Management must be evaluated from view of safety.  See 

--- Document Chunk 2638 ---
Open-021. 

--- Document Chunk 2639 ---
6.13.1 Lifecycle management for the VE 

--- Document Chunk 2640 ---
By usage of existing standard IT solutions as VE , a lifecycle management for the usage in context 

--- Document Chunk 2641 ---
of rails systems is necessary. Each new version of the VE must be qualified for usage in context of 

--- Document Chunk 2642 ---
rail systems. 

--- Document Chunk 2643 ---
Open point: What exactly is necessary in context hardening of the VE? What kind of VE 

--- Document Chunk 2644 ---
functionalities must be deactivated or even removed to ensure that the 

--- Document Chunk 2645 ---
handling of rail systems running on VE is possible in way as needed (efficient 

--- Document Chunk 2646 ---
handling and available running FS)?, see Open-022. 

--- Document Chunk 2647 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2648 ---
The VE shall provide backwards compatibility of the VE configuration interface for FS configuration. 

--- Document Chunk 2649 ---
FS related VE configuration of old version of VE shall not be affected in context of FS migration onto 

--- Document Chunk 2650 ---
new version of the VE. See REQ-HLPI-17. 

--- Document Chunk 2651 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2652 ---
Open point: Is a kind of “generic” testing possible for performance and runtime behaviour 

--- Document Chunk 2653 ---
of a new VE version to avoid the need for integration of each individual FS 

--- Document Chunk 2654 ---
compartment version with a new VE Version? See Open-023. 

--- Document Chunk 2655 ---
A new version of VE shall not have an impact on safety but may have an impact on availability. 

--- Document Chunk 2656 ---
6.13.2 Spare handling of COTS Hardware 

--- Document Chunk 2657 ---
For the usage of COTS hardware spares it has to be considered that  HW providers usually do not 

--- Document Chunk 2658 ---
guarantee that newly ordered hardware is 100% identical to previous deliveries of the same type.  

--- Document Chunk 2659 ---
The detailed HW related dependencies between the COTS hardware and the VE at the interface I2 

--- Document Chunk 2660 ---
must be identified and “managed” in context of maintenance, for this see chapter 6.6. 

--- Document Chunk 2661 ---
6.14 PUBLIC CLOUD 

--- Document Chunk 2662 ---
With “public cloud ” we mean computing services offered by third -party providers over the public 

--- Document Chunk 2663 ---
Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Computing services are 

--- Document Chunk 2664 ---
sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth

--- Document Chunk 2670 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2671 ---
they consume. The cloud provider is responsible for the management and maintenance of the 

--- Document Chunk 2672 ---
services. Access is done via the public internet. 

--- Document Chunk 2673 ---
Examples: 

--- Document Chunk 2674 ---
• Amazon Web Services (AWS) 

--- Document Chunk 2675 ---
• Google Compute Engine (GCE) 

--- Document Chunk 2676 ---
• IBM Cloud 

--- Document Chunk 2677 ---
• Microsoft Azure 

--- Document Chunk 2678 ---
We do not see “public cloud” as a realistic use -case for the moment and within the next 5 years  for 

--- Document Chunk 2679 ---
safety-related applications. A Data Center (“Private Cloud”) with defined overall responsibility will be 

--- Document Chunk 2680 ---
possible. Basic challenges for “public cloud” are described in the following chapters. 

--- Document Chunk 2681 ---
6.14.1 Safety architecture 

--- Document Chunk 2682 ---
Basically, FS compartments of rails systems could technically run in a public clou d. Even safety 

--- Document Chunk 2683 ---
critical FS Compartments could run in a public cloud under the condition that the needed information 

--- Document Chunk 2684 ---
about the physical hardware can be provided in needed reliable way, see chapter 6.8. 

--- Document Chunk 2685 ---
For the FS compartments itself it should not make a difference if the virtual machine  is in a private 

--- Document Chunk 2686 ---
cloud or public cloud. Even protocol drivers for safety relevant communication protocols as RaSTA 

--- Document Chunk 2687 ---
can run in a public cloud due to the safety architecture “underlying VE is not safety relevant”. 

--- Document Chunk 2688 ---
The topic of “native hardware access” (NHA) is not solved for public cloud. 

--- Document Chunk 2689 ---
6.14.2 Security architecture 

--- Document Chunk 2690 ---
Handling of public cloud as a secure device in context of rail infrastructure is not solved. 

--- Document Chunk 2691 ---
Public cloud providers typically do not allow to install own IT security solutions. 

--- Document Chunk 2692 ---
6.14.3 Performance, reaction time and availability 

--- Document Chunk 2693 ---
The fulfilment of requirements of especially safety -relevant FS compartments to the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 2694 ---
software from view of performance, reaction time and reliability in the runtime behaviour for each 

--- Document Chunk 2695 ---
timepoint over long periods of several years is not ye t experienced in the context of public clouds.  

--- Document Chunk 2696 ---
Such requirements (performance, reaction time) do not affect the safety but the availability of the 

--- Document Chunk 2697 ---
FS. 

--- Document Chunk 2698 ---
Example: 

--- Document Chunk 2699 ---
If a SW component does not wake up and react in the required time -range of 20 -50ms this 

--- Document Chunk 2700 ---
misbehaviour would be identified by the SE and would lead to safe reactions and perhaps to a stop 

--- Document Chunk 2701 ---
of the safety critical FS compartment(s).  

--- Document Chunk 2702 ---
6.14.4 Integration and maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 2703 ---
Public cloud providers are not able to integrate rail systems with an updated version of the public 

--- Document Chunk 2704 ---
cloud. Handling of changes in the public cloud in context of integration with the rail systems is not 

--- Document Chunk 2705 ---
solved.

--- Document Chunk 2711 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2712 ---
6.14.5 Business Case 

--- Document Chunk 2713 ---
Comparison of costs for running rail systems over decades within a public cloud with costs for private 

--- Document Chunk 2714 ---
cloud has not been done. 

--- Document Chunk 2715 ---
6.14.6 Responsibility 

--- Document Chunk 2716 ---
How to handle the situation that changes or instabilities of the public cloud lead to reactions on side 

--- Document Chunk 2717 ---
of the rail systems and in consequence to impact onto the rail operation (e.g. as stopping of trains 

--- Document Chunk 2718 ---
due to safe reaction of failed FS compartments)? 

--- Document Chunk 2719 ---
6.15 CERTIFICATION 

--- Document Chunk 2720 ---
In context of certification the main goal is to define the safety - and security -architecture of the 

--- Document Chunk 2721 ---
different layers within the computing platform in such a way that changes in non-safe parts like the 

--- Document Chunk 2722 ---
COTS based hardware or in common SW layers like the virtualization can be handled without impact 

--- Document Chunk 2723 ---
onto safety- and security-certification of the Functional Systems running above. This is in the scope 

--- Document Chunk 2724 ---
of the SP PRAMS domain that is currently working on a document “Evolution Management of safety 

--- Document Chunk 2725 ---
related systems” [17]. Further findings and recommendations from study on modular certification and 

--- Document Chunk 2726 ---
homologation can as well be expected in the upcoming R2DATO Deliverable D26.4 [20]. 

--- Document Chunk 2727 ---
6.16 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 

--- Document Chunk 2728 ---
The situation “various Functional Systems running aggregated on same computing element” has a 

--- Document Chunk 2729 ---
lot of new challenges affecting the architecture, interfaces and processes which have not been 

--- Document Chunk 2730 ---
addressed so far by standardi sation as , e.g., EULYNX, which is up to now focused only on the 

--- Document Chunk 2731 ---
trackside object controller. 

--- Document Chunk 2732 ---
The basic results of our investigations show that essential architecture aspects depend on the 

--- Document Chunk 2733 ---
specific solutions for SE and VE: 

--- Document Chunk 2734 ---
1) The grade of HW independence is SE solution specific and depends on the safety concept of 

--- Document Chunk 2735 ---
the SE. Different HW related SRACs of different SE solutions require different NHA variants with 

--- Document Chunk 2736 ---
even specific direct dependencies to the interface I2 to the physical hardware and interface I3 

--- Document Chunk 2737 ---
extension to the SE running above I3. 

--- Document Chunk 2738 ---
A generic HW independent solution of NHA is not possible for different SE solutions due to SE 

--- Document Chunk 2739 ---
solution specific dependencies at the interfaces I2 and I3 extension. 

--- Document Chunk 2740 ---
2) The rules for handling of FS compartments in context of installation and update on side of the 

--- Document Chunk 2741 ---
Platform Management depend on the specific SE solution (as e.g. 2oo3, 2x2oo2, ..). 

--- Document Chunk 2742 ---
3) The detailed solution for the SW orchestration on side of the Platform Management depends on 

--- Document Chunk 2743 ---
the specific VE solution. 

--- Document Chunk 2744 ---
4) The technical SW architecture for realization of NHA depends on the specific VE solution and 

--- Document Chunk 2745 ---
belonging Host OS. 

--- Document Chunk 2746 ---
5) The details for clarification of the overall architecture for IT-security according to IEC 62443 

--- Document Chunk 2747 ---
depend on the specific VE solution.

Summary: 

--- Document Chunk 2757 ---
The depicted architecture and principles of interfaces I2 and I3 are generally independent of the 

--- Document Chunk 2758 ---
specific virtualization environment and specific hardware and safety layer implementations (as long 

--- Document Chunk 2759 ---
as certain requirements are met as detailed in Section HLPI Requirements). However, specific safety 

--- Document Chunk 2760 ---
layer realizations may impose specific requirements on the NHA . Hence there will possibly not be 

--- Document Chunk 2761 ---
one single NHA realization . Further studies are needed to explore how the NHA requirements for 

--- Document Chunk 2762 ---
different safety solutions can be harmonized or potentially omitted altogether. 

--- Document Chunk 2763 ---
If several different SE solutions shall run on the same VE solution , it’s necessary to handle the SE 

--- Document Chunk 2764 ---
solution specific aspects in context of “HW related SRACS to fulfill by specific NHA functionality” and 

--- Document Chunk 2765 ---
HW dependency individually for each SE solution. 

--- Document Chunk 2766 ---
The figure below show s the specifics in the architecture according to interfaces I2, I3 and to the 

--- Document Chunk 2767 ---
Platform Management. 

--- Document Chunk 2768 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2769 ---
Figure 38: Specifics in architecture 

--- Document Chunk 2770 ---
Even if the interfaces I2 and I3 depend in detail on specifics of the SE solution it’s necessary and 

--- Document Chunk 2771 ---
possible to define the functional overall architecture for the Shared Services, Platform Management 

--- Document Chunk 2772 ---
and Functional Systems. 

--- Document Chunk 2773 ---
And the topic of “best quality in resource isolation ” needs practical investigation to identify feasible

7 APPLICATION-LEVEL PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE (ALPI) 

--- Document Chunk 2782 ---
7.1 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 2783 ---
The main objective of the ALPI Interface, used in the MPC modular platform, is to simplify the design 

--- Document Chunk 2784 ---
of a generic "functional application" that realizes a Business Logic in the railway sector. 

--- Document Chunk 2785 ---
The purpose of the interface is to allow application engineers to focus on solving problems closely 

--- Document Chunk 2786 ---
related to Railway Functional Applications, delegating part of the solutions to problems concerning 

--- Document Chunk 2787 ---
safety, security, HW/SW integration, deployment , and maintenance to the underlying layers of the 

--- Document Chunk 2788 ---
MPC architecture. The interface also aims to allow the use of standard COTS solutions as much as 

--- Document Chunk 2789 ---
possible, to facilitate development of Business Logic by different suppliers. 

--- Document Chunk 2790 ---
The proposed ALPI interface shall m inimize the impact on the development of runtime services , 

--- Document Chunk 2791 ---
providing the characterization of the services through configuration values (see REQ-ALPI-016), that 

--- Document Chunk 2792 ---
define the characteristics of safety, security , and management functionalities for functional 

--- Document Chunk 2793 ---
application SW orchestration. This simplifies the interface on the functional application user  side, 

--- Document Chunk 2794 ---
hiding the complexity of the solutions adopted in the MPC architecture to ensure the required levels 

--- Document Chunk 2795 ---
of safety and security (see REQ-ALPI-04). 

--- Document Chunk 2796 ---
The ALPI interface makes it possible to use different MPC platforms from different vendors, enabling 

--- Document Chunk 2797 ---
extensive use of standard IT solutions . reuse of COTS products, adoption of innovative solutions 

--- Document Chunk 2798 ---
provided by the market , especially in relation to developments in the fields of  Operational 

--- Document Chunk 2799 ---
Technologies (OT), I nformation and Communication T echnologies (ICT), Safety and Security 

--- Document Chunk 2800 ---
Management. 

--- Document Chunk 2801 ---
This chapter deals with basic assumptions, preconditions, and cornerstones necessary to build and 

--- Document Chunk 2802 ---
specify an API used by applications with safety relevance from CENELEC Basic Integrity up to SIL4. 

--- Document Chunk 2803 ---
It reflects possibilities and ideas but does not intend to head towards a specific direction, as this shall 

--- Document Chunk 2804 ---
be left to the vendors of the API.  However, the suggest approach is to promote the adoption of a 

--- Document Chunk 2805 ---
common high level API set, providing the same functionalities, eventually with different semantics 

--- Document Chunk 2806 ---
harmonized with the introduction of adapters. 

--- Document Chunk 2807 ---
The discussions presented in this chapter are based on the inputs from the SP CE domain 

--- Document Chunk 2808 ---
(chapter 3.7), the architecture proposal in WP26’s first deliverable [18] and the ongoing work in 

--- Document Chunk 2809 ---
WP26 itself. 

--- Document Chunk 2810 ---
The following description includes aspects related to the "programming interfaces" and related to the 

--- Document Chunk 2811 ---
definitions of needed functionalities from the view of a Functional Application. The descriptions cover 

--- Document Chunk 2812 ---
both runtime services and off-line configuration. 

--- Document Chunk 2813 ---
With reference to safety, the descriptions refer to the I4 interface in the case of Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 2814 ---
with Basic Integrity Level, while they refer to the I5 interface in the case of safety-related functions. 

--- Document Chunk 2815 ---
It is assumed that all I4 services are provided by  the RTE, so I4 coincides with RTE. The Safety 

--- Document Chunk 2816 ---
Related I5 interface contains the restricted subset of I4 services compliant to CENELEC rules and 

--- Document Chunk 2817 ---
additional safety services provided by the Safety Layer, needed to tranparently manage safety 

--- Document Chunk 2818 ---
requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 2819 ---
The ALPI I5 interface cointains the t ransparent safety management of the replicas when needed. 

--- Document Chunk 2820 ---
The off-line configuration allows the proper selection of the safety services. The configuration knows 

--- Document Chunk 2821 ---
the nature of the FA: if it requires safety services or not, OR if it requires I5 or not.

7.2 CORNERSTONES OF ALPI 

--- Document Chunk 2829 ---
To achieve platform independence on application level, the API serving the application must provide 

--- Document Chunk 2830 ---
all necessary safety -related and non -safety-related interfaces and resources for fulfilling the 

--- Document Chunk 2831 ---
application functions including diagnosis, logging, and monitoring. 

--- Document Chunk 2832 ---
Another basic aspect for platform independence is, that certain architectural principles are shared. 

--- Document Chunk 2833 ---
Otherwise, standardisation would be hard, not to say impossible. As a result of this, also the 

--- Document Chunk 2834 ---
behaviour on the other platform interfaces must be specified with respect to the goal since this is a 

--- Document Chunk 2835 ---
necessary pre-requisite for full interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 2836 ---
Furthermore, Platform independence requires a standardised language to specify the application’s 

--- Document Chunk 2837 ---
deployment-configuration in a platform agnostic way. During integration of the application with a 

--- Document Chunk 2838 ---
specific platform, the platform -agnostic application deployme nt-configuration is then 

--- Document Chunk 2839 ---
translated/converted into a corresponding platform specific application deployment-configuration. 

--- Document Chunk 2840 ---
The process related to the deployment and configuration should be managed using a “model driven” 

--- Document Chunk 2841 ---
approach. The model must provide the rules and procedures for the aggregation of the e lementary 

--- Document Chunk 2842 ---
basic elements necessary for the incremental construction of the subsystem layers. For each level, 

--- Document Chunk 2843 ---
the minimum constituent elements, i.e. the “ basic component s” are identified and their use and 

--- Document Chunk 2844 ---
integration is described via data structures. Note that, this translation or conversion is not an easy, 

--- Document Chunk 2845 ---
automatic task as it needs to deal with technical functionality as well as with safety principles and 

--- Document Chunk 2846 ---
fulfilment. Common standard tools must be used during the process to configure components and 

--- Document Chunk 2847 ---
their aggregation. 

--- Document Chunk 2848 ---
7.2.1 Main principles followed for the ALPI’s definition 

--- Document Chunk 2849 ---
The three guidelines that are adopted in this document are listed here:  

--- Document Chunk 2850 ---
• The implementation of Business Logic should be as easy as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 2851 ---
• The implementation of Business Logic should be as standard as possible (see REQ-ALPI-

--- Document Chunk 2852 ---
02). 

--- Document Chunk 2853 ---
• The Business Logic should be easily integrated and reused. 

--- Document Chunk 2854 ---
7.2.1.1 Functional Interface goals 

--- Document Chunk 2855 ---
These goals are achieved through a functional interface that ensures: 

--- Document Chunk 2856 ---
a. Independence: ALPI shall allow developing an application regardless  of the SW/HW of 

--- Document Chunk 2857 ---
the underlying layers (see REQ-ALPI-01) 

--- Document Chunk 2858 ---
b. Transparency: Transparency of the complexities related to safety and security 

--- Document Chunk 2859 ---
architectures/mechanisms (see REQ-ALPI-06) 

--- Document Chunk 2860 ---
c. Compatibility and Portability: ALPI shall allow running the same application on different 

--- Document Chunk 2861 ---
commercial of-the-shelf platforms, using standard HW/SW basic components (see REQ-

--- Document Chunk 2862 ---
ALPI-05) 

--- Document Chunk 2863 ---
d. Flexibility: maximum flexibility shall be allowed in case of Non-Safety Related Functional 

--- Document Chunk 2864 ---
Application to take full advantage of the evolution of ICT and OT technologies . 

--- Document Chunk 2865 ---
Constraints that limit the use of products with new technologies developed in the COTS 

--- Document Chunk 2866 ---
environment should be avoided; however, solutions/products that favour a high level of

FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 83 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 2872 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2873 ---
standardisation in the development of BL should be recommended.  For Safety Related 

--- Document Chunk 2874 ---
Functional Application restrictions are to be considered because of the compliance to 

--- Document Chunk 2875 ---
safety standard (see REQ-ALPI-03). 

--- Document Chunk 2876 ---
7.2.2 Previous Work as discussed in D26.1 

--- Document Chunk 2877 ---
With reference to section 2.3, several pre-existing documents expressing previous thoughts on the 

--- Document Chunk 2878 ---
topic influenced this document, especially these documents:  

--- Document Chunk 2879 ---
• PI-API DB/Thales/Sysgo/Fraunhofer/... [3] 

--- Document Chunk 2880 ---
• PI-API DB/SMO [4] 

--- Document Chunk 2881 ---
• OCORA papers [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]

7.3 STRUCTURE OVERVIEW 

--- Document Chunk 2884 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2885 ---
Figure 39: High Level Process of Application Development 

--- Document Chunk 2886 ---
Chapter 7.3 tackles the endeavour in 3 different stages: 

--- Document Chunk 2887 ---
• “Common Basic Assumption” (see chapter 7.3.1) 

--- Document Chunk 2888 ---
• “Application-Level Platform Components” (see chapter 7.3.2) 

--- Document Chunk 2889 ---
• “Set of Deliverables for the Integrator” (see chapter 7.3.3) 

--- Document Chunk 2890 ---
Chapter 7.4 contains a description of the models to be adopted and the evaluations of the impact on 

--- Document Chunk 2891 ---
the ALPI interface regarding safety, security, maintainability, orchestration.

--- Document Chunk 2900 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2901 ---
This paragraph summarizes basic and agreed assumptions. As a goal, a general direction of the 

--- Document Chunk 2902 ---
result should be imaginable after reading this section. For each assumption an impact evaluation on 

--- Document Chunk 2903 ---
ALPI and on Functional Application is carried out in advance. 

--- Document Chunk 2904 ---
7.3.1.1 Architectural Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 2905 ---
Following an API usually also means to adhere to a certain architecture or, at least, to some basic 

--- Document Chunk 2906 ---
architectural concepts. This paragraph tries to summaries exactly those concepts in a high -level 

--- Document Chunk 2907 ---
description. 

--- Document Chunk 2908 ---
The main goal of ALPI is the standardization of the development of a Business Logic. It is assumed 

--- Document Chunk 2909 ---
that a Business Logic consists in the implementation of one or more Functional Application s based 

--- Document Chunk 2910 ---
on services provided by ALPI. 

--- Document Chunk 2911 ---
1. Each Functional Application consists of one or more “ processes" as defined in the 

--- Document Chunk 2912 ---
glossary.(see 3.7.2 and REQ-ALPI-022, REQ-ALPI-025, REQ-ALPI-026). 

--- Document Chunk 2913 ---
2. The platform can be assessed against relevant standards ( as at least CENELEC EN50126 / 

--- Document Chunk 2914 ---
EN50716 / EN50129 and additional ones as  EN50155 for on -board). These standards 

--- Document Chunk 2915 ---
influence architectural decisions for the modular platform concept. Functional Application and 

--- Document Chunk 2916 ---
ALPI must be compliant to relevant CENELEC standards. (see REQ-ALPI-024) 

--- Document Chunk 2917 ---
3. Redundancy for safety is supported, depending on and controlled via configuration.  ALPI I5 

--- Document Chunk 2918 ---
provides services that allow a Safety Related Functional Application to transparently manage 

--- Document Chunk 2919 ---
redundancy for safety. 

--- Document Chunk 2920 ---
4. Redundancy for availability is supported, depending on and controlled via configuration. ALPI 

--- Document Chunk 2921 ---
I4 provides services that allow a Functional Application to manage redundancy for availability 

--- Document Chunk 2922 ---
5. Communication is message -based. ALPI provides services that enable communication in a 

--- Document Chunk 2923 ---
single, standardized, common way. 

--- Document Chunk 2924 ---
6. Run-To-Completion scheme within a (sub)process.  ALPI provides services  that allow the 

--- Document Chunk 2925 ---
Functional Application to adopt the RTC scheme. (see REQ-ALPI-027) 

--- Document Chunk 2926 ---
7. Replica deterministic behaviour.  Deterministic behaviour of a Functional Application is 

--- Document Chunk 2927 ---
transparently assured inside ALPI services, additional services allow a Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 2928 ---
to do checks. 

--- Document Chunk 2929 ---
8. Clear application lifecycle, minimum : Start/Init → Operate → Stop/Shutdown. ALPI provides 

--- Document Chunk 2930 ---
services that allow the Functiona Application to adopt the lifecycle scheme. 

--- Document Chunk 2931 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2932 ---
7.3.1.2 Platform Components 

--- Document Chunk 2933 ---
Platform components are the basic components, tools and libraries needed to implement, test and 

--- Document Chunk 2934 ---
run applications, such as: 

--- Document Chunk 2935 ---
• Toolchain (e.g. validated compiler, linker, diagnosis, tracing) (see REQ-ALPI-029) 

--- Document Chunk 2936 ---
• System Libraries (e.g. glibc, crypto-libs) 

--- Document Chunk 2937 ---
• Coverage- and Test-Tools

--- Document Chunk 2941 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2942 ---
FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 85 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 2943 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2944 ---
These components are provided by the Run Time Environment and may be specific, depending on 

--- Document Chunk 2945 ---
the RTE. ALPI provides a standard “model driven” description that allows the integration of the 

--- Document Chunk 2946 ---
Functional Application with the needed ingredients in a common standard way. 

--- Document Chunk 2947 ---
7.3.1.3 Platform Services 

--- Document Chunk 2948 ---
The platform services discussed here are to be seen as part of the services provided to an application 

--- Document Chunk 2949 ---
by the “Independence API”. These include but are not limited to: 

--- Document Chunk 2950 ---
• Logging (e.g. syslog) (see REQ-ALPI-019, REQ-ALPI-036) 

--- Document Chunk 2951 ---
• Process control (e.g. create, clone, delete) 

--- Document Chunk 2952 ---
• Memory management (e.g. malloc, free) 

--- Document Chunk 2953 ---
• Timing (e.g. time of day, sleep, different clocks) (see REQ-ALPI-030) 

--- Document Chunk 2954 ---
• Communication (e.g. sockets, message queues) 

--- Document Chunk 2955 ---
• Maintenance-related diagnostics and errorcodes (see REQ-ALPI-038) 

--- Document Chunk 2956 ---
• Security functions (see REQ-ALPI-014) 

--- Document Chunk 2957 ---
• Persitency functions 

--- Document Chunk 2958 ---
Note that parts of these services c ould be safety relevant. For the correct us age of these services 

--- Document Chunk 2959 ---
both in the BIL and SIL cases, ALPI will allow to specify the Safety Integrity Level to be used through 

--- Document Chunk 2960 ---
the configuration, keeping the runtime interfaces as unchanged as possible,. 

--- Document Chunk 2961 ---
Due to the trade-off between the maximum flexibility for non-Safety Related Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 2962 ---
and the constraints imposed by the CENELEC standard, ALPI will provide the Safety Related 

--- Document Chunk 2963 ---
Functional Application with a restricted subset of the available RTE services. 

--- Document Chunk 2964 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2965 ---
7.3.1.4 Functionality Implementation Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 2966 ---
In this section, assumptions are proposed on the functionalities that ALPI must provide for the 

--- Document Chunk 2967 ---
development and implementation of an application. These functionalities must also take into account 

--- Document Chunk 2968 ---
any constraints deriving from the use of the modular platform. 

--- Document Chunk 2969 ---
The assumptions considered concern architecture, life cycle, communications, diagnosis. 

--- Document Chunk 2970 ---
ALPI makes assumptions regarding how A pplications will work and to how they are structured and 

--- Document Chunk 2971 ---
may favor certain implementation concepts that doesn’t relate to MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 2972 ---
For example, the usage of a gateway concept for the implementation of safe protocols and 

--- Document Chunk 2973 ---
specialized data services for diagnostics are handled here. 

--- Document Chunk 2974 ---
Note that these kind s of assumptions and rules need to be well defined within the user 

--- Document Chunk 2975 ---
documentation. 

--- Document Chunk 2976 ---
It is assumed that ALPI will provide a Functional Application with the services based on the following 

--- Document Chunk 2977 ---
functionalities provided by the modular platform: 

--- Document Chunk 2978 ---
• Configuration for runtime behavior with reference to  execution environment, Redundancy 

--- Document Chunk 2979 ---
Safety Integrity Level, Security Integrity Level, Communication. 

--- Document Chunk 2980 ---
• Lifecycle: Start/Operate/Stop phases. (see REQ-ALPI-031)

--- Document Chunk 2986 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 2987 ---
• Non-Safety Related Communication (i.e. OPC/UA or SNMP communication).(see REQ-ALPI-

--- Document Chunk 2988 ---
032) 

--- Document Chunk 2989 ---
• Safety-Related Communication (with different protocol implementations). 

--- Document Chunk 2990 ---
• Logging scheme. 

--- Document Chunk 2991 ---
• Diagnosis. 

--- Document Chunk 2992 ---
7.3.1.5 Platform Behaviour 

--- Document Chunk 2993 ---
The behaviour of the modular platform needs to be well defined within the user documentation. Even 

--- Document Chunk 2994 ---
if the implementation details do not need to be known , basic behaviour and maybe also limitations 

--- Document Chunk 2995 ---
need to be known from the application developer. 

--- Document Chunk 2996 ---
ALPI will provide a Functional Application with services that allow the characterization of the platform 

--- Document Chunk 2997 ---
behaviour in relation to: 

--- Document Chunk 2998 ---
• Replica management 

--- Document Chunk 2999 ---
• Communication synchronization 

--- Document Chunk 3000 ---
• Timing/synchronisation rounds 

--- Document Chunk 3001 ---
• Platform health indication and management data available 

--- Document Chunk 3002 ---
• Logging/diagnosis environment & behaviour 

--- Document Chunk 3003 ---
• External interfaces (see also chapter 8) 

--- Document Chunk 3004 ---
7.3.2 Application-Level Platform Components 

--- Document Chunk 3005 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3006 ---
Figure 41: Application-Level Platform Ingredients Overview 

--- Document Chunk 3007 ---
An application consists of different parts, which are drafted in Figure 41 above.  

--- Document Chunk 3008 ---
The main parts are: 

--- Document Chunk 3009 ---
• Generic Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 3010 ---
• Configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3011 ---
• Certification Artefacts

--- Document Chunk 3018 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3019 ---
Note that this description shall be explanatory only, a real realisation of such a platform can also add 

--- Document Chunk 3020 ---
other parts, if needed. 

--- Document Chunk 3021 ---
7.3.2.1 Generic Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 3022 ---
The Generic Functional Application implements a certain Business Logic (BL) into a piece of 

--- Document Chunk 3023 ---
software, that might be accompanied by SRACs (from RTE)  (see REQ-ALPI-020), if necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 3024 ---
“Generic” refers to the fact, that the goal is to enable development of different applications 

--- Document Chunk 3025 ---
independent of a concrete execution platform (see REQ-ALPI-01). Additionally, the same application 

--- Document Chunk 3026 ---
(at least source code) could also be used on platforms of different vendors if this is beneficia l and 

--- Document Chunk 3027 ---
necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 3028 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3029 ---
Figure 42: Generic Functional Application Overview 

--- Document Chunk 3030 ---
As a general concept, the platform shall allow to run applications with different levels of criticality in 

--- Document Chunk 3031 ---
parallel. This so-called “mixed criticality” approach decouples the lifecycle of applications of different 

--- Document Chunk 3032 ---
SIL levels from each other and shall ease the process of changing, especially for basic integrity 

--- Document Chunk 3033 ---
applications (see REQ-ALPI-013). Of course, this goal can only be reached if the safety solution 

--- Document Chunk 3034 ---
supports it.  

--- Document Chunk 3035 ---
Note: changing of functionality and using same functions on a different RTE without doing anything 

--- Document Chunk 3036 ---
regarding safety assessment is currently not possible and needs further study. 

--- Document Chunk 3037 ---
7.3.2.1.1 Business Logic software – ALPI services 

--- Document Chunk 3038 ---
A Business Logic SW is composed of one or more specific Functional Application SW (FA), located 

--- Document Chunk 3039 ---
and executed in HW independent Functional System Compartments. 

--- Document Chunk 3040 ---
ALPI provides each Functional Application with services to communicate with 

--- Document Chunk 3041 ---
• external entities via a group of interfaces referred to as “I1”. I1 contains the “OI” interface 

--- Document Chunk 3042 ---
that is used to manage (monitor, control, diagnose, configure) the computing environments. 

--- Document Chunk 3043 ---
• other remote/local Functional Systems to manage safe/non-safe functional application data 

--- Document Chunk 3044 ---
necessary to realize an application. This communication-based interface is referred as I0.

Figure 43: Functional Application Interactions 

--- Document Chunk 3054 ---
It is to be noted that ALPI shall standardize the communication interface, providing basic standard 

--- Document Chunk 3055 ---
functions that allow communication with both external entities, local/remote systems using always 

--- Document Chunk 3056 ---
the same common services. The type of the runtime communic ation is selected via a configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3057 ---
specification. 

--- Document Chunk 3058 ---
A Functional Application SW consist of basic components that implement a Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 3059 ---
Task (FAT) (see REQ-ALPI-07). FATs use ALPI’s services for communication. 

--- Document Chunk 3060 ---

--- Document Chunk 3062 ---
ALPI provide each Functional Application Task also with all RTE services necessary for task 

--- Document Chunk 3063 ---
management and transparently interacts with SE in case of Safety Related Functional Application. 

--- Document Chunk 3064 ---
ALPI services are available as Function Call and as Configuration data. 

--- Document Chunk 3065 ---
Depending on the type of the services, they can be classified into categories.

7.3.2.2 Configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3075 ---
Configuration data is consisting of at least two fundamental parts: 

--- Document Chunk 3076 ---
• engineering data: needed for the business logic to work. Often the engineering data itself is 

--- Document Chunk 3077 ---
again partitioned into 

--- Document Chunk 3078 ---
o market/customer specific data 

--- Document Chunk 3079 ---
o into market/customer specific data and product generic data 

--- Document Chunk 3080 ---
• RTE configuration data for software execution (see REQ-ALPI-033). 

--- Document Chunk 3081 ---
For all RTE specific configuration a strong requirement would be, that all platforms from different 

--- Document Chunk 3082 ---
vendors share a common RTE syntax and semantic, so that running the same application on 

--- Document Chunk 3083 ---
different platforms is as easy as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 3084 ---
Examples for engineering data configuration are: 

--- Document Chunk 3085 ---
• Data Base of IXL rules to be used/checked during BL runtime execution 

--- Document Chunk 3086 ---
• Logical endpoints  that identify all (external/internal) entities that are involved in the 

--- Document Chunk 3087 ---
command/control process implemented by a FA 

--- Document Chunk 3088 ---
• safety mechanism (integrity check, version control/congruency) to ensure that the BL and the 

--- Document Chunk 3089 ---
safe system is consistent 

--- Document Chunk 3090 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3091 ---
Examples for RTE specific configuration are: 

--- Document Chunk 3092 ---
• Scheduling, execution budget 

--- Document Chunk 3093 ---
• Communication endpoint configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3094 ---
• Communication protocol details 

--- Document Chunk 3095 ---
• Redundancy configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3096 ---
• Voting algorithms

7.3.2.3 Certification Artefacts 

--- Document Chunk 3107 ---
For a successful certification, a set of artefacts is needed: 

--- Document Chunk 3108 ---
• RTE artefacts 

--- Document Chunk 3109 ---
o RTE SRACs, the Safety Related Application Conditions 

--- Document Chunk 3110 ---
▪ Need to be fulfilled by the application, or “transferred” to the customer  (see REQ-

--- Document Chunk 3111 ---
ALPI-020, REQ-ALPI-021) 

--- Document Chunk 3112 ---
o RTE Security Conditions 

--- Document Chunk 3113 ---
▪ Have to be defined and implemented from the RTE 

--- Document Chunk 3114 ---
▪ But need to be fulfilled by the  application (according to definition) to achieve a 

--- Document Chunk 3115 ---
certain security level assessment 

--- Document Chunk 3116 ---
o RTE certification + Safety case 

--- Document Chunk 3117 ---
▪ On system level, so that it can be treated as “black -box” from the point of view of 

--- Document Chunk 3118 ---
the Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 3119 ---
o RTE rules 

--- Document Chunk 3120 ---
▪ Describes details about what to do and not to do on application level 

--- Document Chunk 3121 ---
• Application artefacts 

--- Document Chunk 3122 ---
o An application specific safety case 

--- Document Chunk 3123 ---
o Proof of application to follow the “RTE rules” 

--- Document Chunk 3124 ---
o Proof of application to follow the SRACS coming with the RTE 

--- Document Chunk 3125 ---
o Proof of application to follow the Security conditions 

--- Document Chunk 3126 ---
7.3.2.4 Platform Independence API - ALPI Interface 

--- Document Chunk 3127 ---
The ALPI interface (Application -level Platform Independence, previously: PI API – Platform 

--- Document Chunk 3128 ---
Independent Application Programming Interface) is the concrete implementation how the Functional 

--- Document Chunk 3129 ---
Application utilizes the underlying platform. It contains syntax and  semantic details for each and 

--- Document Chunk 3130 ---
every purpose needed from the application.  

--- Document Chunk 3131 ---
As outlined in the chapters above, more than only this ALPI is needed to realize the goal of portable 

--- Document Chunk 3132 ---
applications, such as architectural preconditions and concrete platform behaviour. All that kind of 

--- Document Chunk 3133 ---
necessities, including ALPI, need to be described in d etail within the user documentation. For all 

--- Document Chunk 3134 ---
safety relevant parts, additionally so-called SRACs (Safety Related Application Conditions) need to 

--- Document Chunk 3135 ---
be clearly defined and explained.

• SRACs in different contexts, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 3147 ---
o towards the RTE 

--- Document Chunk 3148 ---
o towards the HW 

--- Document Chunk 3149 ---
o towards the application developer 

--- Document Chunk 3150 ---
o Note that it is very likely, that different platform variants come with additional, specific 

--- Document Chunk 3151 ---
SRACS (hopefully, just a few...) 

--- Document Chunk 3152 ---
• Models (see REQ-ALPI-017)

o Maintenance/Diagnosis Model 

--- Document Chunk 3158 ---
• Approaches, Methods and References 

--- Document Chunk 3159 ---
o Testing and Integration Approach 

--- Document Chunk 3160 ---
o Testing Suites, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 3161 ---
▪ generic reference for a modular platform 

--- Document Chunk 3162 ---
▪ ALPI/“PI API” test suite

7.3.3 Set of Deliverables for Integrator 

--- Document Chunk 3179 ---
After the development and testing is finished, a set of deliverables is bundled for the integrator. This 

--- Document Chunk 3180 ---
set is suitable to enable the integrator to enable the application on a modular platform instance. 

--- Document Chunk 3181 ---
• Application 

--- Document Chunk 3182 ---
o Depending on the delivery model, in source-or binary form 

--- Document Chunk 3183 ---

o From RTE vendor and from application vendor 

--- Document Chunk 3188 ---
• Integration of application with modular platform components 

--- Document Chunk 3189 ---
o Depending on the concrete case: RTE, OS, HW, Virtualization, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 3190 ---
o Test specs/cases to perform integration wherever possible

7.4 ALPI DETAILS 

--- Document Chunk 3192 ---
Based on what is reported in the chapter 7.3, this section provides further details about the 

--- Document Chunk 3193 ---
architecture, layers, and models used to describe the ALPI interface. Descriptions are based on the 

--- Document Chunk 3194 ---
inputs from the SP CE domain (chapter 3.7), the architecture proposal in WP26’s deliverable [18], 

--- Document Chunk 3195 ---
[19] and the ongoing work in WP26 itself. 

--- Document Chunk 3196 ---
7.4.1 Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 3197 ---
Application developers should be able to focus on implementing the application logic. All safety and 

--- Document Chunk 3198 ---
fault tolerance mechanisms not inherent to the application's logic – specifically redundancy, voting 

--- Document Chunk 3199 ---
and persistence – shall be implemented in, and transparently handled by the platform. 

--- Document Chunk 3200 ---
The application-level platform independence (ALPI) interface provides the standardised abstraction 

--- Document Chunk 3201 ---
of all platform’s specific hardware and software – allowing for portable applications. 

--- Document Chunk 3202 ---
ALPI should also allow the aggregation and the interaction of Functional Application with different 

--- Document Chunk 3203 ---
Safety Integrity Level into a single Functional System. 

--- Document Chunk 3204 ---
7.4.2 ALPI architecture and layers 

--- Document Chunk 3205 ---
From a functional point of view, ALPI interfaces I4 and I5 are part of RTE and SE respectively. 

--- Document Chunk 3206 ---
ALPI provides the I4 interface in the case of Basic Integrity Level FA. (see REQ-ALPI-011)

FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 93 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 3212 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3213 ---
ALPI provides the I5 interface in the case of Safety Integrity Level FA that require the use of a Safety 

--- Document Chunk 3214 ---
Environment that ensures SIL using composite safety mechanisms. (see REQ-ALPI-012) 

--- Document Chunk 3215 ---
ALPI also, through I4 and I5, allows: 

--- Document Chunk 3216 ---
• the interaction of FAs with the communication system, via platform, towards the I06 interface 

--- Document Chunk 3217 ---
that manages communication with other FAs and external systems 

--- Document Chunk 3218 ---
• the interaction of FA s with the I1 interface and the entities outside the platform, for the 

--- Document Chunk 3219 ---
management of activities related to orchestration, diagnosis, security and time, update. 

--- Document Chunk 3220 ---
These activities are mainly implemented in RTE layer and are transparent to the ALPI runtime 

--- Document Chunk 3221 ---
interface.

7.4.3 Generic Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 3225 ---
Functional Applications realize a Business Logic. They are  part of a Functional System  and are 

--- Document Chunk 3226 ---
executed on  the Runtime Environment inside a computing platform. FA use runtime services 

--- Document Chunk 3227 ---
provided by ALPI interfaces I4 and I5.

7.4.4 Interface I4 and RTE 

--- Document Chunk 3237 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3238 ---
Figure 48: Interface I4 

--- Document Chunk 3239 ---
I4 goals: 

--- Document Chunk 3240 ---
• I4 shall standardize the access to RTE services, allowing FA developer s a simpler and 

--- Document Chunk 3241 ---
common way to develop FAs. 

--- Document Chunk 3242 ---
• I4 is a “runtime” interface, and it is assumed not to have “deployment interfaces”. The basic 

--- Document Chunk 3243 ---
deployment of an FS, and therefor a FA, is handled by the RTE and does not affect the 

--- Document Chunk 3244 ---
application. 

--- Document Chunk 3245 ---
• I4 provides FAs with all standard services for process management inside a RTE in relation 

--- Document Chunk 3246 ---
to memory and time. 

--- Document Chunk 3247 ---
• I4 provides FAs standard services to communicate with other applications and system. The 

--- Document Chunk 3248 ---
communication is realized via platform with I0 interface that is out of scope. 

--- Document Chunk 3249 ---
• I4 provides FAs a configuration structure to define specific behaviour of all services 

--- Document Chunk 3250 ---
• I4 provides FA s a configuration structure to identify every communication node of other 

--- Document Chunk 3251 ---
application or system needed to realize a Business Logic.

--- Document Chunk 3262 ---
I5 goals: 

--- Document Chunk 3263 ---
• I5 shall standardize the access to SE services, allowing to FA developer a simpler and 

--- Document Chunk 3264 ---
common way to develop SIL FA. 

--- Document Chunk 3265 ---
• I5 is a “runtime” interface, and it is assumed not having “deploy interfaces”. The basic 

--- Document Chunk 3266 ---
deployment of an FS, and so of a FA, is handled by the RTE and does not affect the 

--- Document Chunk 3267 ---
application. 

--- Document Chunk 3268 ---
• I5 provides FA s with all standard services for process management in relation to safety 

--- Document Chunk 3269 ---
related function that implement safety mechanisms to realize composite safety, such as 

--- Document Chunk 3270 ---
replica synchronization and execution.  

--- Document Chunk 3271 ---
• I5 provides FAs a configuration structure to define SIL of services that transparently manage 

--- Document Chunk 3272 ---
the safety mechanisms. 

--- Document Chunk 3273 ---
7.4.6 Implementation models 

--- Document Chunk 3274 ---
7.4.6.1 Functional Applications, Tasks and Deployment Configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3275 ---
Functional Applications implement the logic of typical railway functions. They consist of one or 

--- Document Chunk 3276 ---
multiple Tasks, each having distinct functions. Depending on a Task’s function in the system, it may 

--- Document Chunk 3277 ---
be restricted to use the corresponding limited subset of the ALPI and must comply with the applicable 

--- Document Chunk 3278 ---
defined set of standardised safety related application conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 3279 ---
To achieve deployment independence, every Functional Application shall include a platform -

--- Document Chunk 3280 ---
agnostic deployment configuration (see REQ-ALPI-018) that defines, for each Task, in a 

--- Document Chunk 3281 ---
standardised and abstracted way, its safety, resource (e.g., timing, memory, etc.) and 

--- Document Chunk 3282 ---
communication requirements.

--- Document Chunk 3288 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3289 ---
When integrating a Functional Application with a specific platform instance, the platform -agnostic 

--- Document Chunk 3290 ---
deployment configuration shall be translated to a platform specific application configuration.  

--- Document Chunk 3291 ---
A functional independence is required between different tasks (FAT-n) and shall be demonstrated. 

--- Document Chunk 3292 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3293 ---
Figure 50: Functional Applications, Tasks and Deployment Configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3294 ---
7.4.6.2 Messaging 

--- Document Chunk 3295 ---
Exchanging information via messages is a key service of the platform. The messaging concept shall 

--- Document Chunk 3296 ---
follow the below key paradigms: 

--- Document Chunk 3297 ---
• Location transparency: It shall be transparent to a Task of a Functional Application whether 

--- Document Chunk 3298 ---
it is communicating to a local entity (i.e., residing on the same local platform instance) or a 

--- Document Chunk 3299 ---
remote entity (i.e., residing on a remote platform instance); 

--- Document Chunk 3300 ---
• Replication transparency: It shall be transparent to Tasks of a Functional Application whether 

--- Document Chunk 3301 ---
they themselves, and the Tasks of the Functional Application they are exchanging messages 

--- Document Chunk 3302 ---
with, are replicated or not; 

--- Document Chunk 3303 ---
• Authentication and authorization transparency: Authentication and authorization of entities 

--- Document Chunk 3304 ---
shall be transparent to Tasks of a Functional Application, so that Tasks of a Functional 

--- Document Chunk 3305 ---
Application can trust that the entities they are receiving messages from or  transmitting 

--- Document Chunk 3306 ---
messages to are the entities they claim to be; 

--- Document Chunk 3307 ---
Messages between Tasks of a Functional Application or with Tasks of another Functional Application 

--- Document Chunk 3308 ---
shall be exchanged via Messaging Relations between the respective Tasks. Messaging Relations 

--- Document Chunk 3309 ---
shall be managed by the platform. They can be joined, or disjoin ed, registered or subscribed to. 

--- Document Chunk 3310 ---
Once a Messaging Relation between two entities is established it can be used to exchange 

--- Document Chunk 3311 ---
messages. 

--- Document Chunk 3312 ---
A Messaging Relation shall have various properties related to the usage of voting, the usage of 

--- Document Chunk 3313 ---
specific Safe Communication Protocols, quality of service, etc.

Figure 51: Messaging Relations between Tasks 

--- Document Chunk 3322 ---
Depending on the replication of the entities involved in a Messaging Relation, the message exchange 

--- Document Chunk 3323 ---
may involve message voting and/or distribution – both shall be transparently handled by the platform. 

--- Document Chunk 3324 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3325 ---
Figure 52: Message voting and distribution 

--- Document Chunk 3326 ---
Uni-directional Messaging Relation (publish/subscribe): the transmission of messages from one or 

--- Document Chunk 3327 ---
multiple publishing Tasks to one or multiple subscribing Tasks without implicit message 

--- Document Chunk 3328 ---
acknowledgement from the receiving side. Uni-directional Message Relations may have exactly one 

--- Document Chunk 3329 ---
publisher or multiple publishers. 

--- Document Chunk 3330 ---
Key characteristics: 

--- Document Chunk 3331 ---
• Posted messages (on the same Messaging Relation and by the same publisher) shall be 

--- Document Chunk 3332 ---
delivered to all subscribers in the exact same order as they have been published; 

--- Document Chunk 3333 ---
• Missing messages shall be identified by the platform (e.g., through the usage of message 

--- Document Chunk 3334 ---
sequence numbers or some other platform-specific mechanism). The subscribed entities shall 

--- Document Chunk 3335 ---
be notified by the Platform whenever there are missing messages; 

--- Document Chunk 3336 ---
• Messages shall be time -stamped by the platform, so that subscribers are able to determine 

--- Document Chunk 3337 ---
how old messages are, and whether they should still be processed or discarded, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 3338 ---
Bi-directional Messaging Relation (request/respond): the transmission of messages from exactly one 

--- Document Chunk 3339 ---
requesting Task to exactly one responding Task, with an explicit response message to each request 

--- Document Chunk 3340 ---

--- Document Chunk 3346 ---
message. A Bi -directional Messaging Relation can be used for requests from the requesting Task 

--- Document Chunk 3347 ---
once both sides have joined the Messaging Relation. 

--- Document Chunk 3348 ---
Key characteristics: 

--- Document Chunk 3349 ---
• Posted messages shall be received by the receiver in the exact same order as they have 

--- Document Chunk 3350 ---
been sent. This applies to both messages sent by the requester, and the response messages 

--- Document Chunk 3351 ---
sent by the responder; 

--- Document Chunk 3352 ---
• The platform shall deliver messages (both requests and responses) exactly once depending 

--- Document Chunk 3353 ---
on the performance achievable by the MP C implementation7 . It is to be investigated the 

--- Document Chunk 3354 ---
impact of this need on the design and architecture, and the possibility to adopt less stringent 

--- Document Chunk 3355 ---
constraints, consistent with safety requirements 

--- Document Chunk 3356 ---
• Messages shall be time-stamped, so that the involved Tasks are able to determine how old 

--- Document Chunk 3357 ---
messages are, and whether they should still process or discard them, etc 

--- Document Chunk 3358 ---
• The platform shall inform the requesting Task when the responding Task has joined the 

--- Document Chunk 3359 ---
Messaging Relation (for the first time, or, e.g., after a crash) 

--- Document Chunk 3360 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3361 ---
7.4.6.3 Task and Thread Scheduling 

--- Document Chunk 3362 ---
Platform implementations shall have the maximum freedom regarding the scheduling of Tasks of 

--- Document Chunk 3363 ---
Functional Applications, as long as a minimum set of design principles are met: 

--- Document Chunk 3364 ---
• Task replicas and their threads shall be scheduled based on the following kinds of triggers 

--- Document Chunk 3365 ---
(or combinations of theses):  

--- Document Chunk 3366 ---
o timer-based, i.e., in configured regular intervals, or in the form of one-shot timers; 

--- Document Chunk 3367 ---
o event-based, i.e., upon receipt of (certain types of messages); 

--- Document Chunk 3368 ---
o timer- and event-based, i.e., the Task obtains execution time in regular intervals, or in 

--- Document Chunk 3369 ---
the form of one-shot timers, only if (certain types of) messages have (or have not) been 

--- Document Chunk 3370 ---
received. 

--- Document Chunk 3371 ---
(see REQ-ALPI-028) 

--- Document Chunk 3372 ---
7.4.6.4 Time 

--- Document Chunk 3373 ---
7.4.6.4.1 Timestamps and Task replication 

--- Document Chunk 3374 ---
The platform shall be able to provide timestamps with the following three different quality attributes: 

--- Document Chunk 3375 ---
Unsynchronized Timestamp: corresponds to the time at the point when the replica requests this (and 

--- Document Chunk 3376 ---

is requested). This is especially important if the timestamp is used in 

--- Document Chunk 3390 ---
any voted output message. 

--- Document Chunk 3391 ---
Precision:  The precision of timestamp is application dependent and accuracy 

--- Document Chunk 3392 ---
varies accordingly . Precise timestamps are computationally much 

--- Document Chunk 3393 ---
more expensive than more imprecise ones.  This has an impact on 

--- Document Chunk 3394 ---
requirements and development. 

--- Document Chunk 3395 ---
Tasks must ensure that they only use the unsynchronized timestamp in cases where it doesn’t 

--- Document Chunk 3396 ---
impact any potentially voted output. The synchronized time may have a lower resolution than the 

--- Document Chunk 3397 ---
unsynchronized time.

--- Document Chunk 3400 ---
7.4.6.4.2 Timestamps and Messages 

--- Document Chunk 3401 ---
For safety as well as for availability reasons, it is essential for Tasks that messages are not delayed 

--- Document Chunk 3402 ---
beyond a defined maximum message delivery time. The platform shall supervise the message 

--- Document Chunk 3403 ---
delivery time and inform interested Tasks in case the maximum message delivery time is exceeded. 

--- Document Chunk 3404 ---
The platform shall complement messages exchanged via Messaging Relations with timestamps, 

--- Document Chunk 3405 ---
allowing receiving Tasks to make decisions based on the age of a received message and possibly 

--- Document Chunk 3406 ---
take appropriate action. 

--- Document Chunk 3407 ---
To calculate the age of a message, the notion of synchronized platform clocks (also among 

--- Document Chunk 3408 ---
distributed platforms) is necessary. Whether messages are complemented with relative or absolute 

--- Document Chunk 3409 ---
timestamps is for further study. 

--- Document Chunk 3410 ---
7.4.6.5 Gateway Concept 

--- Document Chunk 3411 ---
To enable Functional Applications to communicate with external entities, a gateway concept is 

--- Document Chunk 3412 ---
required. platform internal communication, i.e., communication between Tasks running on the same 

--- Document Chunk 3413 ---
platform, uses Messaging Relations as described in the pervious c hapter. In order to exchange 

--- Document Chunk 3414 ---
information between Tasks running on different platforms, a gateway is necessary. (see REQ-ALPI-

--- Document Chunk 3415 ---
032)

--- Document Chunk 3421 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3422 ---
Key paradigms regarding external communication are: 

--- Document Chunk 3423 ---
• it shall not be visible to a Task of a Functional Application whether it is communicating to 

--- Document Chunk 3424 ---
another entity on the same platform realization or a remote entity; 

--- Document Chunk 3425 ---
• it shall be possible to deploy Tasks of Functional Applications on different platform 

--- Document Chunk 3426 ---
realizations without having to change the Task implementation; 

--- Document Chunk 3427 ---
• required safe or non -safe communication protocols shall be separated from the Functional 

--- Document Chunk 3428 ---
Application to allow independent evolvement; 

--- Document Chunk 3429 ---
• it shall be possible to add new protocols (safe and non-safe) when they become available.  

--- Document Chunk 3430 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3431 ---
Figure 54: Gateway – contribution to protocol stack 

--- Document Chunk 3432 ---
The above scenario depicts a Task of Functional Application A sending a safety critical payload PL 

--- Document Chunk 3433 ---
to an external system using the gateway concept. The diagram shows how the different entities 

--- Document Chunk 3434 ---
involved contribute to the overall communications protocol stack toward the external entity.  

--- Document Chunk 3435 ---
The Gateway consists of three parts: the safe protocol handler, implementing the safety protocol 

--- Document Chunk 3436 ---
compliant with the required criticality (e.g., SIL4); the non -safe protocol handler implementing the 

--- Document Chunk 3437 ---
session layer protocol (e.g., FRMCS); and the platform services implementing voting to a single safe 

--- Document Chunk 3438 ---
output as well as providing the lower protocol layers e.g., UDP/TCP and IP. 

--- Document Chunk 3439 ---
7.4.6.6 Fault, error and failure handling and recovery 

--- Document Chunk 3440 ---
The chapter describes how faults, errors and failures shall be handled in context of replicated Tasks 

--- Document Chunk 3441 ---
and virtual/physical Computing Elements. The subsequent sections follow the terminology used in

result, Functional Application(s) are 

--- Document Chunk 3488 ---
impacted in the way that these lose 

--- Document Chunk 3489 ---
the ability to perform as required. 

--- Document Chunk 3490 ---

--- Document Chunk 3491 ---
Table 5: Fault, Error and Failure in the context of replicated tasks 

--- Document Chunk 3492 ---
7.4.6.6.1 Fault Detection and Response 

--- Document Chunk 3493 ---
To what extent the platform performs fault detection is platform implementation specific. 

--- Document Chunk 3494 ---
Nevertheless, Task fault containment must be ensured by sufficient independence between Task 

--- Document Chunk 3495 ---
replicas (according to EN 50129:2018). It is also left to the discretion of the platform implementation 

--- Document Chunk 3496 ---
to decide whether a fault (according to EN 20129:2018) has to be flagged as an error. 

--- Document Chunk 3497 ---
7.4.6.6.2 Error Detection and Response 

--- Document Chunk 3498 ---
Errors shall be detected and handled according to EN 50129:2018. In addition, the platform shall 

--- Document Chunk 3499 ---
take the following recovery and informational actions: 

--- Document Chunk 3500 ---
Affected entity Actions 

--- Document Chunk 3501 ---
Task replica • Restart the Task replica, recover its state and re-integrate it with its 

--- Document Chunk 3502 ---
counterpart replicas. 

--- Document Chunk 3503 ---
• Inform interested Tasks about the affected Task replica failure. 

--- Document Chunk 3504 ---
Computing Element • Restart the virtual/physical Computing Element and recover or restart 

--- Document Chunk 3505 ---
all affected Runtime Environment instances and Task replicas, 

--- Document Chunk 3506 ---
recover their state and re-integrate them with their counterpart 

--- Document Chunk 3507 ---
replicas. 

--- Document Chunk 3508 ---
• Inform interested Tasks about the affected Task replicas failure. 

--- Document Chunk 3509 ---
Table 6: Error detection and response for different entities 

--- Document Chunk 3510 ---
In case all recovery actions defined in the above table are unsuccessful (e.g., due to repeated Task 

--- Document Chunk 3511 ---
replica and/or Computing Element failure, or because more replicas of the same Task are affected

--- Document Chunk 3518 ---
than the redundancy/voting configuration allows for), this results in a failure (according to EN 

--- Document Chunk 3519 ---
50129:2018). 

--- Document Chunk 3520 ---
7.4.6.6.3 Failure Response 

--- Document Chunk 3521 ---
A failure implies that one or multiple Task(s) are no longer able to perform as required. In this case, 

--- Document Chunk 3522 ---
the platform reaction shall be as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 3523 ---
• informs all Tasks that have a Messaging Relation with the affected Task 

--- Document Chunk 3524 ---
• informs all Tasks that have registered for diagnostics information about the affected Task 

--- Document Chunk 3525 ---
7.4.6.7 Communication Model 

--- Document Chunk 3526 ---
The ALPI interface assumes that communications made via the platform, using the I0 interface, are 

--- Document Chunk 3527 ---
not within the scope of this document. 

--- Document Chunk 3528 ---
With reference to Figure 47, the FA performs processing on input data and produces output results 

--- Document Chunk 3529 ---
that are managed through a communication system. Communication can take place either within the 

--- Document Chunk 3530 ---
FS or with other external FAs or systems. In order to facilitate and standardize the development of 

--- Document Chunk 3531 ---
the application, the ALPI interface shall provide a single model of communication services that make 

--- Document Chunk 3532 ---
it transparent to the FA whether the peer node is internal to the FS or it belongs to another external 

--- Document Chunk 3533 ---
system. The information that defines the node type, and therefore that allows the RTE layers to 

--- Document Chunk 3534 ---
implement the communication  correctly, is specified in the configuration part of ALPI. The 

--- Document Chunk 3535 ---
communication services provided by ALP I, after appropriate configuration, allow to implement with 

--- Document Chunk 3536 ---
a single standard model, every elementary communication between the basic components (FAT) 

--- Document Chunk 3537 ---
constituting an FA. 

--- Document Chunk 3538 ---
ALPI communication interface is based on platform services based on messages as described in 

--- Document Chunk 3539 ---
chapter 7.4.6.2. 

--- Document Chunk 3540 ---
7.4.7 Certification 

--- Document Chunk 3541 ---
The discussion around this aspect of application-level platform independence  has not started yet.  

--- Document Chunk 3542 ---
However, there is a dedicated subsequent task in this work package to study certification approaches 

--- Document Chunk 3543 ---
for modular platforms. 

--- Document Chunk 3544 ---
7.4.8 Safety 

--- Document Chunk 3545 ---
The MCP allows the management of non-safety related, Basic Integrity Level, and safety-related up 

--- Document Chunk 3546 ---
to SIL4 Functional Applications. In the case of non -safety related FAs, the FA uses all services 

--- Document Chunk 3547 ---
available in the RTE without restrictions. In the case of BIL, the FA uses only RTE services compliant 

--- Document Chunk 3548 ---
with BIL. In the case of SIL4, the Functional Application is implemented through the adoption of 

--- Document Chunk 3549 ---
mechanisms based on composite safety, which is ensured through redundant architectures 

--- Document Chunk 3550 ---
compliant with the standard  (CENELEC EN50126 / EN50716 ). The services provided by  I5 ALPI 

--- Document Chunk 3551 ---
effectively enhance transparency by consolidating safety -related data within a secure safety layer 

--- Document Chunk 3552 ---
safety layer.  

--- Document Chunk 3553 ---
The runtime consolidation of the safety-related data is executed through I5 using specific information 

--- Document Chunk 3554 ---
defined in the configuration part of ALPI.

--- Document Chunk 3561 ---
7.4.9  Security 

--- Document Chunk 3562 ---
The ALPI shall provide runtime Security functions in the scope of the Functional Application. 

--- Document Chunk 3563 ---
MPC’s Security related to external communication is managed end-to-end with TLS at network level. 

--- Document Chunk 3564 ---
It stops within the RTE, at kernel level, below I4/I5. So, it is not in scope of runtime services of ALPI. 

--- Document Chunk 3565 ---
For the security functions in the scope of the Functional Application the ALPI shall provide runtime 

--- Document Chunk 3566 ---
and configuration services allowing FA to use security services , such as  PKI management, 

--- Document Chunk 3567 ---
authentication management, cryptographic verification/validation inside FATs. (see REQ-ALPI-034) 

--- Document Chunk 3568 ---
With reference to the paragraph  6.8, security features should be implemented within each FS. 

--- Document Chunk 3569 ---
Depending on the solutions and architecture used, the impact on ALPI should consist in the use of 

--- Document Chunk 3570 ---
a standard interface provided by the IT -Security Layer and included in I4 ( chapter 6.8.2), or an 

--- Document Chunk 3571 ---
integration in I4 of a specific interface towards a compartment dedicated to IT security functionalities. 

--- Document Chunk 3572 ---
(chapter 6.8.3). 

--- Document Chunk 3573 ---
7.4.10 Diagnosis 

--- Document Chunk 3574 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3575 ---
Figure 55: ALPI diagnosis-provided through RTE at CP level 

--- Document Chunk 3576 ---
FA’s diagnosis data must be provided via the interface I1 (towards the Shared Services Diagnosis) 

--- Document Chunk 3577 ---
that is considered a central data sink. The ALPI provide s runtime services and configuration 

--- Document Chunk 3578 ---
structures that allow direct and implicit collection of diagnostic data. This data will be transformed 

--- Document Chunk 3579 ---
within the Platform Management into I1 compatible format. 

--- Document Chunk 3580 ---
FA uses runtime ALPI’s diagnostic services to provide relevant diagnosis data for root cause analysis 

--- Document Chunk 3581 ---
and automated initiation of maintenance activities. 

--- Document Chunk 3582 ---
7.4.10.1 Diagnosis of the FA 

--- Document Chunk 3583 ---
Each FA shall provide diagnosis data about its own health state (e.g. about the health state of running 

--- Document Chunk 3584 ---
FATs, the outcome of plausibility checks for the Business logic, …). 

--- Document Chunk 3585 ---

--- Document Chunk 3590 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3591 ---
This FA diagnosis data, provided via ALPI services, shall be available to the FS to be sent to I1 

--- Document Chunk 3592 ---
Diagnosis Interface. 

--- Document Chunk 3593 ---
FA Diagnosis data is related to faults, errors and failures described in paragraph 7.4.7.6. Some of 

--- Document Chunk 3594 ---
these are detected at RTE level and aren’t in scope of FA. Relevant FA diagnosis data, detectable 

--- Document Chunk 3595 ---
at RTE level, to be provided towards Platform Management is: 

--- Document Chunk 3596 ---
• state of each individual FAT 

--- Document Chunk 3597 ---
• state of the communication between FATs 

--- Document Chunk 3598 ---
• … 

--- Document Chunk 3599 ---
7.4.11  Maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 3600 ---
ALPI’s I4 and I5 are mainly runtime interfaces, not deploy interfaces. Maintenance and deployment 

--- Document Chunk 3601 ---
are done at FS level and are not in scope of runtime services of ALPI 

--- Document Chunk 3602 ---
The basic deployment of an FS is handled by the RTE  (below I4/I5 ) and does not affect the 

--- Document Chunk 3603 ---
application. 

--- Document Chunk 3604 ---
The maintenance services are done through  appropriate external interfaces. External entities 

--- Document Chunk 3605 ---
manage the ways to build, deploy and maintain a full MPC system and in particular FA & ALPI. (see 

--- Document Chunk 3606 ---
REQ-ALPI-035) 

--- Document Chunk 3607 ---
7.5 COLLECTION OF TOPICS FOR FUTURE STUDY 

--- Document Chunk 3608 ---
This chapter lists several open topics with regards to Application-level Platform Independence (ALPI)

--- Document Chunk 3614 ---
abstraction mechanisms, e.g. to achieve independence from a specific RTE implementation 

--- Document Chunk 3615 ---
• definition of acceptable migration effort from one platform to another (on a scale from binary 

--- Document Chunk 3616 ---

feasible 

--- Document Chunk 3619 ---
• possibilities for identification and definition of harmonised SRACs 

--- Document Chunk 3620 ---
• integration of diagnostics interfaces for application usage (e.g. operation data coming from

• Versioning for all artefacts (also in the context of integration efforts in modular PRAMS). The

--- Document Chunk 3655 ---
7.6 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 

--- Document Chunk 3656 ---
While previous work and the discussions outlined in this chapter already show on a high level what 

--- Document Chunk 3657 ---
a future modular platform could look like, there is still a lot of work needed to create a coherent and 

--- Document Chunk 3658 ---
useful concept for the ALPI – the Application-level Platform Independence. 

--- Document Chunk 3659 ---
The goals of independence, standardization and ease of use for the definition of the ALPI interface 

--- Document Chunk 3660 ---
pose new challenges that imply assumptions for a correct compromise with the complexity of a 

--- Document Chunk 3661 ---
modular platform. Based on the reported description, it was found that the common definition of the 

--- Document Chunk 3662 ---
I4 interface is influenced by the following factors: 

--- Document Chunk 3663 ---
• Level of independence of ALPI: The common high -level description of ALPI highly depends 

--- Document Chunk 3664 ---
on the choice of RTE. In case of a single RTE provider, the description of the I4 interface 

--- Document Chunk 3665 ---
coincides with that of the RTE itself; in case of RTE from different supplie rs, a specific 

--- Document Chunk 3666 ---
adaptation interface for each RTE should be provided in addition. 

--- Document Chunk 3667 ---
• Level of transparency for safety: based on what is provided by the Safety Environment, I5 

--- Document Chunk 3668 ---
should provide complete transparency about consolidations required for up to SIL4 or in any 

--- Document Chunk 3669 ---
case a minimum set of runtime services. Complete transparency implies a clear definition of 

--- Document Chunk 3670 ---
the SIL of input/output data at configuration time.

--- Document Chunk 3676 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3677 ---
• Level of transparency for security: security communication is not taken in account by ALPI , 

--- Document Chunk 3678 ---
being managed end -to-end by the underlying layers. ALPI, during the configuration phase, 

--- Document Chunk 3679 ---
must allow the selection of appropriate security -oriented protocols to be implemented by 

--- Document Chunk 3680 ---
lower levels. 

--- Document Chunk 3681 ---
• Deployment, maintenance: I4 is primarily a runtime interface, so deployment and 

--- Document Chunk 3682 ---
maintenance is delegated to specific tools provided by the RTE at FS level. In this case, ALPI 

--- Document Chunk 3683 ---
requires a configuration data structure for the aggregation of the basic componen ts. The 

--- Document Chunk 3684 ---
aggregation is managed at FS level. 

--- Document Chunk 3685 ---
Possible choices for further simplifications and standardizations: the descriptions of I4 and I5 are 

--- Document Chunk 3686 ---
based on the safety integrity level of services. It is possible either an incremental approach in which 

--- Document Chunk 3687 ---
a safety-related FA uses I4 by default and adds I5 for the part involving the SE, or it uses an I5 that 

--- Document Chunk 3688 ---
integrates a restricted I4, in congruence with the target SIL 1 up to 4. 

--- Document Chunk 3689 ---
The definition of the requirements in the appendix was made on the basis of an independent 

--- Document Chunk 3690 ---
approach, which however also took into account the results of the solutions proposed in chapters 6 

--- Document Chunk 3691 ---
and 8. 

--- Document Chunk 3692 ---
7.6.1 Open points 

--- Document Chunk 3693 ---
7.6.1.1 RTE Single/multi provider  

--- Document Chunk 3694 ---
ALPI’s scope is to propose a common high level API description. This can be facilitated through the 

--- Document Chunk 3695 ---
choice of a single RTE provider. In the case of different RTEs, ALPIs will have to include "adapters" 

--- Document Chunk 3696 ---
and the management of the associated complexities. The choice to impose any constraints on the 

--- Document Chunk 3697 ---
RTE provider, in order to simplify the implementation of ALPI, should be evaluated in consideration 

--- Document Chunk 3698 ---
of the trade-off between flexibility in the choice of multi supplier and the related additional complexity 

--- Document Chunk 3699 ---
associated with the introduction of "adapters" for RTEs harmonization. 

--- Document Chunk 3700 ---
7.6.1.2 Consistent safety 

--- Document Chunk 3701 ---
With reference to safety management, the modularity and independence of the ALPI SW from the 

--- Document Chunk 3702 ---
MPC are not sufficient and it is necessary to introduce an overall safety mechanism to ensure that 

--- Document Chunk 3703 ---
the safe system is consistent. That is, to ensure that a change of version of ALPI, both I4 and I5, is 

--- Document Chunk 3704 ---
congruent with the SE. This mechanism must be considered in the ALPI configuration data structure.

8 MANAGEMENT, DIAGNOSTICS AND SECURITY RELATED 

--- Document Chunk 3712 ---
INTERFACES 

--- Document Chunk 3713 ---
This chapter deals with  platform management, diagnostics and security related interfaces, either 

--- Document Chunk 3714 ---
internal to the platform , or external to the platform,  the latter b eing referred to as “I1”  (see 

--- Document Chunk 3715 ---
Chapters 3.7.1 and 5). The interfaces are important for integration and interoperability of modular 

--- Document Chunk 3716 ---
platforms into the railways’ computing landscape and operations. The interfaces discussed here are 

--- Document Chunk 3717 ---
platform-centric and do explicitly not cater to the needs of the functional applications executed on 

--- Document Chunk 3718 ---
such a modular platform. 

--- Document Chunk 3719 ---
8.1 OVERVIEW ON THE INTERFACES 

--- Document Chunk 3720 ---
An overview on the stated interfaces is provided in Figure 56 . The high-level components introduced 

--- Document Chunk 3721 ---
in this context are described in Table 7.

--- Document Chunk 3731 ---
The Compartment Execution and Management Environment comprises the 

--- Document Chunk 3732 ---
hardware and virtualisation environment along with related (proprietary) 

--- Document Chunk 3733 ---

Entity Description 

--- Document Chunk 3742 ---
As shown in Figure 49, the CEME is expected to be 100% Commercial-of-the-

--- Document Chunk 3743 ---
shelf (COTS), except for the Native Hardware Access (NHA) function that may 

--- Document Chunk 3744 ---
potentially not be COTS and that is required by the Safety Environments to 

--- Document Chunk 3745 ---
support Functional Systems with a SIL level. 

--- Document Chunk 3746 ---
Functional System(s) Functional System(s) are defined in chapters 3.7.2 and 5. In the context of the 

--- Document Chunk 3747 ---
interfaces covered in this chapter, it is important to note that the Functional 

--- Document Chunk 3748 ---
Systems(s) are expected to contain: 

--- Document Chunk 3749 ---
• FS Diagnostics Server: Entity running in a dedicated Compartment 

--- Document Chunk 3750 ---
and/or together with a Functional Application in an FS Compartment, 

--- Document Chunk 3751 ---
which provides diagnostics information to the Platform Management and 

--- Document Chunk 3752 ---
to Shared Services 

--- Document Chunk 3753 ---
• FS Update Client: Entity running in a dedicated Compartment or 

--- Document Chunk 3754 ---
together with a Functional Application in an FS Compartment, which 

--- Document Chunk 3755 ---
responds to and executes update requests from the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 3756 ---
Management or Shared Services 

--- Document Chunk 3757 ---
Shared Services Shared Services are standardized services related to IT security (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 3758 ---
authentication, certificate management), global time provisioning, diagnostics 

--- Document Chunk 3759 ---
and configuration management / update that are located outside the platform. 

--- Document Chunk 3760 ---
Platform 

--- Document Chunk 3761 ---
Management 

--- Document Chunk 3762 ---
This entity supervises the operation of the Functional Systems running on the 

--- Document Chunk 3763 ---
Virtual Computing Elements in one (or multiple) location(s), e.g. data centre(s). It 

--- Document Chunk 3764 ---
obtains diagnostics information from the FS Diagnostics Server within the 

--- Document Chunk 3765 ---
Functional Systems and from the Hardware and Virtualisation related 

--- Document Chunk 3766 ---
Diagnostics Functions within the CEME. It forwards the information, as 

--- Document Chunk 3767 ---
appropriate, to the Shared Services via I1-DIAG and reacts by triggering 

--- Document Chunk 3768 ---
appropriate actions, e.g., the creation of new Virtual Computing Elements inside 

--- Document Chunk 3769 ---
the Virtualisation Environment or restarting Physical Computing Elements if 

--- Document Chunk 3770 ---
needed. 

--- Document Chunk 3771 ---
Note: The Platform Management is not safety-relevant (but ensures the 

--- Document Chunk 3772 ---
fulfilment of RAM requirements during operation), as the Functional Systems 

--- Document Chunk 3773 ---
themselves (and the Safety Environments therein) always ensure a safe state 

--- Document Chunk 3774 ---
and safe output. It is assumed that the Platform Management provides a highly 

--- Document Chunk 3775 ---
standardized functionality in the way that it reacts to information arriving via 

--- Document Chunk 3776 ---
CEME-DIAG and/or MGMT-DIAG by triggering actions via ORCH and/or FS-

--- Document Chunk 3777 ---
UPDATE in a standardized way, potentially involving FS-specific policies. 

--- Document Chunk 3778 ---
The Platform Management implements the MPC specific interfaces and 

--- Document Chunk 3779 ---
abovementioned functionality, potentially utilising as much as feasible COTS 

--- Document Chunk 3780 ---
solutions, e.g., OpenStack or other solutions.

• The former “PLAT_UPDATE”  / “IF_ORCHESTRATION” interface is now split into two 

--- Document Chunk 3910 ---
interfaces “ORCH” and “FS-UPDATE”, as the y terminate at different points  and refer to 

--- Document Chunk 3911 ---
different layers in the technology stack: 

--- Document Chunk 3912 ---
o The ORCH interface is between the Platform Management and the Virtual Machine 

--- Document Chunk 3913 ---
Management within the CEME . It is used to manage the setup of Virtualization 

--- Document Chunk 3914 ---
Environments, Virtual Computing Elements, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 3915 ---
o The FS-UPDATE interface i s between the  Platform Management and the FS Update 

--- Document Chunk 3916 ---
Client(s) in the Functional System(s) . It is used to supervise Functional System 

--- Document Chunk 3917 ---
(Compartment) updates in alignment with configurations of the Virtual Computing 

--- Document Chunk 3918 ---
Elements. 

--- Document Chunk 3919 ---
• The former “PLAT_HEALTHMGMT” / “IF_DIAGNOSTICS” interface is similar ly split into two 

--- Document Chunk 3920 ---
interfaces CEME-DIAG and MGMT -DIAG, also because they terminate at different entities 

--- Document Chunk 3921 ---
and refer to different layers in the technology stack: 

--- Document Chunk 3922 ---
o The CEME-DIAG interface is between the CEME and the Platform Management, 

--- Document Chunk 3923 ---
conveying diagnostics information related to hardware, the Virtualization Environment, 

--- Document Chunk 3924 ---
Virtual Computing Elements etc. 

--- Document Chunk 3925 ---
o The MGMT -DIAG interface is between the FS Diagnostics Server and the Platform 

--- Document Chunk 3926 ---
Management, conveying diagnostics information obtained from the application domain.  

--- Document Chunk 3927 ---
8.2 GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS ON THE INTERFACES 

--- Document Chunk 3928 ---
It is important to note that the aforementioned interfaces are all assumed to be not safety relevant. 

--- Document Chunk 3929 ---
Their failure may have an impact on the availability of a Modular Computing Platform (e.g., because 

--- Document Chunk 3930 ---
the Platform Management is not able to correctly react to a hardware or software failure), but 

--- Document Chunk 3931 ---
mechanisms in the Functional Systems (or in the Safety Layer therein) always ensure that safety is 

--- Document Chunk 3932 ---
fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 3933 ---
Regarding updates of Functional Systems  and the usage of the I1-UPDATE and FS-UPDATE 

--- Document Chunk 3934 ---
interfaces it is also important to note that at this point two proposals shall be provided as potential 

--- Document Chunk 3935 ---
options for further study: 

--- Document Chunk 3936 ---
a) Shared Services could directly interface to the FS Update Clients in the FS 

--- Document Chunk 3937 ---
Compartments via I1-UPDATE to trigger updates of Functional Systems  (Compartments). 

--- Document Chunk 3938 ---
This requires that Shared Services are aware that Functional Systems run in the form of 

--- Document Chunk 3939 ---
redundant replicas in multiple FS Compartments and  need potentially  awareness of 

--- Document Chunk 3940 ---
constraints or procedures that have to be considered for the update of these (for instance, 

--- Document Chunk 3941 ---
FS Compartments may have to be stopped, updated and started in a certain order or with 

--- Document Chunk 3942 ---
certain timing constraints, etc.). In this case, the Platform Management needs to be informed 

--- Document Chunk 3943 ---
about any FS Compartment updates triggered by the Share d Services, so that it can 

--- Document Chunk 3944 ---
supervise needed activities appropriately (and for instance correctly trigger the re-creation of 

--- Document Chunk 3945 ---
a Virtual Computing Element) when FS Compartment failures are reported through the 

--- Document Chunk 3946 ---
MGMT-DIAG interface.  

--- Document Chunk 3947 ---
b) Shared Services interface to the Platform Management  and direct any update requests 

--- Document Chunk 3948 ---
related to Functional Systems to the Platform Management. In this case, the Shared Services 

--- Document Chunk 3949 ---
need not be aware of the deployment of replicas and FS Compartments , but rather see a 

--- Document Chunk 3950 ---
Functional System as one atomic entitity that can be updated as a whole based on provided 

--- Document Chunk 3951 ---
 Contract No. HE – 101102001 

--- Document Chunk 3952 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 3953 ---

FP2-WP26-D-DBN-003-06 Page 112 of 171 25/07/2025 

--- Document Chunk 3956 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3957 ---
information. The Platform Management, being aware of the notion of FS Compartments and 

--- Document Chunk 3958 ---
the related FS Deployment Rules, can then translate update requests from Shared Services 

--- Document Chunk 3959 ---
into a sequence of requests via FS_UPDATE to the FS Update Clients in the FS 

--- Document Chunk 3960 ---
Compartments, also taking into account FS Deployment Rule specific timing constraints, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 3961 ---
Which of such options is to be used (or whether both would possibly be used concurrently or in 

--- Document Chunk 3962 ---
combination) needs further investigation. It is assumed that option a) above introduced higher 

--- Document Chunk 3963 ---
demands on the I1-UPDATE interface specified in the TCCS domain, as the Shared Services need 

--- Document Chunk 3964 ---
to apply configuration and software updates of Functional Systems, e.g., running in data centres on 

--- Document Chunk 3965 ---
a different granularity and with different constraints than when performing configuration updates of, 

--- Document Chunk 3966 ---
e.g., field elements as currently foreseen. Option b) may require less complexity on the I1-UPDATE 

--- Document Chunk 3967 ---
interface specified in the TCCS domain, as the Platform Management, where the interface would 

--- Document Chunk 3968 ---
terminate on the platform side, would supervise the implementation, managing their complexity and 

--- Document Chunk 3969 ---
constraints. 

--- Document Chunk 3970 ---
8.3 REQUIREMENTS ON THE INTERFACES 

--- Document Chunk 3971 ---
The requirements for the interfaces mentioned can be found in  Appendix D , Management, 

--- Document Chunk 3972 ---
Diagnostics and Security related Interface Requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 3973 ---
The requirements for interfaces being part of I1 (e.g.,  I1-DIAG, I1-UPDATE, I1-SEC) are not in the 

--- Document Chunk 3974 ---
scope of work package 26. These interfaces are specified in the System Pillar TCCS domain.  It is 

--- Document Chunk 3975 ---
assumed that the modular platform concept and the entities described in this chapter would reuse 

--- Document Chunk 3976 ---
the I1-DIAG and I1-SEC as they are considered in the TCCS domain so far , without posing MPC -

--- Document Chunk 3977 ---
specific requirements. However, it is still to be checked , ideally in the dialogue between R2DATO 

--- Document Chunk 3978 ---
and the TCCS domain in the System Pillar whether this is indeed the case. 

--- Document Chunk 3979 ---
For the I1 -UPDATE, as stated in Section 8.2, further investigations are required w.r.t. how this 

--- Document Chunk 3980 ---
interface is used in concurrence with FS-UPDATE. From this investigation, further requirements on 

--- Document Chunk 3981 ---
I1-UPDATE may be derived that would have to be considered in the TCCS domain. 

--- Document Chunk 3982 ---
8.4 CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS 

--- Document Chunk 3983 ---
This chapter has delved into platform management, diagnostics and security related interfaces. A 

--- Document Chunk 3984 ---
distinction has been drawn between interfaces within the CPI – Compatible Platform Implementation 

--- Document Chunk 3985 ---
(ORCH, CEME-DIAG, FS-UPDATE, MGMT-DIAG) and those toward Shared Services external to 

--- Document Chunk 3986 ---
the CPI (I1-DIAG, I1-SEC, I1-UPDATE). 

--- Document Chunk 3987 ---
For the interfaces within the CPI, requirements have been derived . The common understanding is 

--- Document Chunk 3988 ---
that 

--- Document Chunk 3989 ---
• The interfaces from the Platform Management to the Functional Systems - MGMT-DIAG and 

--- Document Chunk 3990 ---
FS-UPDATE - are specific to the MPC and can be specified exactly according to the identified 

--- Document Chunk 3991 ---
MPC needs. Here, the next steps are to further develop the concept and subsequently identify 

--- Document Chunk 3992 ---
suitable existing protocols for these interfaces and specify the interfaces in detail; 

--- Document Chunk 3993 ---
• The interfaces from the Platform Management to the Compartment Execution and 

--- Document Chunk 3994 ---
Management Environment (CEME) – ORCH and CEME-DIAG - are expected to be based 

--- Document Chunk 3995 ---
on existing interfaces provided by existing COTS implementations of the CEME. Here, there 

--- Document Chunk 3996 ---
is hence no degree of freedom to specify these interfaces, but it rather has to be checked 

--- Document Chunk 3997 ---
whether existing COTS solutions fulfill the requirements on these interfaces identified in this

--- Document Chunk 4003 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 4004 ---
deliverable. At the time of writing of this deliverable, there is confidence that there are multiple 

--- Document Chunk 4005 ---
COTS solutions on the market that can meet the requirements, but a detailed (gap) analysis 

--- Document Chunk 4006 ---
has to be performed. 

--- Document Chunk 4007 ---
For the interfaces from the CPI to the Shared Services – I1-UPDATE, I1-DIAG and I1-SEC – it has 

--- Document Chunk 4008 ---
to be discussed with the ERJU System Pillar TCCS domain , as noted in Sections 8.2 and 8.3, how 

--- Document Chunk 4009 ---
these interfaces are exactly to be used in the MPC context, and whether additional requirements 

--- Document Chunk 4010 ---
may be posed on these from the MPC context beyond the requirements already considered in the 

--- Document Chunk 4011 ---
TCCS domain.

9 CONCLUSIONS 

--- Document Chunk 4019 ---
Modular computing platforms are  a proven concept in many areas, and this success already 

--- Document Chunk 4020 ---
motivated many endeavours to enable their usage in the railway domain [18]. Work package 26, 

--- Document Chunk 4021 ---
within the environment of ERJU Innovation Pillar Focus Project 2 R2DATO, applied the state-of-the-

--- Document Chunk 4022 ---
art to the input and the guidance from the ERJU System Pillar, most importantly from the Computing 

--- Document Chunk 4023 ---
Environment domain, and elaborated on important, railway specific aspects. 

--- Document Chunk 4024 ---
This activity created the “Modular Platform Concept” (MPC), which is presented in detail in this 

--- Document Chunk 4025 ---
deliverable. The analysis and concept work are expected to further contribute to ERJU SP progress, 

--- Document Chunk 4026 ---
supporting the domains in defining a suitable environment for modular platforms to be commissioned 

--- Document Chunk 4027 ---
in the future. 

--- Document Chunk 4028 ---
The MPC is  presented with a basic analysis (see chapter  3), as high-level requirements (see 

--- Document Chunk 4029 ---
chapter 4 respectively Appendix A), and the architecture concept (chapter  5). The MPC is built on 

--- Document Chunk 4030 ---
three internal ideas (HLPI, ALPI, and respective interfaces; see chapters 6, 7, and 8) and provides 

--- Document Chunk 4031 ---
external interfaces for operational integration as specified by ERJU System Pillar. 

--- Document Chunk 4032 ---
The overall outcome has two facets: Modular platforms  as the MPC are feasible in the railway 

--- Document Chunk 4033 ---
context. However, the complexity of a fully defined MPC for safety functions set limits to the depth 

--- Document Chunk 4034 ---
of specification that can be presented here. As well, it’s an ongoing discussion what actual level of 

--- Document Chunk 4035 ---
definition respectively harmonization  of a platform keeps the right balance between inter change-

--- Document Chunk 4036 ---
ability and potential for future innovation and differentiation. 

--- Document Chunk 4037 ---
As such, the specification presented is not final  and implementable  in a way that would fulfil all  

--- Document Chunk 4038 ---
variants of interchangeability, nor would a final & fixed specification have been advantageous at the 

--- Document Chunk 4039 ---
time this deliverable was to be finished.  This is due to several dependencies  and implications , 

--- Document Chunk 4040 ---
content- and timewise: 

--- Document Chunk 4041 ---
• A final specification is expected to describe platform implementations that are certifieable 

--- Document Chunk 4042 ---
and allow for modularity in a way that enables the stated goals. This will be analysed in work 

--- Document Chunk 4043 ---
package 26’s next task and its results will further guide the MPC specification. 

--- Document Chunk 4044 ---
• The input received from the System Pillar was limited to information received via the FP2 

--- Document Chunk 4045 ---
Cluster System engineer respectively via direct contacts in the appropriate ERJU SP 

--- Document Chunk 4046 ---
domains. This input was not stable and changed regularly.  When this deliverable was due, 

--- Document Chunk 4047 ---
there were no published inputs from the relevant SP domains. 

--- Document Chunk 4048 ---
• The input from the SP CE domain  as shown in chapter  3.7.1 was in some aspects 

--- Document Chunk 4049 ---
unexpected and did not align with the goals of all of work package 26’s members.  The 

--- Document Chunk 4050 ---
approach planned in work package 26’s first deliverable  [18] was not fully compatible with 

--- Document Chunk 4051 ---
the input received from the CE domain [14], especially the introduction and prioritization of I2 

--- Document Chunk 4052 ---
and I3, as well as the different design of I1 were not expected. On one hand, the increasing 

--- Document Chunk 4053 ---
scope helped t he definition of ALPI and HLPI, as introduced in work package 26’s second 

--- Document Chunk 4054 ---
deliverable and explained in detail in this current deliverable . On the other hand, the 

--- Document Chunk 4055 ---
complexity similarly rose. Continous alignment with the SP CE domain helped to steer work 

--- Document Chunk 4056 ---
package 26 into the right direction. 

--- Document Chunk 4057 ---
• The SP CE domain conclusion and final output on the computing environment is likely several 

--- Document Chunk 4058 ---
years out.

--- Document Chunk 4065 ---
• While it was not expected to be available in the timeframe, it’s still relevant to note that there 

--- Document Chunk 4066 ---
is no input yet, e.g. in the form of requirements, coming from any application in the R2DATO 

--- Document Chunk 4067 ---
context that would target the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 4068 ---
• In the environment described in the bullet points above, it’s not feasible to decide on a clear 

--- Document Chunk 4069 ---
strategy for standardization a pproaches in the MPC.  The goal of interchangeability can be 

--- Document Chunk 4070 ---
reached on many different  granularities and levels. Not limiting future innovation  while 

--- Document Chunk 4071 ---
creating beneficial harmonizations in the architecture and/or interface realms, however, is a 

--- Document Chunk 4072 ---
hard requirement for future adoption of the MPC.  Existing developments in the sector have 

--- Document Chunk 4073 ---
to be taken into account, and a good and informed compromise needs to be found. One option 

--- Document Chunk 4074 ---
is to gain the necessary knowledge and drive the adoption in demonstrator projects, such as 

--- Document Chunk 4075 ---
the “Onboard Platform Demonstrator” work package 36 in R2DATO, the demonstrator cluster 

--- Document Chunk 4076 ---
of R2DATO in general,  and future phases of R2DATO respectively ERJU.  Another option 

--- Document Chunk 4077 ---
could be to collect insights from incumbent platform vendors and design the MPC interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 4078 ---
accordingly. This has last option naturally has been applied to this deliverable already, as the 

--- Document Chunk 4079 ---
authors of the relevant chapters have insights into their companies experiences in this field. 

--- Document Chunk 4080 ---
Despite all these factors and caveats, this deliverable shows a concrete and complete picture of the 

--- Document Chunk 4081 ---
Modular Platform Concept , highlighting many important considerations , requirements, approaches 

--- Document Chunk 4082 ---
for safety and security , and enables the sourcing of relevant core technologies as commercial-off-

--- Document Chunk 4083 ---
the-shelf (COTS) products. 

--- Document Chunk 4084 ---
1) Complete picture of the MPC  

--- Document Chunk 4085 ---
Chapter 3 “Modular Platforms Concept (MPC)” introduced and discussed purpose, scope, 

--- Document Chunk 4086 ---
stakeholders, goals, non-goals, assumptions, known issues and limitation, the alignment with 

--- Document Chunk 4087 ---
the ERJU System Pillar , PRAMSS approaches, user stories, operational context and 

--- Document Chunk 4088 ---
scenarios, intended usage scenarios and platform environment examples . In chapter  4 

--- Document Chunk 4089 ---
“Modular Platforms Requirements ”, the methodology and sources for an updated and 

--- Document Chunk 4090 ---
comprehensive set of high-level modular platform requirements were presented, leading to 

--- Document Chunk 4091 ---
the actual list of requirements in  Appendix A  “MPC Requ irements”. Subsequently, in 

--- Document Chunk 4092 ---
chapter 5 “Modular Platforms Architecture”, an architecture approach was developed, based 

--- Document Chunk 4093 ---
on ERJU SP input and previous work package 26 work.  The modularization architecture – 

--- Document Chunk 4094 ---
how the modular approach is integrated into the architecture – and the service architecture 

--- Document Chunk 4095 ---
– how different internal and external interfaces are provided to functions and the outside – 

--- Document Chunk 4096 ---
are explained and are the basis for the detailed discussions later in the deliverable. 

--- Document Chunk 4097 ---
2) Requirements  

--- Document Chunk 4098 ---
For each of the MPC’s central ideas,  requirements were derived  and organized in the 

--- Document Chunk 4099 ---
appendices: Appendix B “HLPI Requirements ” lists the key learnings and rationales from 

--- Document Chunk 4100 ---
chapter 6, detailing the conditions for the broader virtualisation approach within the MPC. In 

--- Document Chunk 4101 ---
Appendix C “ ALPI Requirements”, the application level needs for defining interfaces I4 and 

--- Document Chunk 4102 ---
I5 are listed, based on the work presented in chapter 7. The remaining interfaces in scope of 

--- Document Chunk 4103 ---
the MPC are discussed in chapter 8 and the resulting requirements can be found in Appendix 

--- Document Chunk 4104 ---
D “Management, Diagnostics and Security related Interface Requirements”. The 

--- Document Chunk 4105 ---
requirements collected for th ree topics build a solid high -level starting point for further 

--- Document Chunk 4106 ---
consolidation and improvement, especially filling in gaps and checking and augmenting the 

--- Document Chunk 4107 ---
content by an implementation approach. 

--- Document Chunk 4108 ---
3) Approaches for Security  

--- Document Chunk 4109 ---
Security approaches are driven by the ERJU SP work as a framework, and also by concepts

--- Document Chunk 4115 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 4116 ---
on how to implement appropriate measures in the MPC, e.g. in chapter  6.8. Especially 

--- Document Chunk 4117 ---
enabling decoupled security driven updates is an inherent strength of the MPC. 

--- Document Chunk 4118 ---
4) Approaches for Safety  

--- Document Chunk 4119 ---
For the MPC goal to minimize the areas with functional safety integrity levels above Basic 

--- Document Chunk 4120 ---
Integrity while still providing an up to SIL4 capable environment two approaches have been 

--- Document Chunk 4121 ---
compared: HLPI and ALPI.  

--- Document Chunk 4122 ---
The HLPI safety discussion motivates certain measures that have to be implemented to 

--- Document Chunk 4123 ---
support the required safety capabilities in a virtualized environment, see chapter 6.7. The key 

--- Document Chunk 4124 ---
challenge is the decoupling or harmonization of the SRACs of the Safety Environment in the 

--- Document Chunk 4125 ---
AEE from the actual implementation  details of the CEE respectively CEME.  Proposals for 

--- Document Chunk 4126 ---
this challenge, like the motivation of the so -called “Native Hardware Access” (NHA) , have 

--- Document Chunk 4127 ---
been made and show potential ways forward.  

--- Document Chunk 4128 ---
For ALPI, the I5 interface presents an opportunity for decoupling Functional Applications with 

--- Document Chunk 4129 ---
SIL greater 0 from the underlying layers. The discussion can be found in chapter 7. 

--- Document Chunk 4130 ---
5) Sourcing of COTS components  

--- Document Chunk 4131 ---
The opportunities to source platform-defining components as COTS without the need to 

--- Document Chunk 4132 ---
develop new technologies or products is a clear advantage of the MPC.  As highlighted in 

--- Document Chunk 4133 ---
chapters 5.1.1 and 6, COTS hardware for the Physical Computing Environment can be used 

--- Document Chunk 4134 ---
in the MPC, as well as COTS virtualisation solutions can be used for the CEME.  The 

--- Document Chunk 4135 ---
adaptation of special properties or interfaces of the COTS components is achieved by 

--- Document Chunk 4136 ---
introducing the Platform Management (PM) component within MPC. The PM enables the 

--- Document Chunk 4137 ---
adaptation of ERJU-driven external interfaces (I1)  and Functional System specific internal 

--- Document Chunk 4138 ---
interfaces (see chapter 8) to the CEME. The CEME interfaces are depending on the COTS 

--- Document Chunk 4139 ---
solutions integrated into an actual Compatible Platform Implementation (CPI). With the PM, 

--- Document Chunk 4140 ---
all variants of CPI behave the same way externally and provide the same interfaces (I1). 

--- Document Chunk 4141 ---
Detailed technical analyses and further information including respective conclusions can be found in 

--- Document Chunk 4142 ---
the appropriate chapters. A comprehensive collection of open points is available in Appendix E. 

--- Document Chunk 4143 ---
In summary, this deliverable lays the foundation for the Modular Platform Concept, MPC, prominently 

--- Document Chunk 4144 ---
enabling capabilities such as  decoupled lifecycles of software and hardware  (MPC-P01), 

--- Document Chunk 4145 ---
consolidation of more software on less hardware  (MPC-P06), and extensibility (MPC-P04) in a 

--- Document Chunk 4146 ---
railway safety environment  using proven, commercial -off-the-shelf hardware and software 

--- Document Chunk 4147 ---
technologies. The COTS components are integrated using a n individual Platform Management 

--- Document Chunk 4148 ---
component, leaving room for innovation and differentiation of future Compatible Platform 

--- Document Chunk 4149 ---
Implementations. 

--- Document Chunk 4150 ---
The deliverable acts as an input to  current and future ERJU System Pillar activities, and to work 

--- Document Chunk 4151 ---
package 26 task 3, the study on modular certification . The deliverable concludes work package 26 

--- Document Chunk 4152 ---
task 2.

APPENDIX A MPC REQUIREMENTS 

--- Document Chunk 4264 ---
This chapter provides selected and adapted requirements from several sources as listed below, and potentially additional requ irements derived here 

--- Document Chunk 4265 ---
by the work package. The selection process focused on capturing a subset of important characteristics that differentiate the MPC from a traditional 

--- Document Chunk 4266 ---
railway computing platform. Not all sources previously mentioned (in chapter  4) have had requirements that were in suitable format or specificity to 

--- Document Chunk 4267 ---
allow their usage in the following list.

Table 9: Sources, Scope and Legend for the requirements table 

--- Document Chunk 4279 ---
The following notes capture relevant aspects of the methods applied when selecting and modifying the requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 4280 ---
Note 1: Most requirements in the following table have been modified where necessary to reflect the correct usage of the glossary term s from 

--- Document Chunk 4281 ---
chapter 3.7.2 – this is indicated by the usage of “#” next to the source identifier. Also, the system under consideration was changed to the 

--- Document Chunk 4282 ---
MPC (Modular Platform Concept) where needed. Some requirements were fully rewritten, as indicated by a “+” in the source field. 

--- Document Chunk 4283 ---
Note 2: Some requirements are only relevant when some form of application -level platform independence approach is chosen (on I4 respective I5 

--- Document Chunk 4284 ---
level as introduced in chapter 3.7.1). These requirements are prefixed with “Where application-level platform independence is used, …” to 

--- Document Chunk 4285 ---
indicate the relevant configuration.

The MPC shall provide safe and secure mechanisms to update Functional Systems as a whole or their selected individual

components locally and remotely. 

--- Document Chunk 4654 ---
Rationale: The ability of updating Functional Systems as a whole or some of their components is essential. To minimize 

--- Document Chunk 4655 ---
maintenance cost, the normal update deployment mechanism shall be remotely (e.g., over-the-air) with no 

--- Document Chunk 4656 ---
need for physical presence of any maintenance personnel on site (e.g., on the train). In case remote updates 

--- Document Chunk 4657 ---
fail for any reason, it must be possible to perform local updates with physical access to the MPC. Updates shall 

--- Document Chunk 4658 ---
be uploaded via industry standard interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 4659 ---
Remark: Software updates of the Functional System are performed by the platform, but software updates of entities

--- Document Chunk 4744 ---
Rationale: If a Functional System component is not able to conclude processing within a defined time period (once or
