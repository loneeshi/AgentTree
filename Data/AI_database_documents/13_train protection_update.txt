Back to basics: train protection

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
This, the fifth article on ‘back to basics’ 

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
themes, covers the subject of train 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
protection. The fundamental requirement 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
of a railway signalling system is to ensure a 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
train movement can be completed with the 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
minimum of risk from human error, while 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
at the same time allowing as many trains 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
as possible to run on a given infrastructure. 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
Much of the focus of a signalling engineer is 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
on the design of the infrastructure control 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
system that ensures safe routing of the trains 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
and supports the person responsible for 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
that activity, the signaller. But the other key 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
operative is the driver.

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
The history of railway signalling is very often about 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
the development of systems to prevent the wrong 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
signal being given to a driver and the evolution 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
of the technology that underpins that function. 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
Relatively little relates to supporting the driver, 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
although it would be wrong to assume there is 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
none. It is worth considering the different roles to 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
see if there is any underlying reason for this. The 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
signaller is dealing with a fixed set of equipment 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
that has a limited range of states and thus a limited 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
set of options. The requirement is to set specific 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
routes at given times to permit the safe passage of 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
a train, and to be reminded which of those actions 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
have yet to be completed. The driver on the other 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
hand is constantly making judgments about the 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
safe movement of the train based on information 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
from their own route and train performance 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
knowledge, signs at the trackside and the signals 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
seen. And in the case of signals seen these can 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
and often will be changing minute by minute as 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
other traffic moves. So the computational task of 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
assisting a driver is significantly more sophisticated 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
than that required to support a signaller. Maybe 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
this is why train protection systems seem to have 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
evolved more slowly, with the sophistication of 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
train protection requiring computing power akin 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
to a processor not a logic box.

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
Supporting the driver starts with providing clear 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
and concise signal indications so there is no 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
confusion in the meaning and limited opportunity 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
to read the wrong one. One can wonder how 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
drivers could see a dim oil lamp flickering behind 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
a coloured lens as they approached many of the 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
mechanical signals still in service, at least in the 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
UK until as little as 15 years ago. Many years ago, 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
drivers had the advantage of a dark sky with the 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
general absence of town and street lighting. Now 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
of course most signals are colour lamps but often 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
against a much brighter background. The problem 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
is how do we help the driver respond to those 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
signals and what other support do we need to give 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
them to limit the number of accidents. There are 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
two main errors a driver can make:

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
• Failure to control the speed of the 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
train correctly.

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
• Failure to stop at the defined End of 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
Authority (EoA).

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
It is these functions a train protection 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
system must address.

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
The remainder of this article will start by 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
examining the various types of train protection 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
and how those may affect the performance of the 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
railway. It will then provide a generalised review 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
of the development of systems to outline the key 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
requirements with examples of systems from the 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
UK and other countries.

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
Warning or protection

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
Within the overall scope of train protection there 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
are two main sub divisions, warning systems 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
and protection systems. A warning system will 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
normally be associated with the location at which 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
braking should commence whereas a protection 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
system will aim to stop the train at or soon after 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
the End of Authority (EoA). A warning system 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
will alert the driver to take note of information 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
presented from the trackside and may initiate 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
“The driver 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
is constantly 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
making 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
judgements 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
about the safe 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
movement of 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
their train”

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
braking action if the driver fails to acknowledge 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
the warning. After acknowledgement the train is 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
usually solely under driver control. A protection 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
system will enforce a brake application should 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
the system detect the train is being driven outside 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
safe parameters. There are several sub-divisions 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
of protection systems. It should be noted there is 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
overlap between some of these classifications.

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
Train stops

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
Probably the most basic but effective form of train 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
protection, train stops are typically mechanical 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
devices that trigger a brake application if passed 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
when in the ‘protecting’ position. They are 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
usually associated with a stop signal. A train stop 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
will ensure the train comes to a halt at braking 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
distance beyond. To be effective in eliminating 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
accidents they require an extended protected 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
length of track beyond the signal, which limits 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
application to lines with relatively low top speeds 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
(around 80km/h) and good brake performance 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
– typically metros. There are two fundamental 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
weaknesses with such systems; firstly, they 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
reduce capacity because the extended overrun 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
distance increases the headway between trains, 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
and secondly, they do not address the issue of 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
overspeed at other locations. There have been 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
applications where timed release of train stops is 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
used to monitor speed, especially approaching 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
buffer stops or high-risk junctions, but they are 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
difficult to implement successfully.

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
Intermittent train protection

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
Intermittent train protection is provided at those 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
locations assessed to pose significant risk. These 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
are usually junctions with substantial traffic or a 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
particular layout that creates additional risk, for 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
example where there is a chance of head-on 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
collision. As a train approaches such sites it passes 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
through a speed trap and if above a pre-set speed 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
will experience a forced brake application. 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
In more recent systems it will be fed information 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
about the current conditions and then calculates 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
the safe speed profile to be followed.

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
Modern systems of this type usually require 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
the fitment of an Automatic Train Protection 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
(ATP) system to the trains but avoid expensive 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
investment in a comprehensive trackside ATP 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
installation. Many of the systems introduced 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
prior to the turn of the century (2000) can be 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
considered to be of this form.

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
Train protection with intermittent update

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
These systems continuously monitor the 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
movement of the train to ensure it is within the 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
safe envelope. The driver is provided with an 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
indication of the current maximum safe speed but 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
otherwise drives to the signals and signs observed 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
at the trackside. The train picks up information 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
about the infrastructure ahead including the 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
traffic conditions at intermittent intervals, usually 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
from a balise or beacon or from inductive loops 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
laid in the track. The intermittent intervals are 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
usually associated with a signal, to facilitate the 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
inclusion of information about the extent of any 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
current movement authority and any speed limits 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
associated with that authority.

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
These systems provide full supervision of the 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
driver at all times and will intervene to reduce the 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
train speed back within the safe envelope prior to 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
returning control to the driver. The exception to 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
this is in the event of a Signal Passed at Danger 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
(SPAD) when a ‘trip’ state is entered and the 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
train is brought to a halt. The systems normally 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
include roll back protection, a function of most 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
ATP systems, to prevent the train rolling away 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
when brakes are released but traction power 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
is not applied.

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
Because the system only receives intermittent 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
updates, the system may restrict track capacity 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
because the train must be driven according to the 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
last update received and may thus continue to 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
enforce a reducing speed even though the signal 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
ahead has changed to a less restrictive aspect. A 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
means of partially overcoming this constraint is 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
to have ‘infill’ in the form of loops or additional 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
balises which augment the update frequency, 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
especially approaching critical signals.

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
One advantage of such ATP systems is, because 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
the train is being driven on conventional signals, 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
the system can be overlaid on the railway to 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
enhance safety. It is thus possible to partially 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
equip either or both track and trains with only 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
Supporting the driver 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
by relaying accurate 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
information in the cab and 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
reducing the possibility 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
of mistakes being made 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
has been a long running 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
focus of the command, 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
control and signalling 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
industry. The view may 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
have improved from the 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
steam era to the modern 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
day (as shown above) 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
but increased speed and 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
traffic complicates the 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
situation.

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
selected portions of the route and chosen trains 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
being protected. One disadvantage with this is 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
that an unfitted train which SPADS, may encroach 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
on the path of a fitted train, resulting in a serious 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
accident. Thus, this arrangement would ideally 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
only be used as a migratory configuration.

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
Train protection with continuous update

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
These systems have the facility to provide updated 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
movement authority information at any time. 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
Consequently, they are often part of an in-cab 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
signalling system because the driver is continually 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
fed information on the current safe speed and is 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
no longer required to watch for lineside signals 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
or signs. There may be other reasons, outside 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
the scope of the signalling system, for the driver 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
to watch the passing trackside and one of the 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
challenges is to ensure the right balance is struck 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
between watching the displays in the cab and 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
watching the line.

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
Another challenge with these systems is that the 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
driver is given advice on the safe speed profile 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
based on the train parameters encoded in the 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
system. If these parameters are wrong the driver 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
may be advised to brake later in the journey than 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
is desirable, with the risk of passing the End of 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
Authority (EoA) – the equivalent of a SPAD. This is 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
of particular concern for variable formation trains, 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
especially locomotive-hauled freight trains, but is 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
also relevant at times when adhesion is poor.

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
The major advantage of such systems is the ability 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
to enhance the capacity of the infrastructure. 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
Because the train and infrastructure are in regular 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
contact, and with a safe speed display in the cab, 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
the limitations of fixed lineside signalling with 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
a limited number of aspects can be removed. 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
Thus, a fixed block railway is no longer limited 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
to say four or five aspect signals, meaning closer 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
running is possible and, more importantly, 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
release of trains held at a converging junction 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
can happen significantly earlier with very short 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
block sections. This form of protection is a 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
corner stone of moving block systems and the 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
heart of Communication Based Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
(CBTC). Metro railways have been able to gain 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
significant uplift in service frequency as a result 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
of such application, for example the Victoria line 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
in London increased from around 30 to 36 trains 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
per hour in the peak as a result of implementing 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
CBTC. Continuous update train protection 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
thus offers enhanced performance and options 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
for reduced trackside equipment as well as 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
improved safety, making the business justification 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
measurably easier.

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
The advantages of in cab signalling and increased 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
capacity by removal of lineside signals usually 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
means either all trains must be fitted with a 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
suitable system or the configuration of existing 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
signals needs to be amended to allow changes 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
in operational rules. This poses a significant cost 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
hurdle before such benefits can be gained.

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
Warning systems

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
Warning systems are usually designed and 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
positioned to alert the driver to the presence of 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
a signal or sign at the trackside. The Automatic 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
Warning System (AWS) in the UK and used 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
elsewhere is a typical example. If a distant 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
signal is approached with a clear indication the 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
driver receives a bell (or gong) sound and is free 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
to continue. Should the signal be at caution 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
the sound is a buzzer (or horn) and the driver 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
must acknowledge this both to turn off the 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
sound and prevent a brake application. After 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
acknowledgement the driver is responsible for 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
the continued motion of the train. These basic 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
functions are almost identical to the French 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
“Crocodile” system.

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
It is interesting to note how the technology of 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
this system has changed. The basic system was 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
developed by the Great Western Railway, trialled 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
in 1906 and implemented shortly afterwards 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
across their network. Initially the communication 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
between track and train was a ramp in the track 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
with an electrical feed to indicate clear and no 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
electrical charge when at caution. This follows 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
the “fail safe” principle because the absence of 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
electricity could arise in several failure situations 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
whereas the mechanical lifting of the contact 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
shoe would fail much less often. The problem 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
with a mechanical contact system is wear and 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
tear especially as speed and frequency of use 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
increases as was inevitable when Multiple Aspect 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
Signalling (MAS) became common. The form of 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
AWS implemented by British Railways from the 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
1950s uses magnetic induction to convey the 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
signal status to the train. During the 1950s when 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
the system was being installed, semiconductor 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
devices were new so the equipment on the 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
train used relays. Today the logic is performed 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
by a PLC and the magnetic field detected by a 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
Hall Effect sensor.

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
AWS uses a permanent magnet centrally located 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
between the rails to initiate the onboard system 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
and provide the driver with a warning if the 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
signal is at caution or stop. An electromagnet 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
is positioned immediately afterwards where a 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
signal may show a line clear aspect. This second 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
magnet is energised when the signal is clear 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
(green) and effectively cancels the warning, 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
instead sounding a bell in the cab (see Figure 1). 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
The French “Crocodile” system conveys the two 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
messages from the infrastructure to the train by 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
different voltages applied to the “Crocodile” ramp 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
collected by a wire brush on the driving vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
mechanically contacting the ramp.

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
To ensure the two successive magnets are 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
detected at low speed the system delays output 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
to the driver for approximately one second after 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
passing the permanent magnet. This provides 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
time for a slowly moving train to detect the 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
electromagnet prior to initiating the warning 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
sequence. It then gives the driver around three 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
seconds to acknowledge a warning and observe 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
the signal. If no acknowledgement is received 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
the brakes will be applied. On passing the signal 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
displaying the caution aspect the train should 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
stop at or before the associated stop signal. Thus 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
the AWS trackside installation is placed around 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
4 seconds before the signal, which is normally 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
interpreted as about 180m.

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
A key technical challenge for AWS arose with its 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
application to third rail electrified infrastructure. 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---

--- Document Chunk 346 ---

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
Where high current DC traction systems are used 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
there is a risk of cross track cables creating ‘stray’ 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
magnet fields. In this case the AWS detectors on 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
the trains were desensitised and extra strength 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
magnets provided for the trackside AWS functions 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
to minimise the risk of false AWS information from 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
the stray fields.

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
Another challenge is the increasing use of bi-

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
directional signalling. With the magnets in the 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
centre of the track, trains in either direction will 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
detect the fields. Thus, trains passing over an 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
installation intended for the opposite direction of 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
movement will experience a warning since the 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
permanent magnet will be the last item passed. 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
On tracks where this is an infrequent occurrence 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
a sign may be installed to remind the driver this 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
warning does not apply to them. In locations 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
where such movement is more frequent or would 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
result in the need to regularly acknowledge 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
irrelevant AWS warnings, the permanent magnet 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
is surrounded by an electromagnet coil which 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
suppresses the permanent magnetic field when 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
a reverse direction movement is signalled. Thus, 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
outputs are required from the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
system not just to indicate when the signal is 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
showing a green aspect but also when a reverse 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
direction route is set. Occasionally the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
arrangement may enable one AWS installation 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
to be used for two signals reading in opposite 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
directions. In this case the permanent magnet 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
will have two electromagnets one either end 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
associated with the relevant signal.

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
Multiple aspect signalling has resulted in most 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
signals being equipped with AWS meaning the 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
need for driver acknowledgement can become 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
a semi-automatic reaction, especially when 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
operating a congested railway on restrictive 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
aspects. Indeed, this caused the Southern 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
Region of British Rail to experiment with a more 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
sophisticated form of Signal Repeating AWS 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
(SRAWS) during the early 1970’s but in the end 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
this was not adopted. The problem of instinctive 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
response is exacerbated by the application of the 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
system to severe permanent and all temporary 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
speed restrictions. These requirements arose after 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
accidents caused by excess speed. The need to 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
continue to reduce the harm caused by accidents 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
together with these human factor weaknesses 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
subsequently resulted in the development of the 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
Train Protection Warning System (TPWS).

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
A feature of AWS and many similar systems is 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
they give the driver one of two indications at 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
every signal. Thus, any failure of the train borne 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
equipment is quickly revealed to the driver and 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
can be managed through appropriate procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
In the case of AWS, the use of a permanent 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
magnet ensures that a complete failure of the 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
trackside installation is very remote and similarly 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
the driver will note a wrong indication. It should be 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
understood, AWS is not a fail-safe system with a 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
high SIL rating. It is therefore important that faults 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
are reported promptly and suitable measures 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
taken to operate safely after discovery.

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
Basic protection systems

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
The earliest protection systems were train stops 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
placed on the track at the location of a stop 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
signal, as previously described. When the signal 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
is showing a stop aspect an arm is raised typically 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
50-60mm above rail height. This engages with a 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
trip cock on the train which opens a vent on the 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
brake pipe forcing a brake application. The train 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
will be passing the signal at danger before the 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
brakes are applied in which context this is a SPAD 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
mitigation measure rather than prevention. When 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
the signal is clear the trip arm is lowered below 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
rail level. Train stops were normally provided 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
on metros operating in tunnels because of the 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
significant risk of a collision in such locations. 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
Extension to other locations has followed. To gain 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
full protection requires a long enough overrun 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
to bring the train to a halt from the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
attainable speed prior to the brake application. 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
For metros this is usually an associated design 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
constraint limiting capacity and creating some 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
operating constraints such as restricting speed 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
through closed stations when the overlap at the 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
next signal is based on the maximum attainable 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
speed from a standing start. For main line railways 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
the concept is often not practicable due to higher 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
speeds and extended braking distances.

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
“Another 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
challenge is the 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
increasing use 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
of bi-directional 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
signalling”

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
“Train stops are 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
measure rather

than a control

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
Train stops have moved on significantly from this 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
technology, but they are still a mitigation measure 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
rather than a control system. An early advance 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
on mechanical contact train stop systems was 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
“Indusi”, first installed in Germany and surrounding 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
countries in the 1930s and revived in the 1950s. 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
Several enhancements have subsequently 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
occurred leading to the system known as PZB90. 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
Three tones are generated on the driving vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
and interact with passive tuned coils mounted 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
as required trackside. The tuned coils cause 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
the relevant frequency on the motive unit to 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
resonate resulting in an impedance change and 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
thus activating the required action. The 2000Hz 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
tone is a train stop forcing a brake application 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
and is will typically resonate on passing a red 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
signal. The 1000Hz tone is typically associated 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
with a caution signal and requires a driver 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
acknowledgement followed by a speed reduction 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
within a set time whilst a 500Hz tone requires a 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
lower maximum speed and is often placed shortly 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
before a red signal. 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
Indusi tuned coils are installed on the sleeper 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
ends so they are naturally only detected by a 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
vehicle travelling in one direction and do not need 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
suppression for opposite-direction movements. 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
TPWS in the UK has related functionality in that 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
tones, in this case six of them around 65kHz, are 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
transmitted by track mounted loops this time 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
centrally mounted in the track. Three frequencies, 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
two arming and one trigger, are used for the 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
normal direction of movement and the other 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
three for trains in the opposite direction on bi-

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
directional track. These provide the functions 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
of a ‘speed trap’ for a train travelling faster than 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
deemed safe and a train stop (Figure 2). Should 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
either the speed trap or train stop function be 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
activated a full brake application is initiated and 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
maintained for one minute, bringing the train to 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
a stand. The location at which the train stops is 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
a function of the train brake performance and 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
the initial speed prior to the brake application. 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
There is no certainty this will be in a safe location. 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
TPWS is considered to have a high probability 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
of stopping a passenger train within the overlap 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
provided the approach speed is not greater than 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
75mph (120km/h) and adhesion can deliver the 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
braking effort of the train. Where approach speeds 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
are greater than 75mph and risk is assessed to be 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
high additional overspeed loops may be provided 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
earlier on approach to the signal (Figure 3 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
overleaf). The system substantially mitigates the 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
risk with a SPAD but does not eliminate it.

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
The speed trap function of TPWS is determined 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
jointly by the train and the infrastructure. The 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
train has a preset on board timer. At the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
the arming and trigger loops are separated by 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
a predetermined distance corresponding to 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
a defined speed based on the standard timer 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
setting. Current implementations assume two 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
standard timer settings, one for passenger trains 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
and a longer setting for freight trains. Thus, the 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
speed trap will activate if a train passes above a 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
predefined speed based on its ‘type’. This gives 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
rise to not infrequent cases where a marginal 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
overspeed results in a heavy brake application that 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
was probably ‘unnecessary’ in terms of the train 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
being able to stop where required. This can cause 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
drivers to dislike the system which is a concern as 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
it may lead to misuse.

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
TPWS is an intermittent train protection system 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
because it is only provided at locations that are 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
deemed high-risk. Those are defined as signals 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
protecting a convergent junction and selected 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
other signals (where the SPAD risk is assessed as 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
high), buffer stops and severe speed reductions 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
where the approach speed is or exceeds 60mph 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
(approximately 100km/h).

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
The TPWS system is active to stop a train so 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
a key requirement is confirming the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
equipment is functioning when required. This 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
is done by monitoring the current fed to the 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
transmitting loops. Should this fall outside the 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
intended parameters an indication is given to the 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
supervising signaller and the signal in rear held 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
at danger. Similarly, the on-board equipment is 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
self-diagnostic to confirm it is functional at the 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
start of a journey and in some cases intermittently 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
thereafter. As with AWS this system was not 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
designed in accordance with SIL 4 requirements, 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
so safety needs to be controlled by suitable 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
procedures in the event of a fault.

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
Neither PZB90 nor TPWS can prevent all accidents 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
as they are intermittent systems. Both systems 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
are provided with facilities to allow the driver to 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
reset the system after a brake intervention and 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
continue with the journey. Such reset is required 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
to be conducted under controlled circumstances 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
involving communication with the signaller or 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
a controller. In both cases there is evidence of 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
drivers sometimes resetting without following 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
the correct procedure, with the potential for a 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
serious accident.

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
Full ATP systems with  

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
intermittent update

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
Full ATP systems continuously monitor the 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
movement of the train and intervene with a brake 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
application should the speed go outside the safe 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
envelope. An indication of a suitable speed is given 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
to the driver, this speed usually having a small 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
margin beneath the safe speed envelope. These 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
systems are normally designed in accordance with 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
SIL 4 requirements.

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
To enable the train to continuously calculate 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
and monitor the safe speed profile information is 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
needed about several parameters:

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
• Infrastructure profile.

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
• Distance to the end of the movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
(i.e. stop signal) (EoA).

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
• Current speed of the train.

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
• Distance travelled.

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
• Braking performance of the train.

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
• Maximum train speed.

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
The infrastructure profile must reflect the 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
permitted speed, including any temporary speed 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
limits, covering at least the distance within the 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
current movement authority. This includes speed 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
limits over junctions which may vary depending 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
on the route allocated. It also needs to include 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
the gradient profile over the same distance as 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
changes to gradient can have a significant effect 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
on stopping distance.

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
The location of the EoA either needs to be known 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
or at least it is beyond the range that currently 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
needs to be considered (e.g. when driving on 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
green signals or the equivalent). To calculate the 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
ongoing speed profile, it is obviously necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
know the current speed and how far the train has 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
travelled to enable the remaining distance to any 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
speed change to be determined.

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
The braking performance of the train is a 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
key parameter in performing the safe speed 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
envelope calculation.

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
The data about the infrastructure including route 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
set and signal status is usually fed to the train 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
intermittently as data telegrams by balises or 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
beacons, most of which will be associated with 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
a signal (Figure 4). Some systems use inductive 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
loops laid in the track to pass the relevant 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
telegrams. Infill may be provided where the 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
intermittent transmission of data has a significant 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
impact on operational capability.

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
The need to know speed and distance travelled 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
results in some fairly complex configurations of 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
equipment on board the train. The wheel to rail 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
interface is notoriously challenging with relatively 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
low adhesion. This makes simple odometry 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
inadequate for the purposes of ATP especially as 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
the objective is a system with high safety integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
Slip (during acceleration) and slide (during braking) 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
are relatively likely, both creating erroneous 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
information if reliance is placed on wheel rotation. 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
Some systems use an unpowered and under 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
braked (or unbraked) axle as the sensor input.

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
Another risk with wheel rotation is the slow but 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
steady change in size as the wheel wears. Doppler 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
radar is sometimes used, but is not without 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
challenges especially in damp or snowy conditions 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
and of course like wheel rotation it is subject to a 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
steady build-up of position error unless corrected. 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
Use of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
offers another means. However, it rarely covers all 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
conditions, examples being tunnels and urban or 

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
other ‘canyons’ where lost or reflected signals can 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
affect the calculated position. Thus, odometry for 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
ATP is often a mix of systems to counteract the 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
weakness of any one of them and to support the 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
determination of the margin of error on the actual 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
estimated position which will tend to increase over 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
time and distance travelled. Balises or beacons 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
on the infrastructure are frequently used as a 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
reference point to correct accumulated error. Not 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
surprisingly odometry problems are potentially 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
the biggest cause of train equipment failure for 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
some ATP systems.

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
A further result of the challenge with odometry 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
is the need for a “release” speed with many ATP 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
systems. Because the train cannot know exactly 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
where it is the ATP system will assume worst 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
case error and therefore bring the train to a halt 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
a short distance prior to the current EoA. This is 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
a significant problem if the next update function 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
is located close to the EoA and in the case of the 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
EoA being at the end of a station platform when, 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
for station purposes, it is important to get close to 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
the platform end. To counteract these challenges, 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
it is normal for the ATP system to return full 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
control to the driver on final approach to the EoA 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
provided the train is then operated below a low 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
“release” speed. This of course means there needs 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
to be a short safe overrun beyond the EoA should 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
the train pass beyond the EoA, when a “trip” state 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
will be entered to bring the train to a stand.

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
Braking capability is the final parameter the system 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
needs. This is generally relatively simple for fixed 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
formation multiple unit trains, although a given 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
axle may under-perform due to a maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
issue. It is a far more complex challenge for 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
variable formation locomotive hauled trains, 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
especially freight trains. The usual arrangement 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
is to request the driver to enter or select brake 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
data as part of train preparation. One challenge 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
in defining the brake performance is whether the 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
system needs one or both the service brake and 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
emergency brake parameters, and ensuring the 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
rolling stock and signal engineer are discussing 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
the same function! The rolling stock engineer will 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
often regard the emergency brake as the brake 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
of last resort (i.e. a vented air pipe) which may 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
result in a lower deceleration rate because electric 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
braking and wheel slide prevention systems may 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
be disabled. If the emergency brake rate is lower 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
than the service brake rate it will tend to dominate 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
the operating profile because it will require the 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
train to be slowed earlier than the service brake. 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
Thus, it is important to be clear between parties 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
exactly what the parameters mean and how 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
they will be used.

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
The inputs from the above data sources are 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
typically fed to a multi-channel processing 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
system prior to being presented to the driver as a 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
permitted speed indication and when necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
the brake activation interface.

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
Full ATP systems with continuous 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
update

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
These systems have the same basic functionality 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
and challenges as described for intermittent 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
update systems, but the data about infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
condition is able to be updated at any time. Such 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
systems allow in cab signalling as the driver can be 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
informed of an update to signalling conditions via 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
the cab display.

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
Early systems achieved continuous update by 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
transmitting codes to the train via track circuits. 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
In practice the number of codes capable of 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
transmission this way is severely restricted. So

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
or gradient would have to be used as part of the 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
design process when configuring the system for 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
the railway. This method of providing continuous 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
update is limited to lines using rolling stock with 

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
very similar brake performance, or at least has to 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
be based on the worst brake performance train 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
permitted. It was the backbone of the original 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
London Underground Victoria Line automatic train 

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
operation system from 1965 until recently and is 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
the basis of the signalling on many of the French 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
LGV lines signalled using TVM 430. A significant 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
challenge with such systems is the need to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
the train can detect the track circuit code prior 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
to shorting the track circuit current as part of the 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
train detection role. Thus, assuming the detector is 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
at the front of the train, it is necessary for all track 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
circuit feeds to be ahead the train which means 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
that reversal of feed and detector functions is 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
necessary for any lengths of track used reversibly.

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
Another early method of providing continuous 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
update was via a loop usually between the rails 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
which radiates data to the train. The German LZB 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
system is perhaps the best known of this form and 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
is also the parent system for several others of this 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
type (e.g. SELTrac). In this particular case the data 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
rate is low by modern standards (1200 baud up 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
link to the train; 600 baud down link). Thus, the 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
data volumes handled between track and train 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
are relatively low (circa 85 bits per telegram). As 

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
a result much of the calculation is performed in 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
the LZB control centre and limited target speed 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
data is passed to the train. The loops in the four 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
foot are crossed every 100m which both reduces 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
interference and provides a distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
function to the train by reversing the phase of the 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
radiated signal.

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
The system is in relatively widespread use through 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
Germany and Spain, especially on high speed lines, 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
with other applications in Austria and elsewhere.

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
The most recent systems in this category are 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
urban CBTC train control systems and ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
Level 2 and above, both of which use radio 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
systems to transmit data between track and train.

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
The major advantage of mobile data packet 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
systems is the much larger and reliable data 

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
bandwidth, meaning more of the processing can 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
be performed on the train and be relevant to the 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
specific train, resulting in better optimisation. 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
They also both open the way for the train to 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
inform the infrastructure of its position and its 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
operating performance.

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
CBTC

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
Many current resignalling projects for metro 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
railways are based on Communications Based 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
Train Control (CBTC). As the title suggests this is 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
a highly integrated form of train control covering 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
all the important functions of train movement 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
including route setting, train location, movement 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
authority often based on moving block, train 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
supervision and train driving. In the latest systems 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
CBTC is often used on a railway working under 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
Automatic Train Operation (ATO) or a higher grade 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
of automation with the objective of providing the 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
maximum achievable capacity on the routes fitted.

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
CBTC systems incorporate continuous ATP 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
protection using radio communications between 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
the train and the trackside installation. The actual 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
form of the radio link, which is also used for other 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
aspects of the CBTC system, varies between 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
both supplier and application and may include 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE, although the majority of new 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
systems are likely to use 4G/LTE. The detailed 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
methods of implementation are proprietary to 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
the manufacturer.

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
Most systems of this type have been implemented 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
on individual lines of a metro or on people mover 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
systems (e.g. at airports). This has the advantage 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
of a limited range of rolling stock making the train 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
parameters consistent and thus maximising the 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
capacity gain from moving block.

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
Two disadvantages are the need, especially on a 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
high capacity metro, of having a highly reliable 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
system requiring layers of redundancy, and the 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
proprietary nature of the systems from each 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
manufacturer which for commercial reasons 

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
restricts the use of such systems on a large 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
network of lines.

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
ETCS

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
Until the around the 1990s most EU countries 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
had their own train protection systems as well as 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
signalling and communications arrangements. 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
This resulted in relatively closed markets for 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
signalling products and required different 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
systems to be available on any driving vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
that might cross from one country to another. 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
The advent of through international trains such 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
as Eurostar required the trains to be fitted with 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
multiple train protection and communication 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
systems and for the drivers to be trained in the 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
differing signalling arrangements. The opening 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
up of markets prompted the EU to propose a 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
common standard for rail traffic management 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
and especially signalling, train protection and 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
radio communications across the EU states which 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
culminated in the definition and development of 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
ERTMS including ETCS and GSM-R for track to 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
train communication.

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
ETCS provides three primary levels of 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
implementation together with others to suit 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
specific needs.

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
Level 1 is essentially an intermittent update ATP 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
system associated with existing lineside signals 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
with the same facilities and restrictions in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
‘infill’. The primary track to train communication 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
media is the balise with infill loops an option.

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
Level 2 adds a Radio Block Centre (RBC) and 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
provides continuous update of movement 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
authority and all associated infrastructure data by 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
radio. For ETCS the currently specified radio link 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
is via a continuously open GSM-R call. However, 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
this is likely to change as train radio moves to 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
packet switched (4G/LTE or 5G). In the interim 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
GSM-R may be supplemented with General 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
Packet Radio Service (GPRS), a 2/3G packet 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
oriented mobile data standard, to support ATP 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
in busy areas. It therefore has the functions of a 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
continuous update ATP system. Lineside signals 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
can be removed but Level 2 retains trackside 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
train detection and interlocking functions. Such a 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
system can provide the basis for Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
Operation (ATO) and has been implemented on 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
the Thameslink core through central London.

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
Level 3, which is not yet fully developed, will 

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
enable train detection to be based on data 

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
received by the RBC from the trains in the area. It 

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
will therefore facilitate the reduction or removal 

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
of lineside train detection equipment and facilitate 

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
the introduction of short virtual blocks or perhaps 

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
moving block. A significant challenge at present 

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
is from variable formation trains (e.g. freight and 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
locomotive hauled passenger trains) and proving 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
they are complete at all times.

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
Other ETCS levels also exist, including those 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
working with a national ATP system through a 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
Specific Transmission Module (Level STM), and 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
Level 0 when an equipped train is operating over 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
unfitted infrastructure and is thus subject only to 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
train ceiling speed supervision.

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
In addition to these primary levels there also exist 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
options for Limited Supervision which effectively 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
provides train protection only at critical locations 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
and thus corresponds to intermittent train 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
protection. Finally, there are proposals for ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
Hybrid Level 3 which provides virtual blocks as 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
well as conventional train detection, delivering 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
capacity benefits for trains that are Level 3 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
enabled, without having to bar the route to Level 2 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
or unfitted trains. An article about ETCS Level 3 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
and Hybrid Level 3 was published in the April 2017 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
issue of IRSE News.

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
Positive Train Control (PTC)

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
In North America there is currently a programme 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
to implement Positive Train Control (PTC) on 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
all intercity passenger lines, and on freight lines 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
carrying more than 5 million tons per annum 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
of inhalable toxic substances. PTC is a form of 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
ATP in that it requires the prevention of collision 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
due to passing the end of authority or passing 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
through misaligned points and speed supervision 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
to prevent derailment at speed restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
whether permanent or temporary. There is no one 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
mandated solution but there is the requirement of 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
interoperability between systems as many vehicles 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
travel over several networks. It also requires 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
provision of arrangements to protect track 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
workers. Whilst several systems were proposed 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
most installations have settled on one of three 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
systems and all will operate with each other.

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
China’s CTCS system 

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
shares many concepts 

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
with ETCS but has 

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---
developed very quickly 

--- Document Chunk 1032 ---
in order to keep up 

--- Document Chunk 1033 ---
with infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1034 ---
developments across the 

--- Document Chunk 1035 ---
country.

About the author ...

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
David joined the S &T department of the 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
Southern Region of British Rail in 1968 as a 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
student engineer, with his first appointment 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
in the telecommunication design office. He 

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
supported the testing and commissioning of 

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
passenger information systems, including the 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
automatic operation of platform indicators at 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
London Bridge and Waterloo East and setting 

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---
a career profile linked with development 

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
of new systems.

--- Document Chunk 1060 ---
In the 1980s David led a team involved with 

--- Document Chunk 1061 ---
train describer development and a new system 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
to distribute train location information via 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
the national teleprinter network, followed by 

--- Document Chunk 1064 ---
the development of the Integrated Electronic 

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
Control Centre (IECC) including automatic 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
route setting. He was also involved in improving 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
electromagnetic compatibility between train 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
detection and new rolling stock.

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
Moving to Railtrack in 1994 he was involved 

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
with the development and implementation 

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
of TPWS and the development of ERTMS in 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
Europe, his work including the implementation 

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
strategy for the UK. Before retirement David 

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
managed the safety assurance process for the 

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
Cambrian ERTMS pilot. David is one of the

that underpin our profession into focus in a 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---

to those of you who are new to the industry 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
and are working to build up your knowledge. 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
For those considering taking the IRSE exam, 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
these articles should be particularly relevant 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
for your studies.

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
As an example, why not think about how you

would answer this question from the 2019  

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
Module 5 of the exam, based on what you’ve

The PTC system was mandated by law signed in 

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
2008. The original law required the system(s) to 

--- Document Chunk 1111 ---
be in place by 2015 but costs and challenges in 

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
implementation mean this date has been pushed 

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
back to the end of 2020. The range of operating 

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
conditions from metro and commuter railways 

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
to long heavy haul freight lines means variety of 

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
solutions is too great to discuss here and could 

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
well be the subject of a separate article.

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
In a similar way that CTCS 

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
was created to meet the 

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
needs of China, PTC was 

--- Document Chunk 1121 ---
developed to meet the 

--- Document Chunk 1122 ---
specific needs of North 

--- Document Chunk 1123 ---
America’s railroads. Union 

--- Document Chunk 1124 ---
