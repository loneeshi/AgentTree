Back to basics: Level crossings

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
In this, our latest, “back to basics” article we 

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
look at how signal and telecoms engineers 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
have to consider more than just the 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
movement of trains around the network. 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
The article makes reference to factors which 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
should be considered in the provision and 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
operation of level crossings, although legal 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
and cultural differences prevail in many 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
countries which may override the generic 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
principles set out in this article. 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
Why do we need level crossings?

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
In some countries the railway came before roads 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
while in others the construction of the railway 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
divided land and roads where other rights had 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
been established. Either way, it created the 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
need for road and rail to cross each other. Level 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
crossings vary considerably in type, often on the 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
same railway, but members of the public may not 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
appreciate the differences in operation as they 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
just require a place to cross the railway safely if a 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
bridge or underpass cannot be provided. 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
Terminology

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
There are many different terms used to describe 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
features of a level crossing around the world. 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
Table 1 lists some terms associated with level 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
crossings along with a description. Throughout 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
this article we shall refer to ‘level crossings’, but 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
they are also known as ‘grade’ crossings and ‘rail’ 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
or ‘railroad’ crossings.

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
What is a level crossing? 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
So having determined the need to cross the 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
railway on the level we can start to define this 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
as a ‘level’ crossing. The form of this crossing 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
may involve simply designating a place using 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
signs, for example, where visibility is good to see 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
trains approaching. Railways in many countries 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
do not have continuous boundary fences, so it is 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
important to designate safe places to cross the 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
tracks. Although not usually part of the signal 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
engineer’s responsibility, the levelling up of the 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
ground from the railway boundaries up to and in 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
between the rails gives strength to the definition 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
Road crossing application 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
and technology varies 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
enormously around the 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
world. This is one of 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
several different types of 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
half barrier crossing in the 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
UK. Half barrier crossings 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
are less expensive than 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
full barrier crossings 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
and prevent users being 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
trapped inside the 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
barriers. However there 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
is a risk of crossing users 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
‘weaving around’ the 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
closed half barriers. 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
of ‘level crossing’. By contrast many footpath 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
crossings do not have a built‑up deck, relying 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
instead on users to step over the rails. Vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
crossings mostly need a deck to reduce the risk of 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
vehicles getting stranded. The design of the deck 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
will be informed by the types of vehicle or traffic 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
using it, especially the vertical curvature or hump 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
which could lead to vehicles becoming stranded 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
where the body of the vehicle between axles 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
comes into contact with the crossing surface (that 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
is, becomes grounded). 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
What does the law say?

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
Some countries insist on measures to manage 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
risk of collision with a train, leaving the specific 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
arrangements for the level crossing designer 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
to decide based on risk. Others prescribe 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
arrangements in detail; often a blend of these 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
regulations will apply. In some countries it is 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
the policy of the railway companies not to 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
provide equipment unless required to do so by a 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
government entity, as litigation may result where 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
other similar crossings are not so equipped if there 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
was an accident. 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
In some cases, the costs of provision and 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
maintenance of a crossing fall on the railway 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
authority, sometimes the government or other 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
public body will require actions and fund those, 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
in other cases costs may fall to the private 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
user or be shared. 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
In some countries there are many different parts 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
of law which can apply, especially where highways 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
and road traffic is involved. Often different laws 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
will apply for pedestrian crossings or for crossings 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
between privately owned land such as farmers’ 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
fields or access to a single house.

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
Safety

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
Accident statistics demonstrate that level crossings 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
are high risk sites for railway operators as well as 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
contributing to large numbers of near‑ miss events. 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
The reasons for this high level of risk should be 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
obvious to railway professionals who are familiar 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
with recognising hazards, but level crossing users 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
come from a broad spectrum of society who 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
may not be familiar with the characteristics of a 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
train operations, where long stopping distances 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
are normal, and trains are unable to deviate from 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
the line of travel. Monitoring of crossing use is 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
important as patterns of use (and therefore levels 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
of risk) can change significantly over time. In 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
recent years, for instance, there have been major 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
changes of traffic pattern in some areas due to 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
the use of satellite navigation devices and the 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
popularity of home delivery courier services.  

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
Selection of system

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
Where the law requires protection or warning 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
systems to be provided, or the railway or other 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
authority chooses to fund provision of equipment 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
for their benefit or the benefit of the public, care 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
should be taken in choosing the right combination 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
of equipment to be safe and effective. Increasingly, 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
convenience is being recognised as an important 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
factor in system selection. Delaying users or 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
trains has consequences, such as cost penalties 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
either directly or in productivity loss and can 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
lead to frustration which may result in users 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
circumventing warnings.

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
Some railways have risk modelling tools to help 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
choose equipment configurations that give the 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
most effective risk reduction. Such tools also 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
help to support a financial case for investment 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
Active warning Warning or protection devices for road users which are activated by a train 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
or railway staff.

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
Deck The support and surface area of a crossing which carries users and/or 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
their vehicles.

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
Full barrier crossing A crossing fully fenced between road and railway when the road is closed. 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
May use a single boom on each side or two half booms or equivalent 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
equipment, e.g. gates. 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
Grounding A vehicle stranded by coming into contact with the crossing surface/deck. 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
Occurs when a long wheelbase vehicle traverses a crossing with a severe 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
vertical curve or hump. This is often denoted by the sign on the left.

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
Half barrier A crossing with a barrier closing the entrance lane(s) of each 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
carriageway only.  

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
Humped The vertical profile of a crossing where it rises in the centre – see 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
also ‘grounding’.

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
Level Crossing A designated place where the public can cross the railway safely on the level. 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
May also be known as a grade crossing, rail crossing or railroad crossing. It 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
may include a sign or other equipment to assist the user. 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
Passive crossing A crossing where the user is responsible for assuring their own safety by 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
checking for the approach of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
Protecting signal A railway signal used to authorise train movements over a level crossing.

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
Saltire St Andrews Cross or Crossbuck, commonly used to signify the presence of a 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
railway crossing. This is shown to the left.

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
Wig‑W ag or 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
flashing light signal

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
A road traffic light signal with twin flashing red lights to warn road users 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
of the approach of a train. May be used alone or in combination with 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
barriers or gates.

in risk reduction and may include benefits to 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
society through a reduction in lives lost or 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
injuries incurred. 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
A key input to the selection process is 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
understanding the use of a crossing both by 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
the railway and by users. A census of use taken 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
over several days is helpful to identify all of the 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
different types and numbers of users, and their 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
characteristics. It is important to understand 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
how long they take to traverse the crossing 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
and whether users can pass safely if they meet 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
on the crossing. What are the approaches like, 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
can vehicles stop easily? Do vehicles approach 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
at speed, or is there a likelihood of becoming 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
stranded on the railway? 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
On the railway how many tracks are there? Do all 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
trains pass through at line speed or are there some 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
trains passing at slower speeds? Is there a station 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
or junction nearby which affects speeds? Do 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
trains pass in the area or closely follow each other 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
and therefore keep the crossing closed for long 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
periods? Can visibility of approaching trains and 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
therefore warning time be improved by removal of 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
lineside vegetation? 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
Pedestrian user characteristics may include 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
mobility, hearing or sight impaired people; people 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
with luggage, pushing cycles, or children/young 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
adults or those with cognitive impairment who 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
are less risk aware. Distraction factors such as 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
mobile devices or moving in groups should also 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
be considered. 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
When level crossings are renewed these factors 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
may have changed considerably so it is vital that a 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
thorough assessment is made whenever a change 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
is proposed to a crossing.

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
Historically many crossings were operated by 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
railway staff. Automation is now common on 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
some railways which makes crossings cheaper to 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
operate and manage but this relies on increased 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
knowledge and discipline on the part of users. 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
Understanding human behaviour factors and the 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
interpretation of warnings is a necessary part of 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
selecting the best combination of equipment 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
to assist users.

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
Some railways have dedicated level crossings 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
specialists while in others it is a general signal 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
engineering responsibility. Level crossing 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
management extends to engaging with users 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
to educate them how to use level crossings 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
safely, especially when changes are proposed 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
or implemented. This may be through school 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
visits, media campaigns or local meetings with 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
individuals or groups. 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
Proposals to change a crossing or sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
to renew it, may require consultation with 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
stakeholders who have an interest. Typically, 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
people representing interested groups such 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
as the traffic authority, disability groups, the 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
emergency services, planning authorities, or 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
political representatives may contribute to these 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
consultations and expect their views to be taken 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
into account. Consultees may express views about 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
safety, convenience, appearance, noise, lighting, 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
accessibility, disruption during work, to list just 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
some of the factors.

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
Technical protection or  

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
warning systems

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
The level crossings engineer has a lot of 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
equipment available which can be configured to 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
provide an appropriate solution. At the simpler 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
end there are warning signs, or instructional 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
signs. At the complex end there are complete 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
barrier installations with sophisticated obstruction 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
detection devices, which can identify people or 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
objects on the crossing. These should have a 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
high reliability and assurance of safe operation 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
which allows them to automatically confirm the 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
crossing is clear. 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
Crossings may have gates or barriers. These are 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
operated either by the railway or by the road user. 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
The road may have lights, usually twin flashing 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
red, which are accepted as an absolute stop 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
An unprotected crossing 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
in Chile. The safety of 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
road user and the railway 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
is very much dependent 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
on the signs being 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
obeyed.

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
“Some railways 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
signal, even by emergency services. Sounders 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
may be provided to reinforce a warning and to 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
assist vision‑impaired users. The use of surface 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
markings on a road or path to identify the safe 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
place to stop is another feature along with signs 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
and other carriageway markings to help the user 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
navigate a crossing. Where railway signals are 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
provided, they may be controlled to only allow 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
trains to proceed when the crossing is closed and 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
clear; they may also be interlocked to prevent the 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
crossing being opened for road users once a train 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
has been signalled until it has passed through or 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
safely stopped. 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
In some countries telephones are provided at 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
some types of crossings to enable members of 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
the public to seek permission to use a crossing. 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
These are normally provided where the warning 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
time obtained by visual means is less than the 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
time needed to cross safely, and no other active 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
protection or visible warning is provided. The 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
telephones need to be protected from water 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
ingress, vandal damage and located in a position 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
of safety and with clear instructions on their use 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
to cross safely. The telephones are normally 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
‘direct lines’ to the controlling signaller. The 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
signaller must only be able to talk to one crossing 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
at any one time, and the crossing name must 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
be displayed to the signaller throughout the 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
call. There must be no overhearing, so that one 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
crossing user cannot hear instructions intended 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
for another crossing and the voice quality must 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
provide clear communication. The identity and 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
location of the crossing from which the call 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
is being made must be clearly and accurately 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
displayed to the signaller. 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
There are number of problems with telephone 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
crossings. The signaller may not have an accurate 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
knowledge of where trains are in relation to the 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
crossing. This can lead to misunderstanding of 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
messages and increases the workload for the 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
signaller. Signallers are trained to use ‘safety critical 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
communications’ protocols but communicating 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
with the public requires an additional skill set. The 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
crossing user may not bother to use the telephone 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
or may misunderstand the message being given 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
and cross with a train approaching. With signal 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
control areas getting larger and potentially 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
more telephone crossings per signaller the risks 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
become even greater. 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
At some types of automatic crossing telephones 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
are provided for users to alert the signaller if the 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
crossing becomes occupied with a failed road 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
vehicle. In such situations the telephone is the 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
only way of protecting the crossing from an 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
approaching train, assuming there is a protecting 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
signal in the right place, or an emergency radio 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
call can be made to the approaching train with 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
time to stop. Such telephones must operate at all 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
times and self‑reporting fault monitoring can be 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
provided to check the telephone is working.

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
Where a crossing is supervised the signaller may 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
confirm the crossing is safe to allow trains to 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
proceed by direct observation from the signal box 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
or Closed‑Cir cuit Television (CCTV) from a remote 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
location. A crossing attendant may be employed 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
to operate barriers or gates; this person would be 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
provided with an indicator or other information to 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
advise when a train is expected. 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
Automatic crossings may not have signals 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
interlocked with the crossing and instead rely on 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
highly dependable safety features to ensure the 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
crossing operates for each train. It is important 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
that when a crossing operates there is not too 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
much time before a train arrives, or an inconsistent 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
time between the arrival of trains, which might 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
otherwise encourage poor discipline by users 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
who may attempt to circumvent the protection or 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
ignore the warning. 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
Automatic crossings are activated by the approach 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
of a train and rely on train detection equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
treadle, track circuit, axle counter or prediction 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
device placed an appropriate distance from the 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
crossing to guarantee timely operation. A crossing 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
control device may be configured to deal with 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
trains approaching from more than one direction. 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
“In some 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
countries 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
telephones 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
are provided

at some types 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
of crossings to 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
enable members 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
of the public to 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
seek permission

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
Sometimes automatic crossings are provided 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
with an escape route or clear exit to avoid users 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
being trapped if the crossing operates when they 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
are part way across. Unfortunately this leaves an 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
opportunity for malicious or unsuspecting users 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
to enter the crossing from the opposite direction 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
when a train is approaching. 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
On some lines it can be useful for train crew to 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
operate a crossing, typically where line speed 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
is low and only infrequent and less time‑critical 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
services operate. This introduces additional 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
hazards, similar to where a signaller has to push 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
gates across a road; this is really only suitable 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
where road speeds are low and traffic infrequent. 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
Train drivers may also be required to observe a 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
crossing is clear after it has activated automatically 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
but before passing over it. This is only practical 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
where train speed is low and there is good visibility 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
approaching the crossing, allowing them time to 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
stop short if there is an obstruction.

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
In-cab signalling

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
Systems such as the European Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
System (ETCS) in‑cab signalling presents both 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
opportunities and challenges for the operation 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
and management of level crossings. 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
Above, open crossing with 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
lights in New Zealand.

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
Right, a pedestrian 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
crossing in Melbourne, 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
Australia.

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
Initially ETCS was only planned for high‑speed 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
lines where level crossings do not exist. As the 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
use of ETCS has become more widespread, 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
lines which have quite high populations of level 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
crossings have been fitted. One feature of level

crossing operation is the critical timing required. 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
As ETCS transmits a movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
to the train and the train reports its position 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
there can be a small delay or even a loss of 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
transmission in a message. 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
While this can be accommodated in the course 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
of normal train movement it becomes important 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
where reporting the position of a moving train in 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
relation to a crossing is concerned. A slight delay 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
in triggering an automatic crossing could result in 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
the crossing not being closed for sufficient time 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
before the arrival of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
Restrictions of speed can be embedded in the 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
permitted speed profile to ensure that where users 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
need a given number of seconds clear sight of an 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
approaching train in order to cross safely this can 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
be enforced precisely and cost effectively without 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
additional line‑side infrastructure.

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
“On some lines 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
it can be useful 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
for train crew 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
to operate a 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
crossing”

Automatic train operation

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
Automatic train operation is commonly associated 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
with metros and other high density urban railways 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
which do not have level crossings. Some heavy 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
haul freight railways now use automatic operation 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
of their trains over long distances. With remote 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
management of the operation and driverless trains 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
it is important that level crossing use does not 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
impact the safety of the rail operation. Automatic 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
operation of the level crossings is preferred. This 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
is achieved, in some railways, through the use of 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
predictor technology which allows for adequate 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
warning times for road users and also ensures 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
that the level crossing is open long enough for 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
road users to clear the crossing once they have 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
committed to crossing it. Obstacle detection 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
equipment is used to identify any problem with 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
the level crossing and in particular where road 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
and rail intersect, which informs the train control 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
system and revokes the movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
through an emergency brake application. Where 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
braking distances may be 2km or more advance 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
notice of any problem is essential to manage the 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
train to avoid a conflict. The ability to stop a train 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
before a level crossing needs to occur outside 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
the minimum stopping distance. Anything less 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
than that is a situation that raises the likelihood 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
of a collision. 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
Future opportunities

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
Any prediction of the future will almost certainly 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
prove to be wrong. However, there are a few 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
foreseeable developments which will impact 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
the future of level crossings. The introduction of 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
Future Railway Communications System (FRMCS) 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
may allow more use of wireless technology in 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
the control and operation of crossings, with 5G 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
likely to be used both for FRMCS and autonomous 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
vehicle operation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
be harnessed to allow learning from current 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
operations and to improve our understanding of 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
user behaviours. The use of AI derived solutions 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
could prove challenging to safety validate. 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
Self‑driving autonomous vehicles may have 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
a significant impact on safety improvement 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
where messages transmitted from the crossing 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
may give advance notice to the road vehicle of 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
the imminent operation of a crossing, possibly 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
enforcing a controlled brake application. Radio 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
communications could also be used to alert an 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
approaching train if the crossing is occupied. 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
These developments could reduce or eliminate 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
human error or misunderstanding which 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
contributes to many level crossing incidents.

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
“Any prediction 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
of the future  

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
will almost 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
certainly prove 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
to be wrong”
