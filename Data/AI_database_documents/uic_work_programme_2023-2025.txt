--- Document Chunk 12 ---
However, we also need to show the potential of rail 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
ready to compete with other modes of transport. 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
There is a lot of work ahead of us to release full 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
railway potential. We need to improve our cost 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
effectiveness through digitalisation and innovation, 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
resolve problems with interoperability and capacity 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
constraints, and most of all we need to invest in 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
modern infrastructure and rolling stock. 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
Rail must play a leading role in the decarbonisation 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
of transport sector at global and regional scale. It’s 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
the most and the only sustainable mass transport 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
that is currently ready to address our climate 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
related challenges effectively. Therefore, it needs 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
to be placed right at the heart of development of 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
future mobility and global logistics chains. 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
In order to make it happen, the railway community 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
needs to intensify its efforts to further promote the 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
clear advantages of rail through public discourse 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
and make it more attractive and competitive in 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
both the eyes of present and potential users as 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
well as all decision-makers. 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
We want more people to travel by train, more 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
companies to move their goods by rail and more 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
people to consider a career in the industry. 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
“THE NEEDS OF THE 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
REGION’S MEMBERS [...] 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
REMAIN MY ABSOLUTE 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
PRIORITY.”

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
As Chairman of the UIC, I am committed to work 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
with our European members and other world 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
regions to ensure that rail plays and will play an 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
important global role in securing transport sector 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
sustainability and in achieving the abovementioned 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
climate and environmental goals. 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
Therefore, the supra-regional development of 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
railways has special meaning and importance to me. 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
It not only allows for tackling climate challenges 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
globally, hence contributing to a brighter future for 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
all the world’s societies and our planet, but also, if 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
well managed and adequately financed, railways 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
can become an important element of social policy 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
– an effective tool to increase citizens’ mobility, 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
eliminate various types of social exclusion, and 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
facilitate access to the labour market and public 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
services. 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
Railway needs a realistic vision supported by 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
effective tools for its delivery. Whether it is creation 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
of a coherent global rail network with seamless 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
goods and passenger flow through its corridors, 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
further digitalisation and standardisation, or fast 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
and efficient modernisation through innovative 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
solutions, UIC is the optimal cooperation platform 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
for sharing global ideas and developing common 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
tools to make it all real. 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
Rest assured that the needs of the region’s 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
members and development of interregional 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
cooperation remain my absolute priority and I 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
am deeply convinced that our new UIC Work 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
Programme 2023-2025 will play a crucial role in 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
releasing development and innovative potential of 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
the railway sector on a global scale.

FRANÇOIS DAVENNE,  

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
UIC DIRECTOR GENERAL

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
The International Energy Agency analysis shows that traffic 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
must shift from road and aviation to rail this decade in order 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
to reach the Paris Agreement objectives. Despite stagnating 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
at around 8%, rail’s market share needs to grow by more than 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
40% in less than a decade.

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
The railway sector is entering a crisis and emergency period.

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
A crisis period, because the challenges we have had to fight 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
over the last three years with the Covid pandemic, followed by 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
the Ukrainian crisis, which in turn has highlighted the fragility 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
of energy supply chains, have shown that the assets we may 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
have thought impossible to call into question are fragile. It will 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
therefore be necessary in the future to think in an uncertain 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
universe and to be ready to help our members in the resolution 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
of unexpected crises.

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
An emergency period because we know that the climate 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
issue is urgent. The IPCC report

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
1 of April 2022 tells us that we 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
need to implement a clear break with the practices and habits 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
of the transport sector if we want to achieve the objectives of 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
the Paris Agreement

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
2. We only need to look at the gradient 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
of the curve that is compatible with the Paris Agreement 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
1.5° objective: it requires an inflection so rapid that it is only 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
compatible with a strong acceleration of the modal shift 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
towards rail transport, public transport and active mobility.

Policy assessments for 2030:

NDCs prior to COP26, 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
unconditional elements  

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
88

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
Projected global GHG emissions from NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
warming will exceed 1.5°C and also make it harder after 2030 to limit waming to below 2°C.

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
7

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
The combination of these two constraints means we must 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
succeed and succeed quickly.

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
In the next three years, the European Union has taken a strong 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
initiative in favour of the railway mode with the creation of 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
Europe’s Rail

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
3. 1.2 billion euros will be spent over the next seven 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
years to rapidly advance the sector to meet the challenges it 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
faces. Obviously, the objective of modal shift must begin to 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
be pursued resolutely without waiting for the implementation 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
of these technical breakthroughs, which for the most part 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
will not arrive until 2030. However, these innovations must be 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
part of the roadmap that we must draw together.

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
From the UIC’s point of view, we must therefore proceed with 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
a dual alignment.

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
From a technical point of view, the ERJU (Europe’s Rail 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
Joint Undertaking) roadmap must serve as a reference 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
point for projects developed within UIC, while preserving 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
the association’s ability to operate on an international level. 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
It is therefore not a question of limiting ourselves to the 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
developments that are underway within ERJU, but of making 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
it an anchoring point to continue to focus UIC’s activity on 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
subjects that have a strong added value for our members. 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
Throughout this Work Programme 2023-2025 we will use the 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
following typology:

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
f Projects that are within the scope of ERJU and for

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
which UIC support is necessary, such as FRMCS (Future

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
Railway Mobile Communication System) and DAC (Digital

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
Automatic Coupling).

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
f Projects outside the scope, but which are necessary to

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
develop a rail offer for a new transport paradigm, such as

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
OSDM (Open Sales and Distribution Model) and the digital

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
platform for freight.

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
f Regional work programmes that will allow the deployment

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
of structured training actions, the study of use cases

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
adapted to local contexts and the dissemination of

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
innovations conducted by UIC all over the world.

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
3. rail-research.europa.eu/about-europes-rail/

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
From the point of view of sector advocacy , the Manifesto 4 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
that we adopted in July 2022 will be the basis for the future 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
UIC action plan. The document deliberately calls for a global 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
paradigm shift, with the collaboration of all transport modes, 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
to put energy efficiency at the heart of transport policies. 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
Over the next three years, we will need to unite our energies 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
to create a global coalition where we can work with rail 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
operators and manufacturers, public transport operators, road 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
transport operators and associations to design a concrete 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
path to a desirable frugal future.

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
The ability to finance this shift will also be a new priority for 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
UIC. We are faced with a new challenge: the decarbonisation 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
of the transport sector can only be achieved through massive 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
investment in infrastructure and rolling stock to develop the 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
modal share of rail. This investment will of course have to 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
come from public authorities, but also from the private sector. 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
In particular, it will be necessary to progressively make people 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
accept the need, at both the European and global levels, that 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
climate finance, carbon offsets, as well as a significant part 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
of the carbon tax, must be reinvested in the realisation of the 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
necessary capacity to carry out a new transport paradigm 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
around rail and public transport.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
UIC is entering the second phase of development 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
of its strategic objectives. The 100 th General 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
Assembly did not wish to change the five key 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
focus areas, considering that they had given the 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
Association a positive general orientation and 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
generated concrete developments. Moreover, 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
even if substantial progress has been made in 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
positioning UIC as the technical organisation of 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
reference for the railway sector, much remains to 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
be done, in particular to strengthen UIC’s position 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
in Europe, while giving real scope to regional 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
activities.

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
The updated strategic objectives reflect this 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
ambition.

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
UIC published its “Vision of Rail 2030 – 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
Design 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
a better future ”5 on December 2021: adaptation 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
to climate change is becoming a major concern, 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
shared worldwide, and the urgency of which has 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
just been recalled by the IPCC

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
6. All the Multilateral 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
Development and investment banks, including the 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
As a result, UIC will notably encourage, through 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
its “Vision of Rail 2030” and the “More Trains” 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
campaign, the allocation of funds to invest in the 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
improvements of multimodality, infrastructure, 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
rolling stock and services , as well as innovation 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
to decarbonise operations, in order to drastically 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
increase the number of trains, the number of 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
passengers and freight carried worldwide.

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
Furthermore, UIC will develop railway training 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
courses linked to its strategic areas in order to 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
support its members in all regions. 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
There is a need to rethink learning strategies to 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
develop the skills of staff and to attract the talent 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
of the future. A flexible, well-trained and motivated 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
workforce is key to a competitive and innovative 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
sector.

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
To this end, several types of training will be proposed 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
with the establishment of a UIC Rail Academy 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
distance learning platform in partnership with a 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
recognised academic institution. This objective 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
is to quickly offer the rail sector an express route 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
to upskill staff, enabling them to confidently face 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
the challenges ahead. In this way, UIC wishes to 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
extend the rail sector’s capacity for innovation and 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
improve the sector’s competitiveness by making 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
full use of the knowhow of its rail experts. UIC will 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
go on supporting regional training centres and 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
create synergies between them in order to meet 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
the specific needs of members in the regions within 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
a common framework.

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
Finally, the Talent and Expertise Development 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
Platform will see its organisation change in 2023 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
in order to address the new challenges and 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
solutions for learning, development and training 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
technologies.

SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDISATION

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
During its 100 years of productivity, UIC 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
produced a valuable asset of technical 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
specifications and guidelines for the 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
railway community. 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
Accessing this legacy and participating 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
in the new developments are the main 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
interest when engaging with UIC. In this 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
context clarifying the exact role of UIC 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
is paramount for each of the regional 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
strategies. 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
It can be summarised in the following 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
“V-cycle” diagram, which is quite classic 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
in the manufacturing world. Thus, UIC is 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
present:

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
 f Upstream, at the inception of the 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
concept of operations and the defi -

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
nition of requirements (functional or 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
technical),

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
 f Downstream, at the system verifica-

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
tion and validation stage, for mainte-

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
nance, and for preparing operational 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
solutions adapted to innovations.

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
Since the first 2020 – 2022 Work 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
Programme, all the UIC regional 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
coordinators have tried to give more 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
concrete content to the activity of 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
the regions with more ambitious work 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
programmes. It is a question of giving 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
more concrete expression to UIC.

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
UIC’s specific roles and responsibilities 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
started in 1922 with the idea to give 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
to the sector a common technical 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
framework.

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
 f The membership base will 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---

--- Document Chunk 540 ---

activities,

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
 f The budgets for regional 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
specific actions such as 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
training, projects and 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
sharing of experience, will 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
increase,

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
 f Consideration will be given 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
to the creation of decision-

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
maker delegates ensuring 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
a permanent presence in 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
the most active regions to 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
lead the programme and 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
articulate regional visions.

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
We have started to set up an inter-regional 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
exchange platform to decide on priorities 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
in terms of development, exchange, and 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
common standardisation activities. 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
As activity develops in Regions outside 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
Europe, this platform is intended to 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
become increasingly multilateral, as 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
illustrated by the figure below, and where 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
the ringfencing concept voted at the 99

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
th 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
General Assembly (in December 2021) 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
retain the Intellectual Property Rights within 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
is within the framework of Europe’s Rail

--- Document Chunk 571 ---

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
has progressed in particular through 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
the numerous webinars organised, the 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
definition of ambitious work programmes

REGIONAL ROADMAP  

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
FOR AFRICA

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
The consultations and high-level meetings organised in 2022 with members 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
(Tunisia, Algeria, Senegal) and institutions (African Union, European Union 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
Agency for Railways) show that there is potential and interest in jointly developing 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
an ambitious action programme. The Region, despite the positive prospects, is 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
still caught in a kind of vicious circle where the absence of a concrete project 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
implies a lack of efficiency and involvement of members.

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
The various actions carried out by the Presidency of the Africa Region and the 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
UIC services have led to the establishment of a new ambition for the region. 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
In particular, the Covid-19 crisis has enabled us to meet every two months for 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
African Rail Thursdays. 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
This paradoxical effect of a crisis has allowed us to realise that we have important 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
tasks ahead of us to develop rail in Africa, with four major axes:

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
 f To succeed in the digitalisation of the African railways,

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
 f To increase the power of the training actions and the African projects,

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
 f Adapting UIC technical specifications to the African context through a rein -

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
forced partnership with the African Union.

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
22

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
Today, 70% of the region’s dues go to core fees, which limits 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
the interest of members to become active members and 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
keeps the funds available for projects to a minimum, i.e., no 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
more than 90K€.

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
We collectively need a shock to be able to concretely 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
undertake the work programme which in order to reach 2026 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
would require about 300K€ per year dedicated to projects.

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
The feasibility of such an orientation depends on the clear will 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
of the members to get involved to the extent that is necessary.

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
It is obvious that it is not realistic to move to full payment 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
of dues by 2023. It is therefore proposed that this level be 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
achieved by gradually increasing the dues of existing members.

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
Commitment being the key to success, under the leadership 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
of our Chairman and with the personal involvement of the 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---

path to the new funding scheme and project programming 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
with the objective of:

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
 f Securing the path to the new funding scheme with interna-

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
tional institutions such as EIB, ISDB, World Bank, etc.,

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
 f Implementing the Work Programme,

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
 f Ensuring the programming of projects and actions, espe-

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
cially training,

 f Ensuring a stable and committed participation of UIC

REGIONAL ROADMAP  

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
FOR ASIA-PACIFIC

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
The Asia-Pacific region – which is seeing large-scale economic development and, 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
therefore, has growing urban and long-distance goods and passenger transport 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
needs – has established its work programme priorities around:

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
 f Cooperating and creating partnerships with stakeholders in the region in or-

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
der to complement UIC’s actions,

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
 f Knowing what the members’ and countries’ needs are by improving the qual-

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
ity and analysis of data collected,

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
 f Monitoring and establishing railway investment projects in the region,

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
 f Securing the path to the new funding scheme with international institutions 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
such as ADB, World Bank, etc.,

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
 f Sharing best practices, transferring technology, and training,

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
 f Technical advice and project reviews.

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
The recent work programmes were complemented by initiatives on:

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
 f Openness towards new members,

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
 f Creating new activities in the region,

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
 f Cooperating with other regions and between members,

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
 f Interoperability and connectivity along corridors,

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
 f Railway research.

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
The region’s new presidency from 2023 onwards will facilitate the establishment 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
of a new agenda for the next three years to start implementing the main goals of 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
the Manifesto, in line with the region’s needs.

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
26

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
Topics which have not yet received detailed attention 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
will be discussed or prioritised, such as future railway 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
telecommunications, the metre gauge, security (the Global 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
Railway Security Congress held in February 2023 and the 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
creation of a pool of correspondents from members in the 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
region). 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
The recurring theme of high-speed will continue to be explored 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
in the run-up to the 2023 World Congress in Marrakech and in 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
anticipation of the Congress in Beijing.

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
Finally, members will be further involved in the region’s 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
activities by progressively increasing the portfolio and budget. 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
New members’ potential must be realised, while regular links 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
with existing members and close links with the most active 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
and senior members are to be maintained.

REGIONAL ROADMAP  

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
FOR EUROPE

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
Even if geographically smaller than other regions, the European Region has 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
the greatest number of UIC members (120 at the time of writing) these being 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
fairly evenly spread amongst the active, associate and affiliate categories of 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
membership and in every area of the Region. 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
The railways in the European Region have been typically the most active in 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
generating ideas for and enabling the funding for the annual programme of 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
projects. Much of these projects were spawned as a result of the publication of 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
the versions of the Regional Technical Strategy Europe (RTSE) and the Railway 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
Standardisation Strategy Europe (RSSE).

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
There is an appetite amongst the European members for these regional projects 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
to be expanded to other UIC regions and the Regional members welcome the 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
idea of the inter-regional exchange platform to decide on priorities in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
development, exchange, and common standardisation activities.

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
UIC has published a wide range of technical documents with the first Leaflet 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
having been published in 1926. Since its creation in the late 1980s, the European 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
Standardisation Organisation CEN_CENELEC have been offered the opportunity, 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
via a Technical Cooperation Agreement, to have access to these documents for 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
controlled inclusion of relevant text which can be used in their ENs. 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
30

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
The Region pays particular attention to this interface so as 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
to ensure that opportunities are maximised, costs minimised 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
and that there is no unjustified duplication. 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
 f Building on the Region’s current action plan (see image) and 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
in clear support of this more generic UIC Work Programme, 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
the development of collective and collaborative thinking on 

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
identifying alternative sources of traction energy will con -

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
tinue and contribute to the overall target of net zero carbon 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
emissions. This will be in support of the work being undertak-

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
en within the Energy Sector of the Railway System Forum.

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
 f Advocacy towards the railways being the backbone of 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
sustainable mobility has manifested itself in current work-

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
streams for the development of freight and support by the 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
 f Over the past two years a programme of High-Level

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
National Association of Passenger Rail Operators (ANPTrilhos). 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
UIC was able to gain insight into their railway’s potential for development 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
through the visits by the Director-General and the LARA Region coordinator to 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
multiple Latin American countries, as well as meetings with leaders, especially 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
transport ministers, to take place in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil,

The meetings in Argentina brought together other potential UIC members such 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
as Bolivia, Guatemala, and Peru. Certain Central American countries might also 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
be interested such as El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica.

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
Following these efforts to promote the Association, Chilean railway operator EFE 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
and JSC, the Argentinian National Agency of Safety will respectively become an 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
associate member and an affiliate member of UIC as of 2023. A large number of 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
potential projects have been identified where UIC can assist the members of the 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
region in their implementation.

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
To this end, in addition to maintaining the relationship with current UIC members, 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
UIC has hired a person in the area to work on subjects of interest to the region, 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
and constitute the beginnings of a UIC office there. 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
The region’s needs are substantial as the national networks are either hardly or 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
not at all connected, and there is a real lack of best practices and standards.

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
34

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
Goals for the 2023 – 2025 period include:

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
 f Developing a Vision 2050 for the Region to foster 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
the growth of rail in Latin America,

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
 f Creating a network of experts that could support an 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
increasing number of railway projects in the region,

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
 f Sharing knowledge from the UIC working groups 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
and from international standards,

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
 f Creating new group to respond to specific problems 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
in the regions (e.g., asset management, safety, and 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
environmental threats) in coordination with the UIC 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
Rail System Department,

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
 f Creating a working group dedicated to freight 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
activities in coordination with the UIC Freight 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
Department.

REGIONAL ROADMAP  

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
FOR MIDDLE-EAST

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
The UIC Middle-East Region comprises around 15 members, spread across almost 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
all of the RAME countries, which are: Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Syria, and Israel. This is a very dynamic 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
region for the railway sector, with new high-speed lines and trains, infrastructure, 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
and services being developed. All of the countries in the region have plans for 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
the years to come.

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
Two new members will join this region end 2023: Etihad Rail from United Arab 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
Emirates and Oman Rail.

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
Incidentally, transporting goods between China and Europe via the southern 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
corridor, going via Iran and Turkey in particular is becoming more important. 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
Despite railways not being developed at the same rate across the board, given 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
that there are geopolitical, strategic, and financial differences between countries, 

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
UIC has seen a resurgence of activity thanks to the leadership from the Chair and 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
Vice-Chairs who have given a new lease of life to the region’s activities.

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
The regional roadmap for the 2023 – 2025 period follows the considerations 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
outlined in the Vision 2050 document produced by the Paris and Dubai-based 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
company IEC and delivered to the November 2022 RAME Regional Assembly in 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
Abu Dhabi.

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
38

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
The main initiatives to be carried out in 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
the 2023 – 2025 period are:

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
 f Creating a working group on goods 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
transport. The main points of inter -

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
est to be developed in the coming 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
years are the following:

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
 f Digitalising procedures,

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
 f The safety of goods,

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
 f Standardising rules for exchange,

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
 f Transporting containers.

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
 f Creating a taskforce on extreme 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
temperatures and desert conditions, 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
taking the inevitable effects of cli -

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
mate change into account which will 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
occur in the coming years,

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
 f Creating a taskforce on safety, fo-

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
cusing on the Middle-East,

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
 f Developing a network of security 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
experts, notably to address crisis 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
management,

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
 f Participating in a project to develop 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
hydrogen trains,

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
 f Creating a working group to assess 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
the needs linked to the development 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
of telecommunications,

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
 f Reinforcing training for subjects of 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
interest to the region. The plan is to 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
have a training session every three or 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
four months with the participation of 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
experts from all around the world,

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
 f To aid the region’s development 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
its projects and their financing are 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
to be better taken into considera -

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
tion. In May 2022, the decision was 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
therefore made to slightly raise the 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
regional share of the regional mem -

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
bers’ fees to allow for new projects 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
to be launched after they have 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
been proposed during the regional 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
meetings.

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
All these projects will produce concrete 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
results for the RAME region and will 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
contribute to the cohesion of the 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
region’s members who will have shared 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
objectives.

REGIONAL ROADMAP  

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
FOR NORTH AMERICA

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
Despite it being a very large geographic region, the North American Region 

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
comprises very few member companies. 

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
These members however cover the entire region as they are representative of 

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
the largest Class 1 freight companies (AAR); the largest Pan-American passenger 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
company (Amtrak), the American Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), 

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
Canada’s Railway Association (RAC), the Canadian passenger company VIA-Rail, 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
California High-Speed Rail Autority (CHSRA) and the Regulatory Agency for Rail 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
Transport (ARTF, Mexico). These form the bedrock of the region’s structure. 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
Amongst the topics which the region wishes to tackle in 2023 and beyond are:

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
 f Standards – understanding the working relationship between the AAR and 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
UIC publications and developing synergies,

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
 f Sustainability – advocating the railways in the region as a significant part of 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
the reduction of transport carbon emissions,

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
 f Stations – developing the station as the welcoming and SMART first point of 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
contact for the end-user with the network,

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
 f Cyber Security – working with other regions to stem the impact from possi -

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
ble attacks,

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
 f Safety.

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
Inevitably, as the Region grows its interests, there will be additions made to this 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
route map. There is a plan for the annual Regional Assembly in March 2023 and 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
for this to be coupled to a High-Level Exchange Meeting like the ones that have 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
been arranged in Europe.

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
42

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
On the issue of railway stations, the key 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
goals for this period are to better define 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
the role of station managers and study 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
ways of improving quality with the 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
ambition to use the gains of the digital 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
revolution to improve the services to 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
the customer and the efficiency of the 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
stations. 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
As Stations are the gateways to the 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
urban public transport network and to 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
the long-distance rail transport, they 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
also play a key role in fostering modal 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
shift to rail.

UIC seeks to maintain momentum and continue to deliver 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
breakthroughs in the following areas:

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
 f Raising awareness among policymakers to design policies 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
to incentivise rail,

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
 f Inspiring and empowering the railway sector to become 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
even more sustainable,

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
 f Advancing innovation in the railway sector,

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
 f Attract investment into railway projects,

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
 f Collaborating with and engaging civil society representatives.

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
This is achieved through:

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
 f Conveying the positive environmental & socio-economic 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
externalities from rail investment,

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
 f Showcasing leading solutions and approaches,

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
 f Demonstrating the growing ambition and action to drive 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
more ambition,

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
 f Demonstrating how railways are a critical mobility com-

--- Document Chunk 977 ---

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
community to connect

--- Document Chunk 982 ---

SUSTAINABILITY PLATFORM

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
The UIC Sustainability Platform of UIC provides focus and 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
leadership for the Environmental and Social sustainability 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
agenda in the global railway community. Those engaged in the 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
Sustainability Platform work collaboratively to both promote 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
and to keep railways as the greenest form of collective and 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
mass mobility. 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
The platform shares a vision of a future railway that is the 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
backbone of sustainable mobility. The platform is working 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
towards 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
connectivity that contributes to healthy and 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
sustainable lifestyles and economies on every continent 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
– for a railway that is zero emissions, resource efficient, a 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
community hub, accessible for all, and is both biodiverse 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
and a good neighbour. 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
The mission of the platform is to empower the global 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
railway community to be a driving force in a transition 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
to a sustainable carbon free transport system through 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
collaborative knowledge and advocacy.

TOWARDS DIGITAL RAILWAYS

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
Among the main digital railway programmes, projects or 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
initiatives that UIC seeks to highlight and materially develop 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
in each department, platform and forum, it is essential to 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
mention:

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
 f FRMCS (Future Railway Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
Communication System) programme: 

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
UIC is leading here the specification stream for the re-

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
placement and evolution of GSM-R by 5G technologies in 

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
the short term (first pilots expected in Europe by 2026), 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
but is also heavily involved in the corresponding indus -

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
trial stream for the preparation of the FRMCS ecosystem 

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
(5GRail project),

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
 f OSDM (Open Sales and Distribution Model) 

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
programme: UIC will increase its activities 

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
around international ticketing, particular-

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---
ly regarding multimodality aspects and 

--- Document Chunk 1196 ---
extend the opening of OSDM systems to 

--- Document Chunk 1197 ---
more distribution channels,

--- Document Chunk 1198 ---
 f Digital Platform for Freight: UIC is engaged at European 

--- Document Chunk 1199 ---
level in an ambitious initiative aiming to define and put in 

--- Document Chunk 1200 ---
place a set of digital solutions to improve the commercial 

--- Document Chunk 1201 ---
context and the operations of freight,

--- Document Chunk 1202 ---
 f Digital Modelling: Through its RSM (Railway 

--- Document Chunk 1203 ---
System Model) and OntoRail (Ontology for 

--- Document Chunk 1204 ---
Rail) projects, UIC seeks to facilitate the 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
convergence of the various models existing 

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
in the rail sector towards a CDM (Common 

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
Data Model),

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---

perts with artificial intelligence specialists to learn lessons 

--- Document Chunk 1213 ---
from other sectors,

--- Document Chunk 1214 ---
In alignment with its global strategy, UIC will keep on focusing 

--- Document Chunk 1215 ---
on all the dimensions of railway digitalisation, with two major 

--- Document Chunk 1216 ---
directions:

--- Document Chunk 1217 ---
 f The promotion and the dissemination of digital concepts 

--- Document Chunk 1218 ---
applied to the railways, in the frame of international and 

--- Document Chunk 1219 ---
regional actions, such as, but not limited to:

--- Document Chunk 1220 ---
 - Participation in major international events (Consumer 

--- Document Chunk 1221 ---
Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas, UIC High Speed 

--- Document Chunk 1222 ---
Congress, etc.),

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
 - Organisation of Digital Tours with representatives from 

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
UIC members,

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
 - Organisation of specific regional events focused on dig-

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
ital, as for instance the African Digital Rail Congress (4

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
th 

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
edition expected in 2024);

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
 f The development of specific projects dedicated to digital 

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
railway in which UIC can bring its specific added-value to 

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
the benefit of its members, and this regarding different 

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
domains:

--- Document Chunk 1233 ---
 - The technical aspects of the rail system in general,

--- Document Chunk 1234 ---
 - Passenger activities,

--- Document Chunk 1235 ---
 - Freight activities,

--- Document Chunk 1236 ---
 - And also some multi-domain digital initiatives.

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
 f OpenRail: UIC, together with three initial 

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
members, aims to put in place the first 

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
open-source foundation dedicated to the 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
railway industry,

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
 f The railway system architecture and the relevant exchange 

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
of data for more efficient operations.

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
At European level, the majority of these programmes, projects 

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
or initiatives are or may be combined with ERJU activities, 

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
this being already the case for FRMCS and Digital Modelling. 

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
This is the intention of UIC to keep on assessing additional 

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
synergies with the European Commission and European 

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
railways, for instance regarding the railway system architecture, 

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
the development of the OSDM programme, the establishment 

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
of the Freight Digital Platform and the use cases of Digital 

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
Automatic Coupling (DAC).

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
All these UIC digital activities will participate in the different 

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
regional activities, according to adapted timing corresponding 

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
to regional priorities and needs expressed by members. 

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
As an example, it is clear that the FRMCS programme has 

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
to be considered on a worldwide dimension, to be adapted 

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
to the different regions in accordance with the members’ 

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
strategy and involvement.

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
Concerning Innovations, RSF will place emphasis on:

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---
 f FRMCS (specifications and industrial stream) and digital 

--- Document Chunk 1267 ---
modelling, as detailed in part 2,

--- Document Chunk 1268 ---
 f Reduction of energy consumption and emissions a Task 

--- Document Chunk 1269 ---
Force on Energy saving will be scheduled end of 2022 and 

--- Document Chunk 1270 ---
early 2023,

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
 f Development of lighter trains,

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
 f Resilience of railway infrastructures and rolling stock to 

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
climate change, including design of new infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1274 ---
and rolling stock, more accurate weather forecasts and 

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
operational mitigation measures,

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
 f Acceleration of the cycle of innovation, through opera-

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
tional rules adapted to market uptake of innovative solu-

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
tions, and dissemination of innovative solutions.

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
The key enablers of the eight RSF multi-annual work 

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
programmes are the following:

--- Document Chunk 1281 ---
 f The eight multi-annual Sector Work Programmes will en -

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
sure the structuring of the UIC technical documents. The 

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
revision of documents on a five-year cycle, when deemed 

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
necessary by members will be ensured together with the 

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
publication of other appropriate UIC documents: specifi-

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
cations, reports and guidelines.

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
STRATEGY & MAIN DELIVERABLES

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
The Railway System Forum (RSF) will support the UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
“Vision of Rail 2030” and will integrate, in a systemic 

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
approach, major technical breakthroughs through its eight 

--- Document Chunk 1291 ---
multi-annual work programmes based on Capacity, Quality 

--- Document Chunk 1292 ---
of service and continuous improvement of railway services, 

--- Document Chunk 1293 ---
and Innovations.

--- Document Chunk 1294 ---
Concerning Capacity, RSF will place emphasis on:

--- Document Chunk 1295 ---
 f Traffic control centres and crisis management,

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
 f Automation facilitating the increase in the number of 

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
trains and supporting the cost leadership strategy:

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
 - Digital Automatic Coupling (DAC),

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
 - Automated Train Operations (ATO),

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
 - Artificial Intelligence,

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
 - Robotics,

--- Document Chunk 1302 ---
 - Automatic inspections,

--- Document Chunk 1303 ---
 - 5G evolution.

--- Document Chunk 1304 ---
Concerning Quality of Service and continuous improvement 

--- Document Chunk 1305 ---
of railway services, RSF will place emphasis on:

--- Document Chunk 1306 ---
 f Operations and safety as detailed in part 7,

--- Document Chunk 1307 ---
 f Predictive maintenance, for better reliability and availa-

--- Document Chunk 1308 ---
bility of infrastructure and rolling stock, and better inte -

--- Document Chunk 1309 ---
gration in operations,

--- Document Chunk 1310 ---
 f Reduction of railway noise, facilitating the acceptance of 

--- Document Chunk 1311 ---
the increasing number of trains by those in the vicinity of 

--- Document Chunk 1312 ---
the railway lines.

UIC is involved in both:

--- Document Chunk 1333 ---
 f System Pillar, as technical 

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
coordinator and/or 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
team leader of Railway

--- Document Chunk 1341 ---
 f Innovation Pillar, as 

--- Document Chunk 1342 ---
affiliated to ERJU Founding 

--- Document Chunk 1343 ---
members.

--- Document Chunk 1344 ---
UIC will work in order to avoid 

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
any duplication of work or gap 

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
between UIC activities and 

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
ERJU: some Opt-in projects 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
will naturally be transformed 

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
into activities inside ERJU, 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
others will complement the 

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
activities of ERJU. All this 

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
work of synchronisation will 

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
also help the RICG (Research 

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
and Innovation Coordination 

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
Group). Finally, some of the 

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
achievements will support 

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
the preparation of the future 

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
ERRAC Strategic Innovation 

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
Agenda, which will be a main 

--- Document Chunk 1360 ---
input of the Master Plan of the 

--- Document Chunk 1361 ---
successor of the ERJU.

--- Document Chunk 1362 ---
In addition, UIC is ready to

facilitate the dissemination of 

--- Document Chunk 1364 ---
ERJU outputs.

--- Document Chunk 1365 ---
DEVELOPMENT OF UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1366 ---
DOCUMENTS 

--- Document Chunk 1367 ---
As explained above, the RSF will rely on 

--- Document Chunk 1368 ---
both the V-cycle, which distinguishes 

--- Document Chunk 1369 ---
specifications and guidelines from 

--- Document Chunk 1370 ---
manufacturers’ standards, and the ERA-UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1371 ---
Coordination framework, which highlights 

--- Document Chunk 1372 ---
the importance of AMoCs (operational 

--- Document Chunk 1373 ---
guidelines approved by ERA). Specifications 

--- Document Chunk 1374 ---
and guidelines may need inputs from UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1375 ---
(technical) reports.

--- Document Chunk 1376 ---
It implies that manufacturers’ standards 

--- Document Chunk 1377 ---
will be the responsibility of standardisation 

--- Document Chunk 1378 ---
organisations (CEN-CENELEC, ETSI, ISO, 

--- Document Chunk 1379 ---
IEC), whereas UIC will focus on (technical) 

--- Document Chunk 1380 ---
specifications and guidelines, and (technical 

--- Document Chunk 1381 ---
reports) as inputs for specifications and 

--- Document Chunk 1382 ---
guidelines.

--- Document Chunk 1383 ---
The Standardisation Unit will have, with the 

--- Document Chunk 1384 ---
support of the Standardisation Platform 

--- Document Chunk 1385 ---
and on behalf of any UIC Departments, 

--- Document Chunk 1386 ---
Forums and Platforms, the following remit 

--- Document Chunk 1387 ---
during the 2023-2025 period:

--- Document Chunk 1388 ---
 f Promoting a new user-friendly UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1389 ---
Library, open to any UIC members, with 

--- Document Chunk 1390 ---
relevant and updated specifications, 

--- Document Chunk 1391 ---
guidelines and reports (called publica -

--- Document Chunk 1392 ---
tions in the rest of this paragraph),

--- Document Chunk 1393 ---
 f Ensuring that every UIC department, 

--- Document Chunk 1394 ---
Forum and Platform will systematically 

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
review the specifications, guidelines and 

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
reports they are responsible for where 

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
necessary and at least every five years. 

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
The objective is to maintain UIC publica-

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
tions as state-of-the-art,

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
 f Publishing the annual UIC work pro-

--- Document Chunk 1401 ---
gramme regarding revision, approval 

--- Document Chunk 1402 ---
and publication of existing and new 

--- Document Chunk 1403 ---
publications,

--- Document Chunk 1404 ---
 f Supporting the efforts of ETF in order to 

--- Document Chunk 1405 ---
quickly publish any new or updated UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1406 ---
documents,

--- Document Chunk 1407 ---
 f Defending the interests of UIC, notably 

--- Document Chunk 1408 ---
the intellectual property on any UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1409 ---
publications, at national, European and 

--- Document Chunk 1410 ---
global level, to the benefit of our railway 

--- Document Chunk 1411 ---
members,

--- Document Chunk 1412 ---
 f Ensuring the right coordination between 

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
UIC and standardisation organisations 

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
(CEN_CENELEC, ETSI, IEC, ISO, OSJD),

--- Document Chunk 1415 ---
 f Ensuring the right coordination between

--- Document Chunk 1421 ---
The Rail System Forum (RSF) 

--- Document Chunk 1422 ---
is ready to:

--- Document Chunk 1423 ---
 f Host any UIC member 

--- Document Chunk 1424 ---
from any region, ready to 

--- Document Chunk 1425 ---
participate in RSF Opt-in 

--- Document Chunk 1426 ---
projects,

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
 f Adapt UIC specifications 

--- Document Chunk 1428 ---
and guidelines to specific

PSG: Passenger Services Group

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
The main challenge for the PSG in the 2023 – 2025 period 

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
is implementing the Ticketing Roadmap which has been 

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
jointly drafted with UIC, CER and CIT. The roadmap mainly 

--- Document Chunk 1456 ---
consists of the deployment of OSDM (Open Sales and 

--- Document Chunk 1457 ---
Distribution Model) by the European UIC members, but also 

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
by other stakeholders: third parties and multimodal transport 

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
operators. The certification of OSDM stakeholders and tools 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
will be developed with the participation of the PATRIC audit 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
group.

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
Other challenges for the PSG in coming years:

--- Document Chunk 1463 ---
 f Providing technical support to the CER passenger work -

--- Document Chunk 1464 ---
ing groups related to regulations (TAP-TSI, MMTIS, PRR, 

--- Document Chunk 1465 ---
MDMS),

--- Document Chunk 1466 ---
 f Defining the UIC vision for architecture for a multimodal 

--- Document Chunk 1467 ---
solution, agreeing with DG Move on the necessity of hav -

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
ing a high-level solution,

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
 f Facilitating interoperability for sales flows (booking, tick -

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
eting, after-sales) with OSDM being the reference for 

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
railways,

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
 f Defining solutions architecture with IATA within the Air/

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
Rail IATA/UIC initiative and implementing pilot schemes 

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
by 2025,

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
 f Integrating urban transport based on the Swedish mar-

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
ket SAMTRAFIKEN experiment while working with urban 

--- Document Chunk 1477 ---
transport stakeholders (the Smart Ticketing Alliance, 

--- Document Chunk 1478 ---
for example) to define the solution architecture for 

--- Document Chunk 1479 ---
interoperability.

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
Accessibility and inclusion are also part of the PSG Working 

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
Groups’ (PASSAGE) activities to make railways welcoming 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
and easier for a wider range of clients, in particular those with 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
disabilities and reduced mobility.

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
STRATEGY & MAIN DELIVERABLES

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
In order to develop passenger transport and increase rail’s 

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
modal share (over car and planes), customer experience must 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
be at the forefront of considerations as this is the deciding 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
factor on which mode of transport is taken.

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
UIC’s passenger activities are steered by the Global Passenger 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---
Forum, in coordination with all the department’s sectors. A 

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
transverse project planned for the 2023 – 2025 period will 

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
cover customer experience to foster a culture orientated 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
towards the customer as a key element for the future success 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
of railways, permeating though all levels of the sector from 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
top management to people working in the rail company.

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
Over the next three years UIC’s activities will be structured 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
as follows.

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
63

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
UNlOCK MUlTIMODalITY FOR PasseNGeRs

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
Intercity and High-Speed

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
In Europe the group supports the EU’s consolidation of the 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
new market following the 4 th package. UIC will pursue the 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
cooperation with air (IATA) in order to facilitate joint initiatives 

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
among members and boost passenger preference for rail.

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
Two World Congresses on High-Speed Rail will be organised 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
for the 2023 – 2025 period. 

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
The first will take place on 7 – 10 March 2023 in Marrakech 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
under the slogan “High-speed rail: the right speed for our 

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
planet”. The second will be held in Beijing in 2024 or 2025 

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
depending on the health situation.

--- Document Chunk 1511 ---
Two levels of training sessions 

--- Document Chunk 1512 ---
on high-speed railways will also 

--- Document Chunk 1513 ---
take place in this time period.

--- Document Chunk 1514 ---
International cooperation

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
International cooperation will increase, in particular with IATA 

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
and UNECE in order to better align the concepts with those 

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
leading international bodies. Finally, During the 2023 – 2025 

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
period, a world conference on stations (Nextstation) will be 

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
organised with a UIC member hosting the event.

--- Document Chunk 1520 ---

--- Document Chunk 1521 ---
POSITION VS ERJU

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
Passenger issues are not 

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
present in ERJU as such. 

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
However, the previous JU 

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---
(Shift2Rail) worked on 

--- Document Chunk 1526 ---
ticketing systems in IP 4. 

--- Document Chunk 1527 ---
It is still too early to know how 

--- Document Chunk 1528 ---
these developments can be 

--- Document Chunk 1529 ---
linked to the ongoing work 

--- Document Chunk 1530 ---
on OSDM and multimodal 

--- Document Chunk 1531 ---
ticketing within UIC, but it is 

--- Document Chunk 1532 ---
clear that their implementation 

--- Document Chunk 1533 ---
will require greater 

--- Document Chunk 1534 ---
cooperation.

--- Document Chunk 1535 ---
Moreover, even if it is still 

--- Document Chunk 1536 ---
difficult to know if the 

--- Document Chunk 1537 ---
technical work needed for 

--- Document Chunk 1538 ---
the implementation of the 

--- Document Chunk 1539 ---
European Data Space will be 

--- Document Chunk 1540 ---
financed within the framework 

--- Document Chunk 1541 ---
of ERJU or other European 

--- Document Chunk 1542 ---
projects, it is certain that 

--- Document Chunk 1543 ---
establishing connections with 

--- Document Chunk 1544 ---
the railway ecosystem will 

--- Document Chunk 1545 ---
only be possible with UIC’s 

--- Document Chunk 1546 ---
involvement. 

--- Document Chunk 1547 ---
Indeed, OSDM is the main 

--- Document Chunk 1548 ---
link between a potential 

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
intermodal vision with rail 

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
as the backbone. On a more 

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
political level, the UIC will 

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
provide its technical support 

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---
to the CER to define a data 

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
sharing strategy, because 

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
the definition of what should 

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---
remain the property of 

--- Document Chunk 1557 ---
operators is the focus of 

--- Document Chunk 1558 ---
discussion.

--- Document Chunk 1559 ---

and put rail at the centre of sustainable 

--- Document Chunk 1565 ---
mobility of the future.

--- Document Chunk 1566 ---

--- Document Chunk 1567 ---
Identify new business opportunities for 

--- Document Chunk 1568 ---

PARTICIPATION IN THE 

--- Document Chunk 1574 ---
REGIONAL STRATEGY

--- Document Chunk 1575 ---
All the actions and projects 

--- Document Chunk 1576 ---
developed in the passenger 

--- Document Chunk 1577 ---
transport sector contribute 

--- Document Chunk 1578 ---
to the development of the 

--- Document Chunk 1579 ---
regions, not only for Europe 

--- Document Chunk 1580 ---
but for all the continents.

--- Document Chunk 1581 ---
For example the activities 

--- Document Chunk 1582 ---
of the Passenger Services 

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
Group are mainly focused 

--- Document Chunk 1584 ---
on ticketing in many parts of 

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
Europe and several countries 

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
in the Middle-East and Asia-

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
Pacific. The OSDM (Open 

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
Sales and Distribution Model) 

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
specification as well as the 

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
other associated tools could 

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
be extended to other regions 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
as it is an open specification 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
(osdm.io).

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
The working group on persons 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
with reduced mobility consists 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
of members from several 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
continents. An Australian 

--- Document Chunk 1598 ---
company has bought the

The Station Managers’ Global

--- Document Chunk 1605 ---
just over a year ago, and a new 

--- Document Chunk 1606 ---
activity has started in North 

--- Document Chunk 1607 ---
America which will address 

--- Document Chunk 1608 ---
topics on best practice and 

--- Document Chunk 1609 ---
climate change issues. 

--- Document Chunk 1610 ---
The High-Speed Committee is 

--- Document Chunk 1611 ---
open to members across the 

--- Document Chunk 1612 ---
world, as almost all entities 

--- Document Chunk 1613 ---
which undertake high-speed 

--- Document Chunk 1614 ---
activities are part of the group. 

--- Document Chunk 1615 ---
Guidelines are developed 

--- Document Chunk 1616 ---
within this area and are made

INCREASING RAIL FREIGHT

MODAL SHARE

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
The combined implementation of these will generate the full 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
effect desired. With this in mind, in 2022 RFF initiated the “Year 

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
of IM” which is a joint vision between rail operators (freight 

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
and passenger) and infrastructure managers regarding the 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
priority changes which need to take place within the rail 

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
system. 

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
The vision will be followed by a common implementation plan 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
around the following actions:

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
1. Contribute to the definition of the target capacity man -

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
agement process and planning,

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
2. Focus on operational concepts in case of ICMs,

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
3. Seek to align stakeholders around a common concept 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
for the border section and cross-border-processes 

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
so to ensure maximum fluidity for international cargo 

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
transportation,

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
4. Support members in their national stakeholder discussion 

--- Document Chunk 1649 ---
on the implementation of Digital Capacity Management,

--- Document Chunk 1650 ---
5. Drive, in partnership with RNE the elaborating a common 

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
approach towards data exchange.

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
The implementation of the aforementioned technologies will 

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
generate an increasing amount of data. This data needs to be 

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
standardised, consumed and provided seamlessly. 

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
STRATEGY & MAIN DELIVERABLES

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
The sustainability challenge is the underlying driver of the 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
freight vision no matter the region. Enabling modal shift 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
towards rail is key to achieving this ambition.

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
The Covid pandemic and the energy crisis have emphasised 

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
the importance of rail freight for Europe, as it is the only 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
sustainable land transport mode being seven times more 

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
energy efficient than road transport. 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
This ambition is however constrained by an acute shortage 

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
of infrastructure capacity. The European members of the UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
Freight Forum, united within the Rail Freight Forward (RFF) 

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
Coalition, which is managed by UIC, have therefore agreed a 

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
programme based on digital game changers to address this 

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
challenge together with Infrastructure Managers. 

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
In parallel they continue to work on areas with a comparatively 

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---
shorter time to implementation than the digital game 

--- Document Chunk 1671 ---
changers. These are referred to as “quick wins”.

--- Document Chunk 1672 ---
Capacity is the most expensive recourse we have in rail freight 

--- Document Chunk 1673 ---
and therefore needs to be used efficiently. 

--- Document Chunk 1674 ---
Efficiency gains can be achieved within the system by 

--- Document Chunk 1675 ---
harmonising and coordinating processes between countries 

--- Document Chunk 1676 ---
thus avoiding unnecessary stops at borders for instance 

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
which are resource and capacity intensive.

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
Under the umbrella of RFF, five digital game changers 

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
were identified as key enablers to deliver the bigger sector 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
ambition of reaching 30% freight market share by 2030. 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
These are ERTMS, ATO, DAC, Digital Platform, Digital Capacity 

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
Management. 

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
INCReasING RaIl FReIGhT MODal shaRe

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
For rail freight, the challenge is to ensure all rail operators, 

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
regardless of their IT maturity, can contribute to this process 

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
so to establish rail freight as a seamless stakeholder in an “end 

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
to end” logistic chain.

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
This is the goal of the DP-RAIL project which aims to set 

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
up a digital platform for the rail freight ecosystem focusing, 

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
in a first step, on digital solutions for core rail operational 

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
processes with a view of supporting TAF TSI compliance.

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
UIC is coordinating this process on behalf of a Consortium 

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
of early investors and is seeking EU funding to support the 

--- Document Chunk 1695 ---
initiative. (dp-rail.eu).

--- Document Chunk 1696 ---
In addition to these workstreams, UIC Freight is strengthening 

--- Document Chunk 1697 ---
its core areas of expertise in the following domains:

--- Document Chunk 1698 ---
 f Wagon utilisation,

--- Document Chunk 1699 ---
 f Corridor development,

--- Document Chunk 1700 ---
 f Train operation,

--- Document Chunk 1701 ---
 f Load safety,

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
 f Combined transport,

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
 f Dangerous goods,

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
 f Seamless data exchange.

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
How these groups/domains provide business value to UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
members in their daily business formed part of the “Fit for 

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
Freight” dissemination campaign to celebrate UIC’s 100

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
th 

--- Document Chunk 1709 ---
anniversary. 

--- Document Chunk 1710 ---
In view of the positive feedback received for this initiative, the 

--- Document Chunk 1711 ---
freight department will adjust the concept in 2023 to increase 

--- Document Chunk 1712 ---
its offer of support to members and onboard newcomers.

POSITION VS ERJU

--- Document Chunk 1715 ---
The driver language topic 

--- Document Chunk 1716 ---
received funding from the then 

--- Document Chunk 1717 ---
called Shift2Rail. The project 

--- Document Chunk 1718 ---
was known as Translate4Rail 

--- Document Chunk 1719 ---
(translate4rail.eu) and ended 

--- Document Chunk 1720 ---
in December 2021.

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
At the request of ERJU, several 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
live demonstrations of the 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
prototype potential were 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
performed in 2022: WCRR, 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
Innotrans, TRA. Some Safety 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
Authorities also expressed an 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
interest in receiving additional 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
information in order to assess 

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
the possibility of the prototype 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
with regard to their specific 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
border issues.

--- Document Chunk 1732 ---
The topic is included in the 

--- Document Chunk 1733 ---
current work programme of 

--- Document Chunk 1734 ---
ERJU although not picked up 

--- Document Chunk 1735 ---
as immediate priority.

--- Document Chunk 1736 ---
The concept of DP-RAIL is not 

--- Document Chunk 1737 ---
addressed by the ERJU work 

--- Document Chunk 1738 ---
programme. It is therefore 

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
envisaged to seek EU funding 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
from other programmes. Once 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
the platform is launched, it 

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
could however become the 

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
place towards which new 

--- Document Chunk 1744 ---
freight related operational 

--- Document Chunk 1745 ---
solutions developed in ERJU 

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
could migrate.

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
One of the freight flagship areas is the work 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
performed in the wagon domain. In 2023, 

--- Document Chunk 1749 ---
work will specifically address:

--- Document Chunk 1750 ---
 f The process steps for repairs of enroute 

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
damages (GCU repairs) against the 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
background of the processes described 

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
in detail in the ECM Regulation (ECM 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
maintenance),

--- Document Chunk 1755 ---
 f The continuous improvement of the 

--- Document Chunk 1756 ---
ATTI process will aim to strengthen this 

--- Document Chunk 1757 ---
safe and simplified wagon exchange/

--- Document Chunk 1758 ---
train handover process further especial-

--- Document Chunk 1759 ---
ly through the enhancement of the qual-

--- Document Chunk 1760 ---
ity guidelines and management system 

--- Document Chunk 1761 ---
and by undertaking a Risk Assessment 

--- Document Chunk 1762 ---
by an independent body.

--- Document Chunk 1763 ---
UIC was a forerunner in the shaping and 

--- Document Chunk 1764 ---
implementation of the corridor concept. 

--- Document Chunk 1765 ---
With a view to overcoming interoperability 

--- Document Chunk 1766 ---
barriers, the ECCO group will support 

--- Document Chunk 1767 ---
the TEN-T revision from an operational 

--- Document Chunk 1768 ---
perspective.

--- Document Chunk 1769 ---
The unique asset base (IRS, guidelines and 

--- Document Chunk 1770 ---
Leaflets) and expertise of UIC in combined 

--- Document Chunk 1771 ---
transport will, from an operational and 

--- Document Chunk 1772 ---
technical perspective, continue to support 

--- Document Chunk 1773 ---
the high-stake discussions on the combined 

--- Document Chunk 1774 ---
transport directive revision and the weights

and dimensions of road vehicles.

PARTICIPATION IN THE 

--- Document Chunk 1779 ---
REGIONAL STRATEGY

--- Document Chunk 1780 ---
UIC Freight contributes 

--- Document Chunk 1781 ---
to the European Strategy 

--- Document Chunk 1782 ---
mainly through the Rail 

--- Document Chunk 1783 ---
Freight Forward Initiatives 

--- Document Chunk 1784 ---
which it coordinates (www.

--- Document Chunk 1785 ---
railfreightforward.eu). As 

--- Document Chunk 1786 ---
described in the above 

--- Document Chunk 1787 ---
sections the key objectives lie 

--- Document Chunk 1788 ---
with operational and capacity 

--- Document Chunk 1789 ---
improvements.

--- Document Chunk 1790 ---
On a global level, 

--- Document Chunk 1791 ---
the development of 

--- Document Chunk 1792 ---
intercontinental corridors has 

--- Document Chunk 1793 ---
opened promising perspectives 

--- Document Chunk 1794 ---
to the growth of rail transport 

--- Document Chunk 1795 ---
over long distances as an 

--- Document Chunk 1796 ---
alternative to other modes 

--- Document Chunk 1797 ---
(mainly maritime and road) and 

--- Document Chunk 1798 ---
as a key partner in a robust and 

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
sustainable logistic chain. The 

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
corridor concept has been a 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
driver for international freight 

--- Document Chunk 1802 ---
development and collaboration 

--- Document Chunk 1803 ---
in which UIC has played a 

--- Document Chunk 1804 ---
catalytic role for over a decade.

--- Document Chunk 1805 ---
According to its mission, UIC 

--- Document Chunk 1806 ---
has focused its contribution 

--- Document Chunk 1807 ---
on improving harmonisation 

--- Document Chunk 1808 ---
and interoperability of 

--- Document Chunk 1809 ---
operation along the corridors in 

--- Document Chunk 1810 ---
collaboration with its members, 

--- Document Chunk 1811 ---
partner organisations and 

--- Document Chunk 1812 ---
business stakeholders. 

--- Document Chunk 1813 ---
In addition to regular market 

--- Document Chunk 1814 ---
monitoring along the Eurasian 

--- Document Chunk 1815 ---
corridors, UIC’s expertise in 

--- Document Chunk 1816 ---
operationalisation of corridors 

--- Document Chunk 1817 ---
has reinforced collaboration 

--- Document Chunk 1818 ---
with other partner associations 

--- Document Chunk 1819 ---
such TRACECA, UNECE, FIATA, 

--- Document Chunk 1820 ---
etc.

--- Document Chunk 1821 ---
Furthermore, corridor 

--- Document Chunk 1822 ---
management should not be 

--- Document Chunk 1823 ---
seen as a regional activity. The 

--- Document Chunk 1824 ---
various studies and interviews 

--- Document Chunk 1825 ---
we conducted illustrated 

--- Document Chunk 1826 ---
this. The complementarity of 

--- Document Chunk 1827 ---
corridors is an important point 

--- Document Chunk 1828 ---
but a tailored approach to 

--- Document Chunk 1829 ---
each of them is also required. 

--- Document Chunk 1830 ---
In 2023, it is therefore 

--- Document Chunk 1831 ---
envisaged to set up a network 

--- Document Chunk 1832 ---
of corridors with the aim to:

--- Document Chunk 1833 ---
 f Identify and monitor the 

--- Document Chunk 1834 ---
business potential behind 

--- Document Chunk 1835 ---
each route: identify success 

--- Document Chunk 1836 ---
factors and target markets,

--- Document Chunk 1837 ---
 f Propose individual action 

--- Document Chunk 1838 ---
plan in line with the 

--- Document Chunk 1839 ---
strategy of their “natural” 

--- Document Chunk 1840 ---
Region with the aim to have 

--- Document Chunk 1841 ---
concrete implementation 

--- Document Chunk 1842 ---
projects,

--- Document Chunk 1843 ---
 f Organise one or two cross 

--- Document Chunk 1844 ---
regional conferences/

--- Document Chunk 1845 ---
workshops per year,

--- Document Chunk 1846 ---
 f Continue dialogue with 

--- Document Chunk 1847 ---
international partner 

--- Document Chunk 1848 ---
organisations,

--- Document Chunk 1849 ---
 f Engage with development 

--- Document Chunk 1850 ---
banks,

--- Document Chunk 1851 ---
 f Facilitate integration 

--- Document Chunk 1852 ---
between stakeholders,

--- Document Chunk 1853 ---
 f Promote interoperability 

--- Document Chunk 1854 ---
projects and harmonisation 

--- Document Chunk 1855 ---
capitalising on expertise.

--- Document Chunk 1856 ---
UIC will continue to develop its 

--- Document Chunk 1857 ---
global mission by deepening 

--- Document Chunk 1858 ---
and extending it corridor 

--- Document Chunk 1859 ---
activities to other regions. 

--- Document Chunk 1860 ---
LARA region is in focus. 

--- Document Chunk 1861 ---
Creating the necessary uptake

AND OPERATIONS

--- Document Chunk 1872 ---
THE MAIN OUTCOMES OF THE OPERATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 1873 ---
SECTOR & SAFETY PLATFORM

--- Document Chunk 1874 ---
The first fundamental – safety, with an integrated 

--- Document Chunk 1875 ---
approach

--- Document Chunk 1876 ---
Digitalisation in railways will dramatically increase the amount 

--- Document Chunk 1877 ---
of data collected for the benefit of an even better safety 

--- Document Chunk 1878 ---
management. But at the same time digitalisation increases 

--- Document Chunk 1879 ---
a false feeling of total control: the world is becoming more 

--- Document Chunk 1880 ---
complex, increasing the uncertainties and the limits of models.

--- Document Chunk 1881 ---
Furthermore, new societal issues need to be considered since 

--- Document Chunk 1882 ---
the Covid-19 pandemic. The health and safety of customers 

--- Document Chunk 1883 ---
and of the workforce are the top priority for keeping railways 

--- Document Chunk 1884 ---
running. Finally, the consequences related to climate change 

--- Document Chunk 1885 ---
will force us to establish a crises and risks typology and adopt 

--- Document Chunk 1886 ---
crisis and risk-oriented planning methodologies.

--- Document Chunk 1887 ---
The new approach to safety and performance developed in 

--- Document Chunk 1888 ---
UIC must be global and transversal.

--- Document Chunk 1889 ---
Approach for an Integrated Safety Approach

--- Document Chunk 1890 ---
The strategic objectives of the Operations Sector are:

--- Document Chunk 1891 ---
 f Contribution to the Design and Organisation of Future 

--- Document Chunk 1892 ---
Railway Operations & traffic management:

--- Document Chunk 1893 ---
 f Traffic Control Centres & crises management,

--- Document Chunk 1894 ---
 f CCS & increase of the railway capacity.

--- Document Chunk 1895 ---
 f Definition of digital opportunities & use cases for the per-

--- Document Chunk 1896 ---
formance of operations:

--- Document Chunk 1897 ---
 f Support to Automation (DAC, ATO, Artificial Intelligence, 

--- Document Chunk 1898 ---
Robotics, 5G use cases, etc.),

--- Document Chunk 1899 ---
 f Railway Digital Modelling,

--- Document Chunk 1900 ---
 f Enhancing real time operations & customer information 

--- Document Chunk 1901 ---
during disrupted situations: digital platforms for interoper-

--- Document Chunk 1902 ---
ability of data operations and exchanges between railway 

--- Document Chunk 1903 ---
undertakings & infrastructure managers.

--- Document Chunk 1904 ---
 f Digitalisation of safety methods:

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
 f new methods for safety demonstrations based on risk 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
analyses processes, aiming at an internationalisation of 

--- Document Chunk 1907 ---
certifications & approvals of innovative systems.

--- Document Chunk 1908 ---
They will be achieved through:

--- Document Chunk 1909 ---
 f Delivering of harmonised operational specifications in 

--- Document Chunk 1910 ---
addition to manufacturers’ standards, as an acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 1911 ---
means of compliance,

--- Document Chunk 1912 ---
 f Training: this demand from UIC members is compliant 

--- Document Chunk 1913 ---
with the necessary acceleration of the innovation cycle,

--- Document Chunk 1914 ---
 f Organising the Return of Experience “REX” within UIC, so 

--- Document Chunk 1915 ---
that Operations & Safety are correctly monitored, via an 

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---
integrated safety approach, driving a library of bowties 

--- Document Chunk 1917 ---
and safety barriers classification. For Europe, that will be 

--- Document Chunk 1918 ---
included within ERA JNS processes and future CSM ASLP,

--- Document Chunk 1919 ---

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
are already available and will be

sults of the work performed within

the security platform activities.

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
The main priority topics highlighted by 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
the members of the security platform 

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
for 2023 – 2025 are as follows:

--- Document Chunk 2025 ---
 f Emerging threats: cybersecuri-

--- Document Chunk 2026 ---
ty, CBRN (chemical, Biological 

--- Document Chunk 2027 ---
Radiological, Nuclear), insider 

--- Document Chunk 2028 ---

--- Document Chunk 2029 ---
 f Crisis management in case of physi-

--- Document Chunk 2030 ---

--- Document Chunk 2031 ---
 f Cross border issues regarding train 

--- Document Chunk 2032 ---

--- Document Chunk 2033 ---
 f Integration and implementation 

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
environment,

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
 f Training of staff,

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
 f Emerging security topics linked to 

--- Document Chunk 2038 ---
current concerns.

--- Document Chunk 2039 ---
STRATEGY & MAIN 

--- Document Chunk 2040 ---
DELIVERABLES

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
The security of passengers and goods 

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
as well as the security of staff are key 

--- Document Chunk 2043 ---
elements to boost the attractiveness 

--- Document Chunk 2044 ---
and efficiency of rail transport. Security 

--- Document Chunk 2045 ---
threats are a growing concern in many 

--- Document Chunk 2046 ---
rail companies: there are daily threats 

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
such as aggression, pickpocketing, 

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
theft or graffiti, but there are also 

--- Document Chunk 2049 ---
more dramatic events such as terrorist 

--- Document Chunk 2050 ---
attacks. These threats can have a high 

--- Document Chunk 2051 ---
impact, create a feeling of insecurity 

--- Document Chunk 2052 ---
and prevent customers from choosing 

--- Document Chunk 2053 ---
rail transport.

--- Document Chunk 2054 ---
In this context the main objectives 

--- Document Chunk 2055 ---
of the security platform are to share 

--- Document Chunk 2056 ---
experiences, develop recommendations 

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---
and address emerging threats to help 

--- Document Chunk 2058 ---
rail security managers to build their 

--- Document Chunk 2059 ---
security policies.

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
The UIC security platform is organised 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
around:

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
 f An annual congress to take stock of 

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---
the work carried out and to propose 

--- Document Chunk 2064 ---
future priorities,

--- Document Chunk 2065 ---
 f A steering committee which meets 

--- Document Chunk 2066 ---
every quarter involving the UIC re -

--- Document Chunk 2067 ---

--- Document Chunk 2068 ---

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
POSITION VS ERJU

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
Rail Security is not part of 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
the ERJU roadmap, however 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
involvement in EU funded 

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
security research projects 

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
is a key activity to develop 

--- Document Chunk 2079 ---
innovative rail security 

--- Document Chunk 2080 ---
solutions for the future. 

--- Document Chunk 2081 ---
Security related EU projects 

--- Document Chunk 2082 ---
are developed within the 

--- Document Chunk 2083 ---
Horizon Europe Secure Society 

--- Document Chunk 2084 ---
call or DG Home Internal 

--- Document Chunk 2085 ---
Security Fund (ISF). For the 

--- Document Chunk 2086 ---
next three years, two projects 

--- Document Chunk 2087 ---
have already been selected 

--- Document Chunk 2088 ---
by the European Commission 

--- Document Chunk 2089 ---
on the development of rail 

--- Document Chunk 2090 ---
security training programmes.

--- Document Chunk 2091 ---
PARTICIPATION IN THE 

--- Document Chunk 2092 ---
REGIONAL STRATEGY

--- Document Chunk 2093 ---
The security platform is 

--- Document Chunk 2094 ---
worldwide: security is a 

--- Document Chunk 2095 ---
subject that affects all regions. 

--- Document Chunk 2096 ---
The security division is ready 

--- Document Chunk 2097 ---
to develop regional security 

--- Document Chunk 2098 ---
projects or workshops to 

--- Document Chunk 2099 ---
address main security threats 

--- Document Chunk 2100 ---
and work on security strategies 

--- Document Chunk 2101 ---
that can be developed at 

--- Document Chunk 2102 ---
regional level.

--- Document Chunk 2103 ---
The security division is 

--- Document Chunk 2104 ---
also ready to continue to 

--- Document Chunk 2105 ---
participate in training efforts, 

--- Document Chunk 2106 ---
in order to support regional 

--- Document Chunk 2107 ---
activities.

EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT MANAGEMENT

--- Document Chunk 2113 ---
More generally, UIC has successfully improved its visibility and 

--- Document Chunk 2114 ---
contribution to European projects from H2020 and Shif2Rail. 

--- Document Chunk 2115 ---
This presence is being reinforced in the current Horizon 

--- Document Chunk 2116 ---
Europe programme and Europe’s Rail, with the ambition to 

--- Document Chunk 2117 ---
be recognised as a technical force and a reliable technical 

--- Document Chunk 2118 ---
partner at European level.

--- Document Chunk 2119 ---
An organisational audit was conducted, and the first part of 

--- Document Chunk 2120 ---
the results are currently being implemented. Efficiency gains 

--- Document Chunk 2121 ---
will show their full impact in the next period.

--- Document Chunk 2122 ---
FINANCE

--- Document Chunk 2123 ---
The UIC has set up the first steps for the improvement of its 

--- Document Chunk 2124 ---
internal financial control.

--- Document Chunk 2125 ---
The objective is to gain a clearer view of each department’s 

--- Document Chunk 2126 ---
planned budget, isolating the Headquarter component from 

--- Document Chunk 2127 ---
the Project Component, in order to facilitate management 

--- Document Chunk 2128 ---
decisions.

--- Document Chunk 2129 ---
Efforts are currently being pursued to simplify the whole 

--- Document Chunk 2130 ---
accounting system and to develop the accrual performance, 

--- Document Chunk 2131 ---
with the aim of obtaining major improvements during the 

--- Document Chunk 2132 ---
year 2023.

--- Document Chunk 2133 ---
The personalised follow-up accumulated payments arrears has 

--- Document Chunk 2134 ---
been implemented with good results thanks to the commitment 

--- Document Chunk 2135 ---
of members from all UIC regions. “Absent” members have been 

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
personally approached to better understand their difficulties 

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
or their expectations. These actions have led to a better 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
understanding of the UIC added value and have boosted the 

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
momentum of their involvement and for the current year 2022 

--- Document Chunk 2140 ---
for instance, more than 600K€ have been recovered. In the 

--- Document Chunk 2141 ---
future, regional projects will be reinforced to strengthen the 

--- Document Chunk 2142 ---
direct participation of members at regional level.

--- Document Chunk 2143 ---
Concerning Projects, the projects database has strengthened 

--- Document Chunk 2144 ---
its position as a reference tool for members to follow up 

--- Document Chunk 2145 ---
the progress of UIC projects. Developments are ongoing 

--- Document Chunk 2146 ---
to improve the possibilities of targeted reporting to the 

--- Document Chunk 2147 ---
members.

--- Document Chunk 2148 ---
The next step will be to address the fragmentation of human 

--- Document Chunk 2149 ---
and capital resources for projects, by consolidating the 

--- Document Chunk 2150 ---
pooling of experts and resources towards bigger and more 

--- Document Chunk 2151 ---
ambitious projects.

QUALITY

--- Document Chunk 2155 ---
In early 2015, UIC started implementing a Quality Management 

--- Document Chunk 2156 ---
System (QMS) in order to better respond to members’ 

--- Document Chunk 2157 ---
needs for service, as a professional association. A members’ 

--- Document Chunk 2158 ---
satisfaction enquiry is undertaken every year, as one of the 

--- Document Chunk 2159 ---
tools used for measuring the key performance indicators of 

--- Document Chunk 2160 ---
the UIC activity. The enquiry’s report is shared with both the 

--- Document Chunk 2161 ---
UIC members and staff with the aim to facilitate collective 

--- Document Chunk 2162 ---
action for continuous improvement of the association’s 

--- Document Chunk 2163 ---
overall performance.

--- Document Chunk 2164 ---
In 2017, the UIC QMS was certified with the Quali’OP 

--- Document Chunk 2165 ---
label awarded by AFNOR (the French Association for 

--- Document Chunk 2166 ---
Standardisation and Certification) to professional associations 

--- Document Chunk 2167 ---
committed for quality of service; this certification has been 

--- Document Chunk 2168 ---
renewed every year since.

--- Document Chunk 2169 ---
For the following timelapse from 2023 to 2025, UIC intends to 

--- Document Chunk 2170 ---
consolidate this quality management system to help achieve 

--- Document Chunk 2171 ---
the optimum balance between the UIC’s internal capacities 

--- Document Chunk 2172 ---
and members’ expectations.

--- Document Chunk 2173 ---
In order to do so, the main focus will be on:

--- Document Chunk 2174 ---
 f Contributing to improve and consolidate the efforts of 

--- Document Chunk 2175 ---
all the UIC support services for a better quality of ser -

--- Document Chunk 2176 ---
vice towards the internal (staff) and external (members) 

--- Document Chunk 2177 ---
customers,

--- Document Chunk 2178 ---
 f Simplifying and formalising internal processes, aiming to 

--- Document Chunk 2179 ---
reach an efficient and cost-effective functioning with effi-

--- Document Chunk 2180 ---
cient, competent and well-trained staff,

--- Document Chunk 2181 ---
 f Managing a simple but efficient documentary system as 

--- Document Chunk 2182 ---
a common reference framework of coordination between 

--- Document Chunk 2183 ---
the internal (staff) and external (members) stakeholders,

--- Document Chunk 2184 ---
 f Making sure that the rules for ethical and transparent gov-

--- Document Chunk 2185 ---
ernance are respected and applied,

--- Document Chunk 2186 ---
 f Ensuring that UIC obtains further certifications in relation 

--- Document Chunk 2187 ---
to its capacities and needs.

--- Document Chunk 2188 ---
In a nutshell, the major objective of the QMS is to involve all 

--- Document Chunk 2189 ---
the concerned stakeholders to help achieve a high level of 

--- Document Chunk 2190 ---
professionalism in the UIC services and maintain it on a long-

--- Document Chunk 2191 ---
term perspective. This aims satisfying member’s expectations 

--- Document Chunk 2192 ---
on the one hand, and enabling UIC to position itself among 

--- Document Chunk 2193 ---
the credible and reliable players in the sector at international 

--- Document Chunk 2194 ---
level, on the other hand.

COMMUNICATIONS

--- Document Chunk 2199 ---
The Communications department 

--- Document Chunk 2200 ---
implements UIC’s communications 

--- Document Chunk 2201 ---
strategy in line with the Work 

--- Document Chunk 2202 ---
Programme’s five strategic focus 

--- Document Chunk 2203 ---
areas and provides each UIC body 

--- Document Chunk 2204 ---
(department or region) with a clear 

--- Document Chunk 2205 ---
vision of their strategic messages, 

--- Document Chunk 2206 ---
audiences and proposed measures 

--- Document Chunk 2207 ---
to implement their communication 

--- Document Chunk 2208 ---
actions.

--- Document Chunk 2209 ---
The department will continue to 

--- Document Chunk 2210 ---
deliver a multi-channel strategy of 

--- Document Chunk 2211 ---
different messages adapted to its 

--- Document Chunk 2212 ---
various targeted audiences, with 

--- Document Chunk 2213 ---
more emphasis placed on regional 

--- Document Chunk 2214 ---
communication and activities. This will 

--- Document Chunk 2215 ---
include the organisation of a regular 

--- Document Chunk 2216 ---
cycle of regional events to develop 

--- Document Chunk 2217 ---
activities and to give more visibility to 

--- Document Chunk 2218 ---
the UIC brand in each region.

--- Document Chunk 2219 ---
In terms of social media strategy, key 

--- Document Chunk 2220 ---
performance indicators have made it 

--- Document Chunk 2221 ---
possible to assess UIC’s communications 

--- Document Chunk 2222 ---
actions and to decide the next steps. 

--- Document Chunk 2223 ---
The promotion of activities on UIC’s 

--- Document Chunk 2224 ---
social media platforms will increase, 

--- Document Chunk 2225 ---
particularly on LinkedIn, which is UIC’s 

--- Document Chunk 2226 ---
most effective social media platform in 

--- Document Chunk 2227 ---
terms of follower growth, while internal 

--- Document Chunk 2228 ---
and external communications will be 

--- Document Chunk 2229 ---
improved through better-adapted 

--- Document Chunk 2230 ---
digital tools for sending the UIC 

--- Document Chunk 2231 ---
newsletter, marketing campaigns and 

--- Document Chunk 2232 ---
internal news updates.

--- Document Chunk 2233 ---
Having gained more visibility and 

--- Document Chunk 2234 ---
credibility in the field of events over 

--- Document Chunk 2235 ---
the last few years, the department will 

--- Document Chunk 2236 ---
implement an official events policy, 

--- Document Chunk 2237 ---
with the aim of developing a more 

--- Document Chunk 2238 ---
professional model for the organisation 

--- Document Chunk 2239 ---
of UIC events.

--- Document Chunk 2240 ---
A sponsorship policy will be put in 

--- Document Chunk 2241 ---
place, establishing a common approach 

--- Document Chunk 2242 ---
between all UIC event organisers. The 

--- Document Chunk 2243 ---
objective will be to develop a shared 

--- Document Chunk 2244 ---
database of contacts, reinforce ties 

--- Document Chunk 2245 ---
with UIC’s partners, foster relations with 

--- Document Chunk 2246 ---
potential sponsors over the long-term, 

--- Document Chunk 2247 ---
further strengthen UIC’s image and reach 

--- Document Chunk 2248 ---
out to different types of audiences.

HUMAN RESOURCES

--- Document Chunk 2252 ---
The Human Resources department 

--- Document Chunk 2253 ---
accompanies and supports UIC’s 

--- Document Chunk 2254 ---
strategy and performance, as well as 

--- Document Chunk 2255 ---
the transformation of business models 

--- Document Chunk 2256 ---
leading to changes in UIC’s activities 

--- Document Chunk 2257 ---
and operating methods.

--- Document Chunk 2258 ---
Its goal is to ensure that UIC has the staff 

--- Document Chunk 2259 ---
necessary to function and that they do 

--- Document Chunk 2260 ---
their best to improve UIC’s performance 

--- Document Chunk 2261 ---
while also flourishing.

--- Document Chunk 2262 ---
HR must take employees’ changing 

--- Document Chunk 2263 ---
expectations into account and respond 

--- Document Chunk 2264 ---
to the various and ever-increasing 

--- Document Chunk 2265 ---
challenges inherent to the current 

--- Document Chunk 2266 ---
reality of the world of work. This is why 

--- Document Chunk 2267 ---
their areas of action are increasing and 

--- Document Chunk 2268 ---
their missions are diversifying, which 

--- Document Chunk 2269 ---
means that new work organisations 

--- Document Chunk 2270 ---
and new management methods need 

--- Document Chunk 2271 ---
to be developed, in particular, taking 

--- Document Chunk 2272 ---
into account changes in flexibility and 

--- Document Chunk 2273 ---
well-being at work and environmental 

--- Document Chunk 2274 ---
and societal issues, as well as providing 

--- Document Chunk 2275 ---
support for digitalisation.

--- Document Chunk 2276 ---
HR’s strategy will enable the follows 

--- Document Chunk 2277 ---
goals to be met:

--- Document Chunk 2278 ---
 f Mobilising employees regarding the 

--- Document Chunk 2279 ---
work programme, a collaborative 

--- Document Chunk 2280 ---
project which reflects UIC’s values,

--- Document Chunk 2281 ---
 f Taking each person’s talents and 

--- Document Chunk 2282 ---
skills into account in order to 

--- Document Chunk 2283 ---
achieve UIC’s development goals as 

--- Document Chunk 2284 ---
well as to promote internal flexibil -

--- Document Chunk 2285 ---
ity and the employee’s professional 

--- Document Chunk 2286 ---
development,

--- Document Chunk 2287 ---
 f Improving processes and HR’s activ-

--- Document Chunk 2288 ---
ities throughout each level of UIC,

--- Document Chunk 2289 ---
 f Increasing the employees’ skills 

--- Document Chunk 2290 ---
through access to continued profes-

--- Document Chunk 2291 ---
sional development and promoting 

--- Document Chunk 2292 ---
skills management, while taking an 

--- Document Chunk 2293 ---
increasingly fluid and digitalised 

--- Document Chunk 2294 ---
working environment into account, 

--- Document Chunk 2295 ---
especially in light of new challeng -

--- Document Chunk 2296 ---
es, such as the spread of work from 

--- Document Chunk 2297 ---
home.

--- Document Chunk 2298 ---
In 2022, the HR Department introduced 

--- Document Chunk 2299 ---
a goal-setting review process. 2023 

--- Document Chunk 2300 ---
will see the goals being evaluated and 

--- Document Chunk 2301 ---
the commitment of employees being 

--- Document Chunk 2302 ---
recognised.

--- Document Chunk 2303 ---
The HR Department will focus on the 

--- Document Chunk 2304 ---
following initiatives:

--- Document Chunk 2305 ---
 f Staff training, including the develop-

--- Document Chunk 2306 ---
ment of project management skills,

--- Document Chunk 2307 ---
 f Work on the “employer brand” in 

--- Document Chunk 2308 ---
order to:

--- Document Chunk 2309 ---
 - help retain talented employees, 

--- Document Chunk 2310 ---
increase loyalty and get them to 

--- Document Chunk 2311 ---
commit to the company’s aims,

--- Document Chunk 2312 ---
 - increase the attractiveness of the 

--- Document Chunk 2313 ---
company is to qualified people in 

--- Document Chunk 2314 ---
order to attract new talent, under-

--- Document Chunk 2315 ---
