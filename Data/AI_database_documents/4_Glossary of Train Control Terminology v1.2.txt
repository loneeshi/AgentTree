Glossary of Train Control Terminology v1.2 

--- Document Chunk 2 ---
This glossary includes many of the terms that you will encounter in the Certificate (Module A) 

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
of the IRSE Examination.  Its focus is on commonly used acronyms and on terms where, in 

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
different countries, there are alternative names in English for the same object, role, or 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
function.  It is not a comprehensive list of all train control terminology.  It does not address 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
telecommunications terminology because this tends to be more consistent between 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
countries. 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
You are not expected to learn the descriptions in the 3rd column.  Just look down the first 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
column and check if there are any terms that you are not familiar with.  The term in the first 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
column is the one that is usually used in the examination.
