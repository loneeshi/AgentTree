1.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
1.3.1.1 Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions. 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
1.3.1.2 Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are rethinking 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which ATC systems 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce standardised systems 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
to reduce system costs. In order to establish international standardisation of ATC 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
systems, the following document specifies the European Rail Traffic Management 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS). 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
1.4.1.1 The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as: 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
• Cross border interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
• Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic. 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
• Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
• Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
exploitation of maximum track capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
• The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology. 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
• Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
components. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
world market. 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
• Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
management. 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
1.5 About this Document 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
1.5.1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
(ETCS) from a technical point of view. 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
1.5.1.2 Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a tra nsition period. They might be removed 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
in a future edition of the standard. 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
1.5.1.3 To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level.

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
1.5.1.4 For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside the 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
scope of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
1.6.1.1 The SRS covers 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
introduction. 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
1.6.1.2 All readers may need to refer to the Glossary of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET-023). 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
1.7 Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
1.7.1.1 This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the technical interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally identified as 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
containing ERTMS/ETCS on -board and/or ERTM S/ETCS trackside requirements (see 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
details in chapter 9). 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
1.7.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated requirements, 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control -Command and 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
Signalling TSI and in this SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
1.7.1.3 For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined according 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs. In any case, 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
the requirements of this SRS , which are allocated to the trackside and  related to the 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
implemented functions, shall be respected. 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
1.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
1.7.1.5 Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
generate any interoperability problems. 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
1.8 Contents of the SRS 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
1.8.1.1 The SRS defines the system requi rements for the European Train Control System 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
(ETCS) of ERTMS. 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
1.8.1.2 This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find the 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
relevant chapters. 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
1.8.2 Chapter 1: Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
1.8.2.1 Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of the 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter. 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
1.8.3 Chapter 2: Basic System Description 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
1.8.3.1 Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure. 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
1.8.3.2 Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels.

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
1.8.3.3 Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
1.8.4 Chapter 3: Principles 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
1.8.4.1 Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
onboard and trackside subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
1.8.4.2 The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms. 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
1.8.5 Chapter 4: Modes and Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all transitions 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
between modes. 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
1.8.6 Chapter 5: Procedures 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
1.8.6.1 Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
interoperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the cha rt are 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
onboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to another. 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
1.8.7 Chapter 6: Management of older System Versions 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope o f legally operated system versions and list s the 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other chapters 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used  by the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
1.8.8 Chapter 7: ERTMS/ETCS Language 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
1.8.8.1 Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is described. 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
The format of messages is given in Chapter 8. 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
1.8.9 Chapter 8: Messages 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
1.8.9.1 Chapter 8 defines the application protocol (format and content of messages, logical 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
sequence for radio) necessary to achieve technical interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
1.8.9.2 The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protoc ol and the content of 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
messages. 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
1.8.10 Chapter 9: Classification of the SRS clauses 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
1.8.10.1 Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
8 of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
1.8.10.2 In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
with the SRS, it identif ies which clauses contain requirements allocated to the

2.4 System structure 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
2.4.1.1 Due to the nature of the req uired functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system will have to be 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains. 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
2.4.1.2 This defines two subsystems, the on-board subsystem and the trackside subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
2.4.1.3 The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
a) the train  with optionally a Train Integrity Monitoring System , which will then be 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
considered in the train interface specification; 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification; 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3); 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
interoperability requirement will be established.

2.5 Subsystems 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
2.5.1 Trackside subsystem 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
2.5.1.1 Depending on the application level (see further sections), the trackside subsystem can 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
a) balise 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
b) lineside electronic unit 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
c) the radio communication network(s) (FRMCS and/or GSM-R) 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC) 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
e) Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
f) Radio infill unit 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
g) Key Management Centre (KMC) 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
h) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
2.5.1.2 Balise 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
2.5.1.2.1 The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on-board subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
2.5.1.2.2 The balise is based on the existing Eurobalise specifications. These documents are 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications. 

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
2.5.1.2.3 The balises provides the up-link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside to 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
the on-board subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
2.5.1.2.4 The balises can provide fixed messages or, when connected to a lineside electronic unit, 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
messages that can be changed. 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
2.5.1.2.5 The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
2.5.1.3 Lineside electronic unit 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
2.5.1.3.1 The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems. 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
2.5.1.4 Trackside radio communication network(s) (FRMCS and/or GSM-R) 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
2.5.1.4.1 The GSM -R radio communication network is used for the bi -directional exchange of 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
messages between on-board subsystems and RBC or radio infill units. 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
2.5.1.4.2 The FRMCS radio communication network is used for the bi -directional exchange of 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
messages between on-board subsystems and RBC.

Basic System Description 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
Page 9/25 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
2.5.1.5.1 The RBC is a computer-based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
on basis of information received from external trackside systems and on basis of 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
information exchanged with the on-board subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
2.5.1.5.2 The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the responsibility of the 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
2.5.1.5.3 The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
between the RBC and the on-board subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
2.5.1.5.4 The RBC can be interfaced to the FRMCS and/or GSM-R radio communication 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
network(s). 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
2.5.1.6 Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
2.5.1.6.1 The Euroloop subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction. 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
2.5.1.6.2 The Euroloop subsystem is composed of an on -board functionality and by one or more 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
trackside parts.  

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
2.5.1.7 Radio infill Unit 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
2.5.1.7.1 The RADIO INFILL subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
in advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction. 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
2.5.1.7.2 The RADIO INFILL subsystem is composed of an on -board functionality and by one or 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
more trackside parts (named RADIO INFILL Unit). 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
2.5.1.8 KMC 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
2.5.1.8.1 The role of the KMC is to manage the cryptographic keys, which are used to secure the

2.6 Levels and transitions 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
2.6.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
2.6.1.1 The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related to 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
equipment respectively.  

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
2.6.1.2 Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their strategies, 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance. Furthermore, the 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
different application levels permit the interfacing of individual signalling systems and train 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
control systems to ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
2.6.1.3 For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
used for operation on non-equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines equipped with train control 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.  

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
2.6.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
2.6.2.1 A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment always co -operates with the 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level. 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
2.6.2.2 All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules. 

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
2.6.2.3 ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels: 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
• ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
equipped with any train control system  (ERTMS/ETCS or national system ) or on a 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under their 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
supervision is currently not possible) 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
• ERTMS/ETCS Level NTC (train equi pped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
equipped with a national system) 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
• ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
Euroloop or Radio infill) 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
• ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and Euroradio) 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
with train detection and train separation performed by the Radio Block Centre based 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
on information received from the train and/or by  other trackside equipment outside 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
the scope of ERTMS/ETCS

1 or 2. Other examples might be a station which is shared by trains arriving over level 1

2.6.3 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
2.6.3.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
2.6.3.1.1 Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or national 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not possible (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
commissioning or on-board/trackside failed components). 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
2.6.3.1.2 In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and therefore 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give movement 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
authorities to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
2.6.3.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment provides no supervision except of the  maximum 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas. 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
2.6.3.1.4 Train detection and train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside the scope 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
2.6.3.1.5 Level 0 uses no track-train transmission except Eurobalises to announce/command level 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except certain 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
special commands are interpreted. 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
2.6.3.1.6 No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
equipped area and to supervise maximum train speed.

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
2.6.4.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
2.6.4.1.1 Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with national 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
train control and speed supervision systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
2.6.4.1.2 Train control information generated trackside by the national train contro l system is 

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national 

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
system. 

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
2.6.4.1.3 Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the performance 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
and functionality of the underlying systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
2.6.4.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
2.6.4.1.5 The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
national systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1076 ---
2.6.4.1.6 Train detection and train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the 

--- Document Chunk 1077 ---
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) a nd are outside the scope 

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
2.6.4.1.7 Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track-train information except to announce/command 

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
level transitions and specific commands related to balise transmission. Eurobalises 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
therefore still have to be read. 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
2.6.4.1.8 The information dis played to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
national system. The active national system is indicated to the driver as part of that 

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a level 

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
transition position and to supervise maximum train speed. 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
2.6.4.1.9 A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level. 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
2.6.4.1.10 Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, in 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
order to perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give access 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through a device

2.6.5 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
2.6.5.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 1146 ---
2.6.5.1.1 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as 

--- Document Chunk 1147 ---
an overlay on an underlying signalling system. 

--- Document Chunk 1148 ---
2.6.5.1.2 Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via  

--- Document Chunk 1149 ---
Eurobalises. 

--- Document Chunk 1150 ---
2.6.5.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 

--- Document Chunk 1151 ---
protects against overrun of the authority. 

--- Document Chunk 1152 ---
2.6.5.1.4 Train detection and train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the 

--- Document Chunk 1153 ---
underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are outside  the scope 

--- Document Chunk 1154 ---
of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1155 ---
2.6.5.1.5 Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices. 

--- Document Chunk 1156 ---
2.6.5.1.6 The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information. 

--- Document Chunk 1157 ---
2.6.5.1.7 If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this information 

--- Document Chunk 1158 ---
until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has to observe 

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be permitted to 

--- Document Chunk 1160 ---
approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 1161 ---
2.6.5.1.8 Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill 

--- Document Chunk 1162 ---
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.  

--- Document Chunk 1163 ---
2.6.5.1.9 Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi-continuous infill 

--- Document Chunk 1164 ---
is provided. 

--- Document Chunk 1165 ---
2.6.5.1.10 Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the on-

--- Document Chunk 1166 ---
board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is available 

--- Document Chunk 1167 ---
and even at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
2.6.5.1.11 Euroloop or radio infill can improv e the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the 

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
operation without release speed.

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
2.6.6.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
2.6.6.1.1 ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 is a radio based train control system which provides full cab 

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
signalling and does not require lineside signals. 

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
2.6.6.1.1.1 Note: Lineside signals can still be implemented in ERTMS/ETCS level 2. 

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
2.6.6.1.2 Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via 

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
Euroradio. 

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
2.6.6.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
protects against overrun of the authority. 

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
2.6.6.1.4 Train detection and train separation can be performed by the Radio Block Centre (in co-

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
operation with the train which sends position reports and train integrity information) 

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
and/or by other trackside equipment (interlocking, track circuits etc.), outside the scope 

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
2.6.6.1.5 Level 2 is based on Euroradio for track to train communication and on Eurobalises as 

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
spot transmission devices mainly for location referencing. 

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
2.6.6.1.6 The trackside radio block centre which provides the information to the trains knows each 

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
ERTMS/ETCS controlled train individually by the ERTMS/ETCS identity of its leading 

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

3.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 1902 ---
3.3.1 Scope and purpose 

--- Document Chunk 1903 ---
3.3.1.1 The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These 

--- Document Chunk 1904 ---
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
3.3.1.2 The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
and functional terms. 

--- Document Chunk 1907 ---
3.3.1.3 The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several 

--- Document Chunk 1908 ---
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification 

--- Document Chunk 1909 ---
number. 

--- Document Chunk 1910 ---
3.3.1.4 Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as 

--- Document Chunk 1911 ---
requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1912 ---
3.4 Balise configuration, linking and Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 1913 ---
3.4.1 Balise Configurations – Balise Group Definition 

--- Document Chunk 1914 ---
3.4.1.1 A balise group consists of between one and eight balises sharing the same balise group 

--- Document Chunk 1915 ---
identity. 

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---
3.4.1.2 In every balise, the following information is at least stored: 

--- Document Chunk 1917 ---
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 1918 ---
b) The number of balises inside the group 

--- Document Chunk 1919 ---
c) The balise group identity. 

--- Document Chunk 1920 ---
3.4.1.3 The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the group. 

--- Document Chunk 1921 ---
3.4.2 Balise Co-ordinate System 

--- Document Chunk 1922 ---
3.4.2.1.1 Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system. 

--- Document Chunk 1923 ---
3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co -ordinate system of a balise group is defined by the  nominal 

--- Document Chunk 1924 ---
direction (see 3.4.2.2.2) and is identified as balise group orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 1925 ---
3.4.2.2 Balise groups composed of two or more balises 

--- Document Chunk 1926 ---
3.4.2.2.1 The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise number 

--- Document Chunk 1927 ---
1 (called location reference) in the balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1928 ---
3.4.2.2.1.1 Exception: If the balise number 1 of the group is duplicated, the balise number 2 shall be 

--- Document Chunk 1929 ---
the location reference in case, out of this pair of duplicated balises, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1930 ---
on-board equipment has only received the telegram from the balise number 2.

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
balise group received, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is available 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
to identify the orientation of the co -ordinate system of this single balise group, the 

--- Document Chunk 2007 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position by means of a position report 

--- Document Chunk 2008 ---
based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG and the 

--- Document Chunk 2009 ---
“previous LRBG”, if any. 

--- Document Chunk 2010 ---
3.4.2.3.3.1.1 Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC o f the need to assign a 

--- Document Chunk 2011 ---
co-ordinate system to this single balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2012 ---
3.4.2.3.3.2 When a single balise group is received and the previous LRBG is known, the position 

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move from the  

--- Document Chunk 2014 ---
“previous LRBG” towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG): directional 

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
information in the position report pointing in the same direction as the direction reference 

--- Document Chunk 2016 ---
shall be reported as “nominal”, otherwise as “reverse”. 

--- Document Chunk 2017 ---
3.4.2.3.3.3 If the “previous LRBG “ is not known, the “previous LRBG” and all directional information 

--- Document Chunk 2018 ---

additionally from Euroloops or Radio Infill Units (see section 3.9). In level 2, balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 2128 ---
are mostly used for location information. 

--- Document Chunk 2129 ---
3.4.3.2 In level 1, t he balise information can be of the following type (please refer to section s 

--- Document Chunk 2130 ---
3.6.2.3 and 3.8.5): 

--- Document Chunk 2131 ---
a) Non-infill 

--- Document Chunk 2132 ---
b) Intentionally deleted

c) Infill. 

--- Document Chunk 2134 ---
3.4.3.2.1 Intentionally deleted.

3.4.3.2.2 Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
3.4.3.3 Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information 

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received informatio n). If such information is 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of at 

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
least two balises shall be used.

3.4.4 Linking 

--- Document Chunk 2141 ---
3.4.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 2142 ---
3.4.4.1.1 Aim of linking:  

--- Document Chunk 2143 ---
• To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not received within the 

--- Document Chunk 2144 ---
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action.  

--- Document Chunk 2145 ---
• To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise. 

--- Document Chunk 2146 ---
• To perform the relocation of location based information without any consideration of 

--- Document Chunk 2147 ---
the odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4). 

--- Document Chunk 2148 ---
3.4.4.1.2 A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is k nown in 

--- Document Chunk 2149 ---
advance. 

--- Document Chunk 2150 ---
3.4.4.1.2.1 Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked 

--- Document Chunk 2151 ---
also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains 

--- Document Chunk 2152 ---
repositioning information marked accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 2153 ---
3.4.4.2 Content of linking information 

--- Document Chunk 2154 ---
3.4.4.2.1 Linking information shall be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 2155 ---
a) The identity of the linked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2156 ---
b) Where the location reference of the group is. 

--- Document Chunk 2157 ---
c) The accuracy of this location.

Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define 

--- Document Chunk 2170 ---
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises. 

--- Document Chunk 2171 ---
d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or 

--- Document Chunk 2172 ---
reverse). 

--- Document Chunk 2173 ---
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the linked balise 

--- Document Chunk 2174 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 2175 ---
3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking consistency is checked" shall be interpreted as when: 

--- Document Chunk 2176 ---
a) linking information is stored on-board, AND 

--- Document Chunk 2177 ---
b) depending on the mode the linking consistency check is active, AND 

--- Document Chunk 2178 ---
c) the supervision of the expectation window of the furthest announced balise group has 

--- Document Chunk 2179 ---
not yet been stopped (see 3.4.4.4.6). 

--- Document Chunk 2180 ---
3.4.4.2.2 Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following 

--- Document Chunk 2181 ---
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information. 

--- Document Chunk 2182 ---
3.4.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 2183 ---
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2. 

--- Document Chunk 2184 ---
3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known because 

--- Document Chunk 2185 ---
the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2186 ---
3.4.4.2.3 For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to 

--- Document Chunk 2187 ---
be used in case of data inconsistencies: 

--- Document Chunk 2188 ---
a) Train trip  (Trip mode, see Chapter 4) 

--- Document Chunk 2189 ---
b) Command service brake  

--- Document Chunk 2190 ---
c) No reaction

3.4.4.3 Unlinked Balise Groups 

--- Document Chunk 2193 ---
3.4.4.3.1 A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the balise 

--- Document Chunk 2194 ---
group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.  

--- Document Chunk 2195 ---
3.4.4.3.2 Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.   

--- Document Chunk 2196 ---
3.4.4.3.3 Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier. 

--- Document Chunk 2197 ---
3.4.4.4 Rules applicable to balise groups when linking consistency is checked 

--- Document Chunk 2198 ---
3.4.4.4.1 "Expected balise group" shall be interpreted as an announced balise group whose 

--- Document Chunk 2199 ---
expectation window is currently supervised by the on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 2200 ---
3.4.4.4.2 When the expected balise group is referred in the linking information with a balise group

--- Document Chunk 2217 ---
any balise group marked as linked unless: 

--- Document Chunk 2218 ---
a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientat ion of the linked balise group by 

--- Document Chunk 2219 ---
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single balise 

--- Document Chunk 2220 ---
groups), AND 

--- Document Chunk 2221 ---
b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, AND 

--- Document Chunk 2222 ---
c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information. 

--- Document Chunk 2223 ---
3.4.4.4.2.2 Balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken into account. 

--- Document Chunk 2224 ---
3.4.4.4.3 For each  balise group marked as linked and included in the linking information , the 

--- Document Chunk 2225 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check whether  the balise giving the location 

--- Document Chunk 2226 ---
reference of the group was detected (see SUBSET-036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2) 

--- Document Chunk 2227 ---
within its expectation window starting 

--- Document Chunk 2228 ---
• when the max safe antenna position has passed the first possible location of the 

--- Document Chunk 2229 ---

and ending 

--- Document Chunk 2231 ---
• when the min safe antenna position has passed the last possible location of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 2232 ---

--- Document Chunk 2233 ---
3.4.4.4.3.1 The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group are defined 

--- Document Chunk 2234 ---
by the linking distance and the location accuracy of the expected balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2235 ---
3.4.4.4.3.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall reject the message from a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 2236 ---
whose location reference is detected outside its expectation window or whose location 

--- Document Chunk 2237 ---
reference is received while its expectation window is no longer supervised. 

--- Document Chunk 2238 ---
3.4.4.4.4 In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location 

--- Document Chunk 2239 ---
shall be the reference location of the previously linked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2240 ---
3.4.4.4.5 The on -board equipment shall supervise only one expectation window at a time 

--- Document Chunk 2241 ---
according to the order given by linking information and starting with the first announced 

--- Document Chunk 2242 ---
balise group in advance of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 2243 ---
3.4.4.4.5.1 Upon reception of new linking information and after the replacement of previously stored 

--- Document Chunk 2244 ---
linking information (if any), the first announced balise group in advance of the train shall 

--- Document Chunk 2245 ---
be determined by the on -board equipment as the first one in the resulting linking

further next balise group announced in the linking information. 

--- Document Chunk 2271 ---
3.4.4.4.6.2 Note: 3.4.4.4.6 a) implies that in case a balise group composed of more than one balise

3.4.5.1.1 The End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) information is transmitted only by balise groups. 

--- Document Chunk 2286 ---
3.4.5.1.2 The balise group transmitting the EOLM information marks the beginning of a track area

--- Document Chunk 2289 ---
3.4.5.1.3 The following information is included in the EOLM: 

--- Document Chunk 2290 ---
• Loop identity used to identify the loop. 

--- Document Chunk 2291 ---
• Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop messages. 

--- Document Chunk 2292 ---
• Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where

the loop is installed. 

--- Document Chunk 2294 ---
• Length of the loop. 

--- Document Chunk 2295 ---
• Indicator telling the on -board whe ther the orientation of the loop (i.e. its nominal

shall delete the EOLM information as soon as the loop antenna position is outside the 

--- Document Chunk 2318 ---
loop area, taking into account the min safe antenna position in case of movement in the

Euroloop if the loop identity referred in the loop message matches the loop identity 

--- Document Chunk 2324 ---
referred in the EOLM information stored on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 2325 ---
3.4.5.2.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start accepting messages from the

3.5.3.7 The establishment of a communication session shall be performed ac cording to the 

--- Document Chunk 2445 ---
following steps: 

--- Document Chunk 2446 ---
a) The on-board shall request the set-up of a safe radio connection with the trackside. If 

--- Document Chunk 2447 ---
this request is part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure  or is related to the 

--- Document Chunk 2448 ---
establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c ), it shall be 

--- Document Chunk 2449 ---
repeated until successful or a defined number of times (see Appendix A.3.1). 

--- Document Chunk 2450 ---
If this request is not part of an ongoing Start of Mission procedure  and is not related 

--- Document Chunk 2451 ---
to the establishment of a communication session due to condition 3.5.3.4 c) , it shall 

--- Document Chunk 2452 ---
be repeated until successful. 

--- Document Chunk 2453 ---
A request shall be repeated immediately after EURORADIO has indicated that setting 

--- Document Chunk 2454 ---
up the safe radio connection has failed. 

--- Document Chunk 2455 ---
b) As soon as the safe radio connection is set-up, the on-board shall send the message 

--- Document Chunk 2456 ---
Initiation of communication session to the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 2457 ---
c) As soon as the trackside receives the information, it shall send the system version. 

--- Document Chunk 2458 ---
d) When the on-board receives the system version it shall consider the communication 

--- Document Chunk 2459 ---
session established and: 

--- Document Chunk 2460 ---
• If one of its supported system versions is compatible with the one sent by 

--- Document Chunk 2461 ---
trackside, it shall send a session established report, including its supported system 

--- Document Chunk 2462 ---
versions, to the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 2463 ---
• If none of its supported system versions is compatible with the one sent by 

--- Document Chunk 2464 ---
trackside, it shall send a version independent message indicating “No compatible 

--- Document Chunk 2465 ---
version supported”. It shall inform the driver and shall terminate the 

--- Document Chunk 2466 ---
communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 2467 ---
e) When the trackside receives the session established report or the information that no 

--- Document Chunk 2468 ---
compatible system version is supported by the on -board, it shall consider the 

--- Document Chunk 2469 ---
communication session established. Upon reception of a session established report, 

--- Document Chunk 2470 ---
the trackside shall acknowledge the establishment of the communication session to 

--- Document Chunk 2471 ---
the on-board.

3.5.3.7.1 Regarding a), if both radio systems are installed on-board it shall request the set-up of a 

--- Document Chunk 2506 ---
safe radio connection according to the following (by priority order): 

--- Document Chunk 2507 ---
1) In case of order received from tracks ide, depending on whether the order relates 

--- Document Chunk 2508 ---
to an RBC interfaced with FRMCS only, OR 

--- Document Chunk 2509 ---
2) If the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R and if during the SoM the 

--- Document Chunk 2510 ---
driver has elected to perform the mission with only one radio system, by using 

--- Document Chunk 2511 ---
either the FRMCS o n-board equipment or a GSM -R Mobile Terminal, depending 

--- Document Chunk 2512 ---
on the radio system to which the registration was successful during the SoM, OR 

--- Document Chunk 2513 ---
3) According to the stored Radio Network information (Radio Network type and, if 

--- Document Chunk 2514 ---
relevant, GSM-R Radio Network ID). If the Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM-

--- Document Chunk 2515 ---
R, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall use, if available, the preferred radio system 

--- Document Chunk 2516 ---
stored when establishing the previous communication session with the RBC (see 

--- Document Chunk 2517 ---
SUBSET-037-1 for details) 

--- Document Chunk 2518 ---
3.5.3.7.2 Regarding b), if both radio systems are installed on-board it shall store the radio system 

--- Document Chunk 2519 ---
through which the safe radio connection is successfully set up. 

--- Document Chunk 2520 ---
3.5.3.7.3 Exception to d): when the on -board does not receive the system version within a fixed 

--- Document Chunk 2521 ---

3.5.3.7.4 Regarding e), in case the on-board has sent a session established report: when the on-

--- Document Chunk 2535 ---
board does not receive an acknowledgement of the establishment of the communication 

--- Document Chunk 2536 ---
session within a fixed waiting time (see A.3.1), it shall again send a session established

session establishment is still not received within the fixed waiting time, the on-board shall 

--- Document Chunk 2540 ---
terminate the communication session and re-establish a new one. 

--- Document Chunk 2541 ---
3.5.3.7.5 Exception to e): If the trackside receives  a "Termination of communication session"

3.5.4.1 When a communication session is established , in case of a loss of the safe radio 

--- Document Chunk 2601 ---
connection, i.e., if the disconnection has not been ordered (see 3.5.5.1), the involved 

--- Document Chunk 2602 ---
entities shall consider the communication session still established for a defined time. The 

--- Document Chunk 2603 ---
defined time shall start as soon as EURORADIO has indicated the loss of the safe radio 

--- Document Chunk 2604 ---
connection. 

--- Document Chunk 2605 ---
3.5.4.2 When EURORADIO indicates the loss of the safe radio connection, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 2606 ---
on-board equipment shall immediately try to s et-up a new safe radio connection  using 

--- Document Chunk 2607 ---
the radio system through which the safe radio connection was successfully set up 

--- Document Chunk 2608 ---
beforehand (see SUBSET-037-1 for details). 

--- Document Chunk 2609 ---
3.5.4.2.1 If the safe radio connection is not re -established after the defined time (as defined in

terminated. 

--- Document Chunk 2612 ---
3.5.4.3 The attempts shall be repeated, until at least one of the following conditions is met:

transitions between networks, which permits e.g. to not interrupt a r adio connection on 

--- Document Chunk 2742 ---
passing an international border where FRMCS is installed on both sides of the border. 

--- Document Chunk 2743 ---
3.5.6.1.3 Note 2:  As soon as it is powered -up, the FRMCS on -board equipment reports 

--- Document Chunk 2744 ---
continuously to the ETCS on -board equipment whether it is registered or not t o the 

--- Document Chunk 2745 ---
FRMCS radio network, i.e. that it is ready or not to establish a radio connection with an 

--- Document Chunk 2746 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 2747 ---
3.5.6.2 When powered-off, ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall memorize the last received 

--- Document Chunk 2748 ---
Radio Network type and GSM -R Radio Network identity if any (from trackside or from 

--- Document Chunk 2749 ---
driver) and shall use it (them) when powered-up again. 

--- Document Chunk 2750 ---
3.5.6.3 If no GSM-R Radio Network identity re ceived from trackside or from driver could have 

--- Document Chunk 2751 ---
been memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or 

--- Document Chunk 2752 ---
at very first power -up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 2753 ---
Terminal(s) to a default GSM-R Radio Network. 

--- Document Chunk 2754 ---
3.5.6.3.1 Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default GSM-R Radio Network identity (on-board 

--- Document Chunk 2755 ---
equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is 

--- Document Chunk 2756 ---
implementation dependent.  

--- Document Chunk 2757 ---
3.5.6.3.2 Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is powered-up in an area not covered by 

--- Document Chunk 2758 ---
the memorized or default GSM-R Radio Network, attempts to register to this Radio 

--- Document Chunk 2759 ---
Network will be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt 

--- Document Chunk 2760 ---
is successful or a new GSM-R Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from 

--- Document Chunk 2761 ---
driver, preventing Mobile Term inal(s) from registering to any unwanted GSM-R Radio 

--- Document Chunk 2762 ---
Network.

3.5.7 Safe Radio Connection Indication 

--- Document Chunk 2822 ---
3.5.7.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the 

--- Document Chunk 2823 ---
safe radio connection. To that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe radio 

--- Document Chunk 2824 ---
connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set-Up failed”, “Connection 

--- Document Chunk 2825 ---
Up”. 

--- Document Chunk 2826 ---
3.5.7.2 In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use a “connection status” timer 

--- Document Chunk 2827 ---
(see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication status 

--- Document Chunk 2828 ---
“Connection Lost/Set-Up failed”. 

--- Document Chunk 2829 ---
3.5.7.2.1 Note: The purpose of the “connection status” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for 

--- Document Chunk 2830 ---
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection. 

--- Document Chunk 2831 ---
3.5.7.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as soon 

--- Document Chunk 2832 ---
as the first request to set-up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is sent: 

--- Document Chunk 2833 ---
a) regarding the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4. 

--- Document Chunk 2834 ---
b) regarding maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4 

--- Document Chunk 2835 ---
3.5.7.4 If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the requests to set-up a 

--- Document Chunk 2836 ---
safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 2837 ---
3.5.7.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the 

--- Document Chunk 2838 ---
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as 

--- Document Chunk 2839 ---

--- Document Chunk 2889 ---
3.5.7.6 For the case of an RBC/RBC transition, the safe radio connection indicated to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 2890 ---
shall switch from the indication status of the safe radio connection with the Handing over 

--- Document Chunk 2891 ---
RBC to the one with the Accepting RBC as soon as one of the following conditions is 

--- Document Chunk 2892 ---
met: 

--- Document Chunk 2893 ---
a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report directly to the 

--- Document Chunk 2894 ---
Accepting RBC wi th its maximum safe front end having passed the border, see 

--- Document Chunk 2895 ---
3.15.1.3.5 (i.e. the Accepting RBC becomes the supervising RBC), 

--- Document Chunk 2896 ---
b) the safe radio connection is released with the Handing over RBC and the minimum 

--- Document Chunk 2897 ---
safe rear end of the train has passed the border. 

--- Document Chunk 2898 ---
3.5.7.6.1 Note: During an RBC/RBC handover procedure, an indication status transition table and 

--- Document Chunk 2899 ---
a connection status timer might have to be managed at the same time, for each RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 2900 ---
3.5.7.7 For the case of safe radio connection with RIU’s, the safe radio connection indicated to  

--- Document Chunk 2901 ---
the driver shall be the one related to the current infill area.

3.6 Location Principles, Train Position and Train Orientation 

--- Document Chunk 2903 ---
3.6.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 2904 ---
3.6.1.1 Two types of location based information are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 2905 ---
a) Information that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level 

--- Document Chunk 2906 ---
transition orders, linking) 

--- Document Chunk 2907 ---
b) Information that remains valid for a certain distance, referred to as Profile data (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 2908 ---
SSP, gradient).

3.6.1.3 The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to a 

--- Document Chunk 2931 ---
reference balise group, which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group) in case 

--- Document Chunk 2932 ---
the balise group is marked as linked and may be used for reporting the train position to 

--- Document Chunk 2933 ---
the RBC (i.e. the balise group is LRBG compliant, see 3.6.2.2.2 a)), and/or in relation to 

--- Document Chunk 2934 ---
other reference balise group s, which are called ORBGs (Other Reference Balise 

--- Document Chunk 2935 ---
Groups). 

--- Document Chunk 2936 ---
It includes for each of the reference balise groups (LRBG/ORBGs): 

--- Document Chunk 2937 ---
• The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between the 

--- Document Chunk 2938 ---
LRBG/ORBG and the front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 2939 ---
• The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4.1) 

--- Document Chunk 2940 ---
• Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation (see 

--- Document Chunk 2941 ---
3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG/ORBG, regarding: 

--- Document Chunk 2942 ---
− the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the 

--- Document Chunk 2943 ---
LRBG/ORBG) 

--- Document Chunk 2944 ---
− the train orientation  

--- Document Chunk 2945 ---
− the train running direction 

--- Document Chunk 2946 ---
The ORBGs are at least the seven previous LRBGs last reported to the RBC, which 

--- Document Chunk 2947 ---
may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing location dependent information 

--- Document Chunk 2948 ---
(see 3.6.2.2.2 c)), the balise groups used as reference by information stored in any 

--- Document Chunk 2949 ---
of the transition buffers (see section 4.8), and either the last passed balise group 

--- Document Chunk 2950 ---
marked as unlinked or the last two passed balise groups marked as unlinked if there 

--- Document Chunk 2951 ---
is no balise group marked as linked in between. 

--- Document Chunk 2952 ---
3.6.1.3.1 Note: the train position information in relation to an ORBG is necessary to relocate all 

--- Document Chunk 2953 ---
location based information to the Single On-board Location Reference (SOLR), in case 

--- Document Chunk 2954 ---
no linking distance can be used (see section 3.6.4.2).

a reference (in the following termed as LRBGRBC). At a certain moment LRBGRBC and 

--- Document Chunk 3034 ---
LRBGONB can be different.

--- Document Chunk 3299 ---
3.6.4.1 Train Position Confidence Interval 

--- Document Chunk 3300 ---
3.6.4.1.1 The confidence interval to the train position refers to the distance to the reference balise 

--- Document Chunk 3301 ---
group and takes into account 

--- Document Chunk 3302 ---
a) On-board over-reading amount and under -reading amount , which include among 

--- Document Chunk 3303 ---
other things the odometer accuracy and the error in detection of  the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 3304 ---
location reference. 

--- Document Chunk 3305 ---
b) The location accuracy of the reference balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 3306 ---
3.6.4.1.2 Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the 

--- Document Chunk 3307 ---
reference balise group depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 3308 ---
3.6.4.1.3 The value of the Locatio n Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information when it 

--- Document Chunk 3309 ---
becomes available, or, if it has not been previously determined by Linking information 

--- Document Chunk 3310 ---
when the balise group becomes LRBG or ORBG , by the corresponding National Value 

--- Document Chunk 3311 ---
or the corresponding Default Value if the National Value is not applicable. 

--- Document Chunk 3312 ---
3.6.4.1.4 Once the location accuracy of a balise group has been determined according to the 

--- Document Chunk 3313 ---
clause 3.6.4.1.3, it shall not be updated (e.g. neither upon reception of further Linking

--- Document Chunk 3316 ---
3.6.4.1.5 The confidence interval to the train front end position shall be delimited by: 

--- Document Chunk 3317 ---
a) The min(imum) safe front end position, which is in rear (in relation to the orientation 

--- Document Chunk 3318 ---

3.6.4.2.1 The relocation consists in changing the reference location of all location based

--- Document Chunk 3352 ---

3.6.4.2.2.3 Note: the SOLR is generally equal to the LRBG ONB. For some cases however, like the 

--- Document Chunk 3392 ---
transition to level 1/2 area, it might be possible that the linking information released from 

--- Document Chunk 3393 ---
the transition buffer provokes the change of SOLR to a former LRBG in case this 

--- Document Chunk 3394 ---
information does not announce every balise group in rear of the border (see Figure 13e). 

--- Document Chunk 3395 ---
3.6.4.2.3 Before it can be relocated, all location based information received from trackside shall 

--- Document Chunk 3396 ---
be first processed by the on -board equipment into a series of indivi dual location items 

--- Document Chunk 3397 ---
each of them being referred to an individual distance to the reference balise group of the

Signalling related speed 

--- Document Chunk 3500 ---
restriction from an infill device 

--- Document Chunk 3501 ---
start Not relevant 

--- Document Chunk 3502 ---
Justification: The signalling speed restriction received by infill MA can only be 

--- Document Chunk 3503 ---
accepted if the infill reference is known by linking with known ID . Moreover, 

--- Document Chunk 3504 ---
SOLR at that time is also part of linking, because the existence of BG(s) 

--- Document Chunk 3505 ---
announced by linking provokes a change of SOLR by 3.6.4.2.2a . A s a 

--- Document Chunk 3506 ---
consequence, the start location of this infill signalling speed restriction is always 

--- Document Chunk 3507 ---
relocated through linking distance as per 3.6.4.2.5a, so that its classification as 

--- Document Chunk 3508 ---
"min", "max" or "estimated" location item has no influence.

Table 2a: Correspondence between location items and 

--- Document Chunk 4308 ---
clauses in the ETCS specifications using them 

--- Document Chunk 4309 ---
3.6.4.2.4.1 Note 1: an individual location based information can be classified as several types of 

--- Document Chunk 4310 ---
location items. For example, the EOA location is an "estimated" location item to define 

--- Document Chunk 4311 ---
SBD foot, a "min" location item to provoke entry into Trip mode and a "max" location item 

--- Document Chunk 4312 ---
if it defines the SvL. As a second example, a single TSR encompasses two locat ion 

--- Document Chunk 4313 ---
items, i.e. a "max" location item at its start location and a "min" location item at its end 

--- Document Chunk 4314 ---
location. Classification of TSR location item, as true for any Speed Restriction, is 

--- Document Chunk 4315 ---
indirectly deduced from the fact that V_MRSP is obtained with the min safe front end and 

--- Document Chunk 4316 ---
the max safe front end of the train as per clause 3.13.10.2.8. 

--- Document Chunk 4317 ---
3.6.4.2.4.2 Note 2: in general (but not necessarily for all the functions), an “estimated”/”min”/”max” 

--- Document Chunk 4318 ---
location item is used to apply a clause when this latter involves a comparison against the 

--- Document Chunk 4319 ---
estimated front end position/min safe rear end position or the min safe antenna position/ 

--- Document Chunk 4320 ---
max safe front end position or the max safe antenna position. 

--- Document Chunk 4321 ---
3.6.4.2.4.3 Note 3: as long as linking distance(s) can be used to perform the relocation, several 

--- Document Chunk 4322 ---
items associated to a given location based information will be referred with the same 

--- Document Chunk 4323 ---
distance to the SOLR by the on -board. Otherwise, these location items (e.g. “min”, 

--- Document Chunk 4324 ---
“estimated” and “max” MA section ends) will be referred to the SOLR with different 

--- Document Chunk 4325 ---
distances, after a relocation as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 b) or c) has taken place.

3.6.4.2.5 When a balise group becomes the SOLR or when evaluating (see section 4.8) location 

--- Document Chunk 4338 ---
based trackside information, which is referred to a balise group different from the SOLR, 

--- Document Chunk 4339 ---
every location item shall be relocated to the SOLR by subtracting from the distance to its 

--- Document Chunk 4340 ---
former reference balise group (FRBG): 

--- Document Chunk 4341 ---
a) the distance between the FRBG and the SOLR, retrieved from linking information if it 

--- Document Chunk 4342 ---
is available and known (i.e. no linking distance to a repositioning balise group being 

--- Document Chunk 4343 ---
encountered between these balise groups) and, if any, the last relocation of this

b) if the last relocation of this location item has been performed as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 

--- Document Chunk 4346 ---
c) towards a BG not received earlier than the reference BG of this location item, the 

--- Document Chunk 4347 ---
distance between the FRBG and the SOLR retrieved from link ing information if it is 

--- Document Chunk 4348 ---
available and known (i.e. no linking distance to a repositioning balise group being

--- Document Chunk 4350 ---

--- Document Chunk 4351 ---
• diminished by twice the location accuracy of the FRBG, for "min" location items, 

--- Document Chunk 4352 ---

--- Document Chunk 4353 ---
items, OR 

--- Document Chunk 4354 ---
c) in all other cases, the estimated , min or max  travelled distance between the FRBG

and the SOLR, computed as per clauses 3.6.1.3 and 3.6.4.1. 5 from train fro nt end 

--- Document Chunk 4356 ---
positions in reference to FRBG and to SOLR, as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 4357 ---
• (estimated front end position against FRBG – estimated front end position 

--- Document Chunk 4358 ---
against SOLR) for "estimated" location items, 

--- Document Chunk 4359 ---
• (min safe front end position against FRBG – min safe front end position against 

--- Document Chunk 4360 ---
SOLR) for "min" location items, 

--- Document Chunk 4361 ---
• (max safe front end position against FRBG – max safe front end position against 

--- Document Chunk 4362 ---
SOLR) for "max" location items. 

--- Document Chunk 4363 ---
3.6.4.2.5.1 Note 1: For infill information or when evaluating information from a balise group marked 

--- Document Chunk 4364 ---
as unlinked while linking consistency is checked, the distances used for relocation will 

--- Document Chunk 4365 ---
always be negative and will result in an increase of the supervised distances to the 

--- Document Chunk 4366 ---
location items (because they are relocated back to the SOLR). 

--- Document Chunk 4367 ---
3.6.4.2.5.2 Note 2: The FRBG can be the former S OLR, a balise group that does not become the 

--- Document Chunk 4368 ---
SOLR (e.g. an unlinked balise group while linking consistency is checked), a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 4369 ---
that has transmitted information that has been stored in the transition buffer , the LRBG 

--- Document Chunk 4370 ---
used in an RBC message or an infill location reference. 

--- Document Chunk 4371 ---
3.6.4.2.5.3 Note 3: All reference balise groups that are used in clause 3.6.4.2.5 are listed in Train 

--- Document Chunk 4372 ---
Position defined in 3.6.1.3. Furthermore, the list of the location items that was relocated 

--- Document Chunk 4373 ---
as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 c) needs also to be memorised to apply this clause 3.6.4.2.5. 

--- Document Chunk 4374 ---
3.6.4.2.5.4 Note 4: By principle, the relocation from former SOLR to new SOLR done by clause 

--- Document Chunk 4375 ---
3.6.4.2.5 c) has no effect on the supervision of the location items, because the same

change of distances within the Train Position is applied inversely to the distances of the

--- Document Chunk 4389 ---
3.6.4.2.5.5 Note 5: The supervision of distances on -board will always be safe using these rules, 

--- Document Chunk 4390 ---
together with the SUBSET -040 §4.6.1.1 rule as prerequisite. If the trackside wants to 

--- Document Chunk 4391 ---
increase the performance, it is  its responsibility to provide linking in due course or to 

--- Document Chunk 4392 ---
repeat the location based information in reference to further balise groups. 

--- Document Chunk 4393 ---
3.6.4.2.6 Regarding the continuous profiles (i.e. SSP and gradient): if a relocation as per clause 

--- Document Chunk 4394 ---
3.6.4.2.5 b) or c) results in at least one change of value being relocated in rear of one or 

--- Document Chunk 4395 ---
more preceding change(s) of  value, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 4396 ---
recompose the continuous profile according to the following steps: 

--- Document Chunk 4397 ---
• Step 1: For each concerned set of consecutive changes of value, the on-board shall 

--- Document Chunk 4398 ---
consider the profile as if it would have been received from trackside with, by exception 

--- Document Chunk 4399 ---
to 3.6.3.2.2 c), an incremental distance being negative from the furthest in advance 

--- Document Chunk 4400 ---
concerned change of value to the furthest in rear concerned change of value; 

--- Document Chunk 4401 ---
• Step 2: From the end location to the start location of each “reverted” element(s) 

--- Document Chunk 4402 ---
delimited by a negative incremental distance, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 4403 ---
shall retain the lowest parts of the overlapping elements obtained from step 1; 

--- Document Chunk 4404 ---
• Step 3: The clause 3.6.4.2.3 shall be applied to the profile obtained from step 2, 

--- Document Chunk 4405 ---
resulting in a continuous profile with all discontinuities ordered by increasing individual 

--- Document Chunk 4406 ---
distances referred to the SOLR, as if this profile would have been re ceived by 

--- Document Chunk 4407 ---
trackside being compliant with 3.6. 3.2.2 (i.e. with only unsigned incremental 

--- Document Chunk 4408 ---
distances). 

--- Document Chunk 4409 ---
3.6.4.2.6.1 Note: the recomposed profile obtained from the clause 3.6.4.2.6 may include less 

--- Document Chunk 4410 ---
elements than the profile before relocation, possibly with the original change(s) to higher 

--- Document Chunk 4411 ---
value no longer present depending on the respective speed/gradient values of the

When the on-board performs the transition to level 2, the location items of the MA

stored on-board (referred to balise group 0) are relocated prior to its evaluation: 

--- Document Chunk 4482 ---
• If balise group 1 is still the LRBG/SOLR, the first MA Section end is relocated by 

--- Document Chunk 4483 ---
subtracting D_LINK (1) from MA Section (1) length, to obtain the distance from the 

--- Document Chunk 4484 ---
SOLR to the MA section end (1’) 

--- Document Chunk 4485 ---
• If balise group 2 is already the LRBG/SOLR, the first MA Section end is relocated

by subtracting (D_LINK (1) + D_LINK (2)) from MA Section (1) length, to obtain the 

--- Document Chunk 4487 ---

--- Document Chunk 4488 ---

--- Document Chunk 4523 ---
• 1st relocation: When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board reads UBG1, it does not become the SOLR, 

--- Document Chunk 4524 ---
so that the location items of the TSR within the message it provides are relocated by clause 

--- Document Chunk 4525 ---
3.6.4.2.5c on BG1 (which was received earlier) which is the SOLR at that time: 

--- Document Chunk 4526 ---
➢ the absolute value of the difference between the max safe front end positions against 

--- Document Chunk 4527 ---
BG1 and against UBG1 is added (substraction of a negative difference) to D_TSR 

--- Document Chunk 4528 ---
("max" location item). 

--- Document Chunk 4529 ---
➢ the absolute value of the difference between the min safe front end positions against 

--- Document Chunk 4530 ---
BG1 and against UBG1 is added (substraction of a negative difference) to (D_TSR + 

--- Document Chunk 4531 ---
L_TSR) ("min" location item). 

--- Document Chunk 4532 ---
The start & end locations of the TSR are handled independently ; the original L_TSR is not 

--- Document Chunk 4533 ---
used as a separate variable by the relocation process. 

--- Document Chunk 4534 ---
• 2nd relocation: When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board reads BG2, it becomes the new SOLR, so 

--- Document Chunk 4535 ---
that the TSR location items are relocated on it: despite linking distance is available between 

--- Document Chunk 4536 ---
BG1 and BG2, the relocation of the TSR location items is neither performed by clause 

--- Document Chunk 4537 ---
3.6.4.2.5a nor by clause 3.6.4.2.5b, as the last relocation of the TSR location items has been 

--- Document Chunk 4538 ---
performed by clause 3.6.4.2.5c to a balise group, which was received earlier than the former 

--- Document Chunk 4539 ---
reference balise group of the TSR location items, so: 

--- Document Chunk 4540 ---
➢ the absolute value of the difference between the max safe front end positions against 

--- Document Chunk 4541 ---
BG1 and against BG2 is subtracted from D_TSR ("max" location item). 

--- Document Chunk 4542 ---
➢ the absolute value of the difference between the min safe front end positions against 

--- Document Chunk 4543 ---
BG1 and against BG2 is subtracted from (D_TSR + L_TSR) ("min" location item). 

--- Document Chunk 4544 ---
Each location item has to be handled independently. This example only covers the TSR 

--- Document Chunk 4545 ---
location items. 

--- Document Chunk 4546 ---
• 3rd relocation: When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board reads BG3, it becomes the new SOLR, so 

--- Document Chunk 4547 ---
that the TSR location items are relocated on it: linking distance is available between BG2 and 

--- Document Chunk 4548 ---
BG3 and it is used for the relocation of the TSR location items, as the last relocation of the TSR 

--- Document Chunk 4549 ---
location items has been performed by clause 3.6.4.2.5c but not towards a balise group received 

--- Document Chunk 4550 ---
earlier than the former reference balise group of the TSR location items, so: 

--- Document Chunk 4551 ---
➢ the linking distance between BG2 and BG3, retrieved from linking information and 

--- Document Chunk 4552 ---
augmented by twice the location accuracy of BG2, is subtracted from D_TSR. 

--- Document Chunk 4553 ---
➢ the linking distance between BG2 and BG3, retrieved from linking information and 

--- Document Chunk 4554 ---
diminished by twice the location accuracy of BG2, is subtracted from (D_TSR + L_TSR). 

--- Document Chunk 4555 ---
• 4th relocation: When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board reads BG4, it becomes the new SOLR, so 

--- Document Chunk 4556 ---
that the TSR location items are relocated on it: linking distance is available between BG3 and 

--- Document Chunk 4557 ---
BG4 and it is used as such for the relocation of the TSR location items, as the last relocation of 

--- Document Chunk 4558 ---
the TSR location items has not been performed by clause 3.6.4.2.5c, so: 

--- Document Chunk 4559 ---
➢ the linking distance between BG3 and BG4, retrieved from linking information, is 

--- Document Chunk 4560 ---
subtracted from D_TSR.

does not announce this BGi but BG1 that therefore becomes the new SOLR. 

--- Document Chunk 4612 ---
Then the location items of the MA also released from the transition buffer (referred to

balise group BGc) are relocated to BG1 prior to its evaluation, through this linking

3.6.5.1.8.1 Justification: The mode and level reported in a position report must be consistent with 

--- Document Chunk 4761 ---
the content of the message of the LRBG used in this position report (e.g. if the reported 

--- Document Chunk 4762 ---
train position is within an OS/SH/LS area provided by a Mode Profile given by the LRBG 

--- Document Chunk 4763 ---
used in this position report, the reported mode will be the one requested by the Mode 

--- Document Chunk 4764 ---
Profile). 

--- Document Chunk 4765 ---
3.6.5.2 Report of train integrity information 

--- Document Chunk 4766 ---
3.6.5.2.1 The confirmation of train integrity may be given by external source or by driver. For the 

--- Document Chunk 4767 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, the confirmation of train integrity means that the 

--- Document Chunk 4768 ---
train length stored as valid Train Data or the safe consist length at the time the train was 

--- Document Chunk 4769 ---
last known to be integer can be used for reporting the train position to  the RBC, which 

--- Document Chunk 4770 ---
will allow the trackside to use the information about the confirmed train rear end position. 

--- Document Chunk 4771 ---
3.6.5.2.2 Driver input of train integrity confirmation shall only be permitted at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 4772 ---
3.6.5.2.3 The train integrity information reported to the RBC shall consist of: 

--- Document Chunk 4773 ---
a) Train integrity status information 

--- Document Chunk 4774 ---
• No train integrity information 

--- Document Chunk 4775 ---
• Train integrity confirmed by external source 

--- Document Chunk 4776 ---
• Train integrity confirmed by driver 

--- Document Chunk 4777 ---
• Train integrity lost 

--- Document Chunk 4778 ---
b) Confirmed train length information (only available when train integrity confirmation is 

--- Document Chunk 4779 ---
reported). 

--- Document Chunk 4780 ---
3.6.5.2.4 The confirmed train length information shall represent the distance between the min safe 

--- Document Chunk 4781 ---
rear end at the time the train was last known to be integer and the estimated position of 

--- Document Chunk 4782 ---
the train front  at the time when the train integrity inform ation is sent to the RBC (see 

--- Document Chunk 4783 ---
Figure 15). 

--- Document Chunk 4784 ---
3.6.5.2.4.1 Note: when a confirmation of integrity is received from an external source, this does not 

--- Document Chunk 4785 ---
necessarily mean that the train is complete at the moment that the confirmation is 

--- Document Chunk 4786 ---
received, but rather that the train was k nown to be complete at some time before the 

--- Document Chunk 4787 ---
confirmation of integrity was received. This time will depend on the properties of both the 

--- Document Chunk 4788 ---
external source and the interface to this source.

Table 2c: Transition conditions for the train integrity status information to be reported to 

--- Document Chunk 4950 ---
the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 4951 ---
3.6.5.2.6 Following the successful establishment of a communication session with an RBC, the 

--- Document Chunk 4952 ---
train integrity status information to be repor ted to this RBC shall initially be set to "No 

--- Document Chunk 4953 ---
integrity information" and the conditions of the table 2c shall be evaluated before sending 

--- Document Chunk 4954 ---
the first position report. 

--- Document Chunk 4955 ---
3.6.5.2.7 Note: As long as no train length is available (captured as valid Train Data or derived from 

--- Document Chunk 4956 ---
the safe consist length information when no valid Train Data is available) or as long as 

--- Document Chunk 4957 ---
the train position is not valid  or not referred to an LRBG,  the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 4958 ---
equipment cannot report that the train integrity is confirmed, regardless of the t rain 

--- Document Chunk 4959 ---
integrity information received from an external source. Justification: in order to calculate 

--- Document Chunk 4960 ---
the confirmed train length when reporting a train integrity confirmation, the train position 

--- Document Chunk 4961 ---
must be valid and referred to an LRBG and the train length must be available at the time 

--- Document Chunk 4962 ---
of the train integrity confirmation. 

--- Document Chunk 4963 ---
3.6.5.2.8 Note: In order to keep the sending rate of position reports as requested by the RBC, the 

--- Document Chunk 4964 ---
confirmation of train integrity by an external source does not trigger itself any position 

--- Document Chunk 4965 ---
report. It is only in the first position report following the last confirmation of train integrity 

--- Document Chunk 4966 ---
that such confirmation by external source can be reported. The difference between the 

--- Document Chunk 4967 ---
confirmed train length and the train length will then grow to an extent depending on both 

--- Document Chunk 4968 ---
the frequency of the train integrity confirmation and the position report sending rate. 

--- Document Chunk 4969 ---
3.6.5.2.9 Note: When the information "Train integrity lost" is received, the train integrity status 

--- Document Chunk 4970 ---
information is reported in every position report following the detection of the loss of train 

--- Document Chunk 4971 ---
integrity, until the train integrity is confirmed again, or until the information "Train integrity 

--- Document Chunk 4972 ---
status unknown" is received from the external source, or until the Train Data is 

--- Document Chunk 4973 ---
invalidated.

3.6.6 Geographical position reporting 

--- Document Chunk 4975 ---
3.6.6.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall  display, only on driver request, the 

--- Document Chunk 4976 ---
geographical position of the estimated front end of the train in relation to the track 

--- Document Chunk 4977 ---
kilometre. The display of the geographical position shall also be stopped on driver 

--- Document Chunk 4978 ---
request. 

--- Document Chunk 4979 ---
3.6.6.2 The resolution of the position indication shall be 1 metre (sufficient to allow the driver to 

--- Document Chunk 4980 ---
report the train position when communicating with the signalman).   

--- Document Chunk 4981 ---
3.6.6.3 When receiving new geographical position information (from radio or from balise group), 

--- Document Chunk 4982 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall replace the currently stored geographical 

--- Document Chunk 4983 ---
position information (if any) by this new received one, continuing the ongoing 

--- Document Chunk 4984 ---
geographical position calculation until at least one of the condition of 3.6.6.9 applies.

--- Document Chunk 5015 ---

--- Document Chunk 5105 ---

--- Document Chunk 5106 ---
3.6.7.2 For th e supervision of the distances referred in 3.6.7.1 a), b), c), d) & e) the 

--- Document Chunk 5107 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall take into account, for the concerned 

--- Document Chunk 5108 ---
direction(s), the estimated distance travelled away from the location when their 

--- Document Chunk 5109 ---
supervision was started/re-started. 

--- Document Chunk 5110 ---
3.6.7.3 For the supervision of the distances referred in 3.6.7.1 f) & g) the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 5111 ---
board equipment shall manage a virtual train front position in the following way: 

--- Document Chunk 5112 ---
a) The supervised distance minus the estimated distance travelled away from the 

--- Document Chunk 5113 ---
location when the supervision was started determines the remaining distance from 

--- Document Chunk 5114 ---
the estimated front end position to the end of the supervised distance. 

--- Document Chunk 5115 ---
b) The supervised distance minus the estimated distance travelled away from the 

--- Document Chunk 5116 ---
location when the supervision w as started and minus the odometer under -reading 

--- Document Chunk 5117 ---
amount since the function was activated determines the remaining distance from the 

--- Document Chunk 5118 ---
max(imum) safe front end position to the end of the supervised distance. 

--- Document Chunk 5119 ---
c) The supervised distance minus the estimated distance  travelled away from the 

--- Document Chunk 5120 ---
location when the supervision was started plus the odometer over -reading amount 

--- Document Chunk 5121 ---
since the supervision was started determines the remaining distance from the 

--- Document Chunk 5122 ---
min(imum) safe front end position to the end of the supervised distance. 

--- Document Chunk 5123 ---
3.6.7.3.1 Note 1: The location when the supervision is started/re -started is determined by the 

--- Document Chunk 5124 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board (e.g. from a value of its raw position counter) regardless 

--- Document Chunk 5125 ---
whether there is a stored train position in relation to balise group(s). 

--- Document Chunk 5126 ---
3.6.7.3.2 Note 2: This vir tual train position is created at the time the supervision of the distance 

--- Document Chunk 5127 ---
starts and overpassing a balise group does not impact its related estimated, min safe 

--- Document Chunk 5128 ---
and max safe front end positions. 

--- Document Chunk 5129 ---
3.6.7.4 Any virtual train position in relation to such types of supervision of distance not referred 

--- Document Chunk 5130 ---
to balise group locations shall be deleted when the related supervision ends  (for the 

--- Document Chunk 5131 ---
distance supervised as per 3.6.7.1 f), see 5.8.3.1.3). 

--- Document Chunk 5132 ---
3.6.7.5 For the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff Responsible mode, any update of 

--- Document Chunk 5133 ---
this distance through the RBC, the driver or the triggering of the Override while already 

--- Document Chunk 5134 ---
in SR mode shall be considered as a re-start of the supervision, i.e. any related previous 

--- Document Chunk 5135 ---
virtual train position shall be deleted and replaced by a new one as per 3.6.7. 3. 

--- Document Chunk 5136 ---
Conversely, upon reception of new National Values, the related virtual train position shall 

--- Document Chunk 5137 ---
be re-evaluated as per 3.6.7.3 only considering the new National Value.

3.6.8 Monitoring of odometer accuracy 

--- Document Chunk 5150 ---
3.6.8.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment monitors the odometer accuracy based on the 

--- Document Chunk 5151 ---
separate accumulation of underestimation and overestimation in measuring the 

--- Document Chunk 5152 ---
movement of the train over a fixed distance. 

--- Document Chunk 5153 ---
3.6.8.1.1 Note: The accumulation of the underestimation/overestimation in measuring the 

--- Document Chunk 5154 ---
movements considers that for both the forward and the backwards movements the 

--- Document Chunk 5155 ---
absolute value contributes separately to the accumulation. 

--- Document Chunk 5156 ---
3.6.8.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  shall store the accumulated 

--- Document Chunk 5157 ---
underestimation/overestimation in measuring the movements over a defined total 

--- Document Chunk 5158 ---
distance (as defined in A.3.1). 

--- Document Chunk 5159 ---
3.6.8.3 The check of the odometer accuracy shall be performed periodically at fixed distance 

--- Document Chunk 5160 ---
intervals (see 3.6.8.5 and 3.6.8.7). 

--- Document Chunk 5161 ---
3.6.8.4 The distance of the intervals shall be less than or equal to a defined maximum distance 

--- Document Chunk 5162 ---
interval (as defined in A.3.1). 

--- Document Chunk 5163 ---
3.6.8.5 When performing the check at fixed distance intervals, if any of the accumulated 

--- Document Chunk 5164 ---
underestimation/overestimation in measuring the movements over the defined total 

--- Document Chunk 5165 ---
distance travelled (see 3.6.8.2) exceeds the impairment threshold (as defined in A.3.1), 

--- Document Chunk 5166 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall consider the odometer performance 

--- Document Chunk 5167 ---
impaired, and the driver shall be informed. 

--- Document Chunk 5168 ---
3.6.8.5.1 Note: Exceeding the impairment threshold may indicate t hat the odometer accuracy 

--- Document Chunk 5169 ---
exceeds the performance requirement as defined in SUBSET-041 §5.3.1.1. 

--- Document Chunk 5170 ---
3.6.8.6 Once the odometer performance is impaired, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 5171 ---
shall continue to consider the odometer performance as impaired until the train ha s 

--- Document Chunk 5172 ---
travelled the defined total distance (as defined in A.3.1 see 3.6.8. 2) with both the 

--- Document Chunk 5173 ---
accumulated underestimation and overestimation in measuring the movements being 

--- Document Chunk 5174 ---
continuously below the "accuracy of distances measured on-board". 

--- Document Chunk 5175 ---
3.6.8.6.1 Note: This means that o nce the odometer performance is impaired, the odometer 

--- Document Chunk 5176 ---
performance will continue to be displayed as being impaired until the train has travelled 

--- Document Chunk 5177 ---
at least again the defined total distance (see 3.6.8.2). 

--- Document Chunk 5178 ---
3.6.8.6.2 As long as the odometer performance is considered as i mpaired the on -board shall 

--- Document Chunk 5179 ---
inform the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 5180 ---
3.6.8.7 When performing the check at fixed distance intervals, if any of the accumulated 

--- Document Chunk 5181 ---
underestimation/overestimation in measuring the movements over the defined total 

--- Document Chunk 5182 ---
distance travelled (see 3.6.8. 2) exceeds the saf ety threshold (as defined in A.3.1) , the 

--- Document Chunk 5183 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to mode System Failure.

3.8.1 Characteristics of a MA  

--- Document Chunk 5408 ---
3.8.1.1 The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: 

--- Document Chunk 5409 ---
Structure of an MA): 

--- Document Chunk 5410 ---
a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to move. 

--- Document Chunk 5411 ---
b) When t he Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority is zero, the End of 

--- Document Chunk 5412 ---
Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority); when the target speed is not 

--- Document Chunk 5413 ---
zero, it is called the LOA (Limit of Authority). This non zero target speed can be time 

--- Document Chunk 5414 ---
limited. 

--- Document Chunk 5415 ---
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement 

--- Document Chunk 5416 ---
Authority that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a 

--- Document Chunk 5417 ---
hazardous situation.  

--- Document Chunk 5418 ---
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location beyond 

--- Document Chunk 5419 ---
or at the End of Movement Authority that can be reached by the front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 5420 ---
without a risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance beyond the End of 

--- Document Chunk 5421 ---
Movement Authority is only valid for a defined time. 

--- Document Chunk 5422 ---
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity 

--- Document Chunk 5423 ---
of the End of Movement Authority, when the target speed is zero. One release speed

--- Document Chunk 5434 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 5435 ---
can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release 

--- Document Chunk 5436 ---
speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.3.6.5). 

--- Document Chunk 5437 ---
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section. 

--- Document Chunk 5438 ---
• A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be use d for 

--- Document Chunk 5439 ---
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is 

--- Document Chunk 5440 ---
called the Section time-out.  

--- Document Chunk 5441 ---
• In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5442 ---
This second time -out will be used for the revoca tion of the last section when it is 

--- Document Chunk 5443 ---
occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out. 

--- Document Chunk 5444 ---
3.8.1.2 The values of the time -outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time 

--- Document Chunk 5445 ---
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message. 

--- Document Chunk 5446 ---
3.8.1.3 Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list): 

--- Document Chunk 5447 ---
• the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to fixed 

--- Document Chunk 5448 ---
block principles) 

--- Document Chunk 5449 ---
• the position of the last confirmed rear end of a train i.e. the position deduced from the 

--- Document Chunk 5450 ---
confirmed train length information contained in a position report confirming the train 

--- Document Chunk 5451 ---
integrity (if the line is operated according to moving block principles) 

--- Document Chunk 5452 ---
• the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, confli cting with the current 

--- Document Chunk 5453 ---
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of operation) 

--- Document Chunk 5454 ---
3.8.1.4 Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put 

--- Document Chunk 5455 ---
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous si tuation, also in case the driver 

--- Document Chunk 5456 ---
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can be 

--- Document Chunk 5457 ---
used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 5458 ---
3.8.1.5 Note: Time -out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situat ions 

--- Document Chunk 5459 ---
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on -board will only reflect the 

--- Document Chunk 5460 ---
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive: 

--- Document Chunk 5461 ---
a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests a 

--- Document Chunk 5462 ---
route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train. 

--- Document Chunk 5463 ---
b) End Section time -out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 

--- Document Chunk 5464 ---
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a 

--- Document Chunk 5465 ---
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved. 

--- Document Chunk 5466 ---
c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the overlap 

--- Document Chunk 5467 ---
associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that the train 

--- Document Chunk 5468 ---
has successfully stopped before its End of Movement Authority. If the overlap is still 

--- Document Chunk 5469 ---
unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap. 

--- Document Chunk 5470 ---
3.8.1.6 Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance 

--- Document Chunk 5471 ---
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero, a target speed higher 

--- Document Chunk 5472 ---
than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 5473 ---
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the train from

3.8.2 MA request to the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 5489 ---
3.8.2.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 5490 ---
3.8.2.1.1 The on-board equipment may request a new Movement Authority from the RBC for the 

--- Document Chunk 5491 ---
following reasons: 

--- Document Chunk 5492 ---
a) “Start” selection by the driver (only level 2) 

--- Document Chunk 5493 ---
b) With respect to perturbation location (only level 2) 

--- Document Chunk 5494 ---
c) With respect to MA timer elapsing (only level 2) 

--- Document Chunk 5495 ---
d) Track description deletion (only level 2) 

--- Document Chunk 5496 ---
e) Reception of "track ahead free up to the level 2 transition location" 

--- Document Chunk 5497 ---
3.8.2.1.2 It shall be possible for the RBC to send MA request parameters defining: 

--- Document Chunk 5498 ---
a) whether MA requests shall be repeated and if so, the time between each repetition 

--- Document Chunk 5499 ---
b) the triggering time criterion for the reasons 3.8.2.1.1 b) & c) respectively 

--- Document Chunk 5500 ---
3.8.2.1.3 Note: the MA requests for reasons 3.8.2.1.1 b) & c) can be triggered only if the MA 

--- Document Chunk 5501 ---
request parameters have been received from the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 5502 ---
3.8.2.1.4 The parameters received from the RBC shall be valid until new MA request parameters 

--- Document Chunk 5503 ---
are received from the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 5504 ---
3.8.2.1.4.1 Note: This will lead to immediate sending of an MA request in case at the moment the 

--- Document Chunk 5505 ---
new parameters are received, the time since the last sending of an MA request is equal 

--- Document Chunk 5506 ---
to or higher than the new received repetition period. 

--- Document Chunk 5507 ---
3.8.2.1.5 As long as at least one reason for sending MA requests is applicable and unless it is 

--- Document Chunk 5508 ---
requested by the RBC not to do so, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall repeat 

--- Document Chunk 5509 ---
the MA requests as indicated by the RBC or with a repetition cycle according to a fixed 

--- Document Chunk 5510 ---
value (see appendix A.3.1) in case no MA request parameters are stored on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 5511 ---
3.8.2.1.6 If a reason for sending MA requests becomes applicable while an MA request repetition 

--- Document Chunk 5512 ---
cycle is already ongoing for another reason, the MA request triggered for this new reason 

--- Document Chunk 5513 ---
shall reset the repetition cycle. 

--- Document Chunk 5514 ---
3.8.2.1.7 Together with any MA request the on -board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s) 

--- Document Chunk 5515 ---
that is (are) applicable at the time the MA request is sent.

--- Document Chunk 5534 ---
3.8.2.2.2 With regard to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggered when the trai n

End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -

--- Document Chunk 5680 ---
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater t han its time-out 

--- Document Chunk 5681 ---
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2. 

--- Document Chunk 5682 ---
3.8.4.1.3.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it 

--- Document Chunk 5683 ---
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the time-

--- Document Chunk 5684 ---
out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption is to consider that 

--- Document Chunk 5685 ---
the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section will soon be 

--- Document Chunk 5686 ---
released by the Interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 5687 ---
3.8.4.1.4 In case an End Section timer is already running when the on -board receives a new MA 

--- Document Chunk 5688 ---
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the 

--- Document Chunk 5689 ---
on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time -out value with 

--- Document Chunk 5690 ---
the value received with the new MA.

3.8.4.1.4.1 Justification: this allows repetition o f the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current 

--- Document Chunk 5703 ---
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer. 

--- Document Chunk 5704 ---
3.8.4.2 Section Time-Outs 

--- Document Chunk 5705 ---
3.8.4.2.1 For each section, the on-board shall consider a Section timer that has started: 

--- Document Chunk 5706 ---
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5707 ---
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 5708 ---
group giving the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5709 ---
3.8.4.2.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the same 

--- Document Chunk 5710 ---
time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent 

--- Document Chunk 5711 ---
of in which balise the variable information is given.  

--- Document Chunk 5712 ---
3.8.4.2.2 When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by trackside, 

--- Document Chunk 5713 ---
the following shall apply unless an MA shortening has occurred with A.3.4.1.3 condition 

--- Document Chunk 5714 ---
[11] applied: 

--- Document Chunk 5715 ---
a) the EOA/LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked section. 

--- Document Chunk 5716 ---
Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored 

--- Document Chunk 5717 ---
on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly; 

--- Document Chunk 5718 ---
b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply ; 

--- Document Chunk 5719 ---
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to 

--- Document Chunk 5720 ---
zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn to 

--- Document Chunk 5721 ---
the entry point of the revoked section). 

--- Document Chunk 5722 ---
3.8.4.2.2.1 Justification: Applying 3.8.4.2.2 while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has 

--- Document Chunk 5723 ---
considered the current estimated front end and max safe front end positions, as the EOA 

--- Document Chunk 5724 ---
and SvL respectively, with no Release Speed, c ould lead to inappropriate system 

--- Document Chunk 5725 ---
behaviour such as the EOA being moved in advance of the current one or in the sudden 

--- Document Chunk 5726 ---
supervision of a Release Speed allowing the train to move forward. 

--- Document Chunk 5727 ---
3.8.4.2.3 The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed 

--- Document Chunk 5728 ---
the associated Section timer stop location. 

--- Document Chunk 5729 ---
3.8.4.2.4 In case of reverse movement which brings back the min safe front end of the train in rear 

--- Document Chunk 5730 ---
of a Section timer stop location after the Section timer has been stopped according to 

--- Document Chunk 5731 ---
3.8.4.2.3, the on-board shall consider that the Section timer value became greater than 

--- Document Chunk 5732 ---
its time-out value and shall apply 3.8.4.2.2 once the train has reached standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 5733 ---
3.8.4.2.5 If, upon its evaluation, a new MA includes a section with its timer stop location already in 

--- Document Chunk 5734 ---
rear of the min safe front end of the train, the on -board shall consider that the Section 

--- Document Chunk 5735 ---
timer had been stopped before its value could become greater than its time -out value 

--- Document Chunk 5736 ---
and shall not apply 3.8.4.2.2. 

--- Document Chunk 5737 ---
3.8.4.2.5.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the  timer stop location, therefore it 

--- Document Chunk 5738 ---
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the time-

--- Document Chunk 5739 ---
out value has elapsed before the crossing event. Knowing the above on -board

--- Document Chunk 5752 ---
ensure a safe release of the corresponding section. 

--- Document Chunk 5753 ---
3.8.4.3 Time-out of the speed associated with the End of Movement Authority (LOA speed 

--- Document Chunk 5754 ---
time out) 

--- Document Chunk 5755 ---
3.8.4.3.1 For the LOA speed, the on-board shall consider a timer that has started: 

--- Document Chunk 5756 ---
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5757 ---
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 5758 ---
group giving the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5759 ---
3.8.4.3.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the same 

--- Document Chunk 5760 ---
time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is independent 

--- Document Chunk 5761 ---
of in which balise the variable information is given. 

--- Document Chunk 5762 ---
3.8.4.3.2 When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 5763 ---
trackside, the speed associated with the LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of 

--- Document Chunk 5764 ---
Authority becomes an End of Authority  and the SvL is defined on -board according to 

--- Document Chunk 5765 ---
3.8.4.5). Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 

--- Document Chunk 5766 ---
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 5767 ---
3.8.4.4 Time-out of Overlap 

--- Document Chunk 5768 ---
3.8.4.4.1 The Overlap timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the Overlap timer 

--- Document Chunk 5769 ---
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end. The timer shall be considered 

--- Document Chunk 5770 ---
as started even if a time-out value “infinite” is given. 

--- Document Chunk 5771 ---
3.8.4.4.2 When the Overlap timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 5772 ---
trackside, the following shall apply: 

--- Document Chunk 5773 ---
a) the overlap information shall be deleted and the Supervised Location shall be  

--- Document Chunk 5774 ---
determined in accordance with 3.8.4.5. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list 

--- Document Chunk 5775 ---
of location based information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 5776 ---
b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted 

--- Document Chunk 5777 ---
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set to 

--- Document Chunk 5778 ---
zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA). 

--- Document Chunk 5779 ---
3.8.4.4.3 If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 5780 ---
shall consider that the Overlap timer value beca me greater than its time -out value and 

--- Document Chunk 5781 ---
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2. 

--- Document Chunk 5782 ---
3.8.4.4.4 In case no Overlap timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 

--- Document Chunk 5783 ---
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 5784 ---
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time -out value and 

--- Document Chunk 5785 ---
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2. 

--- Document Chunk 5786 ---
3.8.4.4.4.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it

--- Document Chunk 5800 ---
the time -out value has been exceeded and therefore that the Overlap will soon be 

--- Document Chunk 5801 ---
released by the Interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 5802 ---
3.8.4.4.5 In case an Overlap timer is already running when the on-board receives a new MA with 

--- Document Chunk 5803 ---
an Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 5804 ---
shall keep the Overlap timer running but replace the Overlap time-out value with the 

--- Document Chunk 5805 ---
value received with the new MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5806 ---
3.8.4.4.5.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current 

--- Document Chunk 5807 ---
MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer. 

--- Document Chunk 5808 ---
3.8.4.5 Supervised Location 

--- Document Chunk 5809 ---
3.8.4.5.1 Unless stated otherwise, the Supervised Location (SvL) shall be defined on-board as: 

--- Document Chunk 5810 ---
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out). 

--- Document Chunk 5811 ---
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any). 

--- Document Chunk 5812 ---
c) if not, the end of the End Section. 

--- Document Chunk 5813 ---
3.8.4.5.2 As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 5814 ---
3.8.4.6 Infill MA (level 1 only) 

--- Document Chunk 5815 ---
3.8.4.6.1 An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5816 ---
3.8.4.6.2 An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the on-board equipment is in FS, AD or 

--- Document Chunk 5817 ---
LS mode. 

--- Document Chunk 5818 ---
3.8.4.6.3 The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main signal 

--- Document Chunk 5819 ---
i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is transmitted in advance 

--- Document Chunk 5820 ---
by the infill device. 

--- Document Chunk 5821 ---
3.8.4.6.4 An infill MA shall be evaluated on-board only if the linking information, regarding the main 

--- Document Chunk 5822 ---
signal balise group to which it refers, is available. 

--- Document Chunk 5823 ---
3.8.4.6.5 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal: 

--- Document Chunk 5824 ---
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the 

--- Document Chunk 5825 ---
first encountered balise of the infill balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 5826 ---
b) When the infill information is received from a lo op at the time of receiving the loop 

--- Document Chunk 5827 ---
message. 

--- Document Chunk 5828 ---
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time 

--- Document Chunk 5829 ---
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5830 ---
3.8.5 MA Update

--- Document Chunk 5843 ---
a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. no n-infill 

--- Document Chunk 5844 ---
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced 

--- Document Chunk 5845 ---
by the new data.  

--- Document Chunk 5846 ---
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced balise 

--- Document Chunk 5847 ---
group at the next main signal shall be replaced. 

--- Document Chunk 5848 ---
3.8.5.1.1 Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1 and the 

--- Document Chunk 5849 ---
Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6). 

--- Document Chunk 5850 ---
3.8.5.1.2 When an infill MA is received, the on -board shall start a new MA sectio n at the infill 

--- Document Chunk 5851 ---
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1). 

--- Document Chunk 5852 ---
3.8.5.1.3 If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former 

--- Document Chunk 5853 ---
MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to 

--- Document Chunk 5854 ---
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 

--- Document Chunk 5855 ---
which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 5856 ---
3.8.5.1.4 If a new MA defines an SvL while the on-board was supervising an LOA, this shall always 

--- Document Chunk 5857 ---
be considered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of the SvL 

--- Document Chunk 5858 ---
location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 

--- Document Chunk 5859 ---
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 5860 ---
3.8.5.1.5 On reception of a shortened MA sent together with other location based information, the 

--- Document Chunk 5861 ---
deletion of information referred to in the clauses 3.8.5.1.3 and 3.8.5.1.4 shall apply to the 

--- Document Chunk 5862 ---
information stored on -board prior to the reception of this trackside information, before 

--- Document Chunk 5863 ---
any clause dealing with the replacement o f information (e.g. 3.7.3.1 or 3.18.2.9 first 

--- Document Chunk 5864 ---
bullet) is applied. 

--- Document Chunk 5865 ---
3.8.5.2 It shall be possible to update the length of an MA section by means of repositioning 

--- Document Chunk 5866 ---
information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3). 

--- Document Chunk 5867 ---
3.8.5.2.1 Note: The concerned MA section need not be the end section. 

--- Document Chunk 5868 ---
3.8.5.2.2 Upon reception of repositioning information and only if linking information has announced 

--- Document Chunk 5869 ---
a following balise group as unk nown but containing repositioning information , the on -

--- Document Chunk 5870 ---
board shall update the length of the current MA section in which the train front end is. 

--- Document Chunk 5871 ---
3.8.5.2.3 A balise group message containing a non-infill movement authority shall not contain 

--- Document Chunk 5872 ---
repositioning information for the same direction. 

--- Document Chunk 5873 ---
3.8.5.2.3.1 Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA. 

--- Document Chunk 5874 ---
3.8.5.2.4 The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be 

--- Document Chunk 5875 ---
considered as an MA shortening by the on-board equipment.

--- Document Chunk 6133 ---
3.8.6.1 It shall be possible to shorten a g iven MA using a special procedure between on -board 

--- Document Chunk 6134 ---
equipment and RBC. The procedure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 6135 ---
a) The RBC sends a request to shorten MA, which includes a proposed shortened MA 

--- Document Chunk 6136 ---
with an E OA closer to the train than the current EOA/LOA, optionally with a mod e 

--- Document Chunk 6137 ---
profile and in case of SH mode profile optionally with a list of balise  groups for SH 

--- Document Chunk 6138 ---
area.

--- Document Chunk 6150 ---
b) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check the train front end position versus 

--- Document Chunk 6151 ---
the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA. 

--- Document Chunk 6152 ---
• If it is in rear , the request shall be accepted and the on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 6153 ---
consider the proposed shortened MA as  the new MA, together with its 

--- Document Chunk 6154 ---
accompanying mode profile (if any) and list of balise groups for SH area (if any). 

--- Document Chunk 6155 ---
• If it is in advance , the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA , 

--- Document Chunk 6156 ---
mode profile (if any) and list of balise groups for SH area (if any) shall remain valid 

--- Document Chunk 6157 ---
c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision. 

--- Document Chunk 6158 ---
3.8.6.2 If the request from the RBC is granted by the on -board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the 

--- Document Chunk 6159 ---
exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 6160 ---
3.9 Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only) 

--- Document Chunk 6161 ---
3.9.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 6162 ---
3.9.1.1 It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on-board equipment using 

--- Document Chunk 6163 ---
a) Balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 6164 ---
b) Euroloops 

--- Document Chunk 6165 ---
c) Radio infill units. 

--- Document Chunk 6166 ---
3.9.1.1.1 If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes infill 

--- Document Chunk 6167 ---
information, those devices are also identified as infill devices. 

--- Document Chunk 6168 ---
3.9.1.2 The principle used for the infill information is the same independent of t ransmission 

--- Document Chunk 6169 ---
media. 

--- Document Chunk 6170 ---
3.9.1.3 If the on-board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested by 

--- Document Chunk 6171 ---
the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by the 

--- Document Chunk 6172 ---
on-board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the  previously received 

--- Document Chunk 6173 ---
information.  

--- Document Chunk 6174 ---
3.9.1.4 Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already 

--- Document Chunk 6175 ---
covered in previous chapters).

--- Document Chunk 6204 ---
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  

--- Document Chunk 6205 ---
3.9.3.2 The orders shall be sent via balise groups or via Radio Infill units. 

--- Document Chunk 6206 ---
3.9.3.3 The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored: 

--- Document Chunk 6207 ---
a) Intentionally deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 6208 ---
b) If the GSM-R radio system is not installed on-board.

--- Document Chunk 6211 ---
3.9.3.5 If the order to establish a communication ses sion with a radio infill unit sent via balise 

--- Document Chunk 6212 ---
groups is received, the on-board equipment shall, once the location indicated in the order 

--- Document Chunk 6213 ---
is reached: 

--- Document Chunk 6214 ---
a) terminate any existing communication session(s) with RIU(s) not indicated in the order 

--- Document Chunk 6215 ---
b) as soon as a new communication session can be handled, establish a communication

3.9.3.7 A Radio Infill Unit shall not initiate a communication session with an on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 6241 ---
3.9.3.8 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall 

--- Document Chunk 6242 ---
be sent together with the following radio infill area information: 

--- Document Chunk 6243 ---
a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the 

--- Document Chunk 6244 ---
order).Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location marks 

--- Document Chunk 6245 ---
the beginning of the Radio Infill Area. 

--- Document Chunk 6246 ---
b) Next main signal balise group identifier ( ignored by the on -board if the action is 

--- Document Chunk 6247 ---
Terminate communication session).Note: the reference location of this balise group 

--- Document Chunk 6248 ---
marks the end of the Radio Infill Area. 

--- Document Chunk 6249 ---
3.9.3.8.1 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units (see 

--- Document Chunk 6250 ---
3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information. 

--- Document Chunk 6251 ---
3.9.3.9 The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the 

--- Document Chunk 6252 ---
operational level of the on -board i.e. the information in the balise group shall be taken 

--- Document Chunk 6253 ---
into account as usual in level 1.  

--- Document Chunk 6254 ---
3.9.3.10 The on-board equipment shall inform the radio infill unit 

--- Document Chunk 6255 ---
a) As soon as the location indicated in the order sent via balise groups is passed (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 6256 ---
entry of the train in the infill area) 

--- Document Chunk 6257 ---
b) As soon as the next main signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise 

--- Document Chunk 6258 ---
groups is read or the on-board equipment detects that it was missed.  

--- Document Chunk 6259 ---
3.9.3.11 The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on-board equipment shall include 

--- Document Chunk 6260 ---
a) Train identity (ETCS-ID of the on-board equipment) 

--- Document Chunk 6261 ---
b) Position report 

--- Document Chunk 6262 ---
c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group 

--- Document Chunk 6263 ---
d) Time stamp 

--- Document Chunk 6264 ---
3.9.3.11.1 Justification:  

--- Document Chunk 6265 ---
a) The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages 

--- Document Chunk 6266 ---
b) The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infill unit to identify 

--- Document Chunk 6267 ---
safely where the train is going, even in the case of a points area 

--- Document Chunk 6268 ---

--- Document Chunk 6356 ---
3.10.1.3 The same identifier shall be used in case the emergency message is repeated. 

--- Document Chunk 6357 ---
3.10.1.3.1 If the on -board receives a new message with the same identifier it shall replace the 

--- Document Chunk 6358 ---
previous one. 

--- Document Chunk 6359 ---
3.10.1.4 Each emergency message to an on-board equipment shall be acknowledged, using the 

--- Document Chunk 6360 ---
corresponding emergency message identification number. 

--- Document Chunk 6361 ---
3.10.1.4.1 This acknowledgement informs the RBC about the use of the emergency message by 

--- Document Chunk 6362 ---
on-board equipment and is independent from the general acknowledgement for track-to-

--- Document Chunk 6363 ---

3.10.2 Emergency Stop  

--- Document Chunk 6365 ---
3.10.2.1 It shall be possible to stop a train with a conditional or an unconditional emergency stop 

--- Document Chunk 6366 ---
message.  

--- Document Chunk 6367 ---
3.10.2.2 A con ditional emergency stop message shall contain the information of a new stop 

--- Document Chunk 6368 ---
location, referred to the LRBG. In case, when receiving this message 

--- Document Chunk 6369 ---
a) the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the 

--- Document Chunk 6370 ---
emergency stop message shall be rejected. 

--- Document Chunk 6371 ---
b) the train has not yet passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the 

--- Document Chunk 6372 ---
emergency stop message shall be accepted: 

--- Document Chunk 6373 ---
• If this new stop location is not beyond the current EOA/LOA, the on -board shall 

--- Document Chunk 6374 ---
use it to define a new EOA/SvL with no release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 6375 ---
• If this new stop location is beyond the current EOA and not beyond the current 

--- Document Chunk 6376 ---
SvL, the on-board shall use it to define a new SvL with no release speed, keeping 

--- Document Chunk 6377 ---
the current EOA unchanged. 

--- Document Chunk 6378 ---
• If this new stop location is beyond the current S vL, the on -board shall keep the 

--- Document Chunk 6379 ---
current EOA/SvL and release speed unchanged. 

--- Document Chunk 6380 ---
• If this new stop location is beyond the current LOA, the on-board shall replace the

--- Document Chunk 6409 ---
3.11.1 Introduction  

--- Document Chunk 6410 ---
3.11.1.1 The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different 

--- Document Chunk 6411 ---
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions. 

--- Document Chunk 6412 ---
3.11.1.2 A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS level. 

--- Document Chunk 6413 ---
3.11.2 Definition of Static Speed Restriction 

--- Document Chunk 6414 ---
3.11.2.1 Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the t rackside infrastructure, the train 

--- Document Chunk 6415 ---
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 6416 ---
3.11.2.2 There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:   

--- Document Chunk 6417 ---
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP) 

--- Document Chunk 6418 ---
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP) 

--- Document Chunk 6419 ---
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR) 

--- Document Chunk 6420 ---
d) Maximum Train Speed 

--- Document Chunk 6421 ---
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1) 

--- Document Chunk 6422 ---
f) Mode related Speed Restriction.

3.11.3.1.2 The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent. 

--- Document Chunk 6472 ---
The relationship between track and train characteristics determines the individual Static 

--- Document Chunk 6473 ---
Speed Profile for each train.  

--- Document Chunk 6474 ---
3.11.3.1.3 It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static 

--- Document Chunk 6475 ---
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit specified 

--- Document Chunk 6476 ---
for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element. 

--- Document Chunk 6477 ---
3.11.3.2 Static Speed Profile Categories 

--- Document Chunk 6478 ---
3.11.3.2.1 It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP 

--- Document Chunk 6479 ---
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 6480 ---
3.11.3.2.1.1 The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types: 

--- Document Chunk 6481 ---
a) The “Cant Deficiency” SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to o ne 

--- Document Chunk 6482 ---
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at which 

--- Document Chunk 6483 ---
a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific speed 

--- Document Chunk 6484 ---
limit in a curve with regards to this category. 

--- Document Chunk 6485 ---
b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories 

--- Document Chunk 6486 ---
corresponding to the other international train categories 

--- Document Chunk 6487 ---
3.11.3.2.1.2 Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the following 

--- Document Chunk 6488 ---
requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both  types of specific SSP 

--- Document Chunk 6489 ---
categories. 

--- Document Chunk 6490 ---
3.11.3.2.2 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall: 

--- Document Chunk 6491 ---
a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default “Cant Deficiency” 

--- Document Chunk 6492 ---
SSP 

--- Document Chunk 6493 ---
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs 

--- Document Chunk 6494 ---
c) specify, for each “other specific” SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Cant Deficiency” 

--- Document Chunk 6495 ---
SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment according to 3.11.3.2.3 

--- Document Chunk 6496 ---
3.11.3.2.3 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 6497 ---

a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matching its “Cant Deficiency” train category, 

--- Document Chunk 6500 ---
OR 

--- Document Chunk 6501 ---
b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP with the highest Ca nt Deficiency value below

3.11.4 Axle load Speed Profile 

--- Document Chunk 6533 ---

3.11.4.3.1 Note: As a consequence, it is the trackside responsibility to provide the axle load

--- Document Chunk 6614 ---
3.11.6.2 This speed value shall be taken into account by the on-board equipment as soon as it is 

--- Document Chunk 6615 ---
received on-board, with the exception of a signalling related speed restriction from an 

--- Document Chunk 6616 ---
infill device. In case of infill information the speed restriction shall be taken into account 

--- Document Chunk 6617 ---
from the location reference of the balise group at the next main signal. 

--- Document Chunk 6618 ---
3.11.6.3 The speed restriction shall be valid until a new signalling related speed restriction is 

--- Document Chunk 6619 ---
received. 

--- Document Chunk 6620 ---
3.11.6.3.1 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches from level 1 to level 2, the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 6621 ---
related speed restriction shall remain valid until a level 2 MA is accepted by the 

--- Document Chunk 6622 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 6623 ---
3.11.6.4 In case of a signal at danger the signalling related speed restriction shall have value  

--- Document Chunk 6624 ---
zero, which shall be evaluated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment not as a speed 

--- Document Chunk 6625 ---
limit but as a train trip order. 

--- Document Chunk 6626 ---
3.11.6.5 In case of infill information the signalling related speed restriction at zero shall be ignored. 

--- Document Chunk 6627 ---
3.11.6.5.1 Note: The infill information will also include an EOA at the next main signal that will be

3.11.7 Mode related speed restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 6630 ---

a) The loading gauge profile of the train is not included in the list of loading gauges 

--- Document Chunk 6956 ---
accepted by trackside 

--- Document Chunk 6957 ---
b) The list of traction systems accepted by the engine does not include the one received 

--- Document Chunk 6958 ---
from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 6959 ---
c) The axle load category of the train is not included in the list of permitted ones received 

--- Document Chunk 6960 ---
from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 6961 ---
3.12.2.3.1 Exception to 3.12.2.3 b): If the engine is able to run on a line not fitted with any traction 

--- Document Chunk 6962 ---
system, unsuitability never exists. 

--- Document Chunk 6963 ---
3.12.2.4 If at least one unsuitability exists, the closest location corresponding to the

3.13.1.1.1 Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on-board can only assure this when the 

--- Document Chunk 7205 ---
following necessary conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 7206 ---
• Brake system of the train functions as specified 

--- Document Chunk 7207 ---
• wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 7208 ---
• Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs) are correctly entered into the 

--- Document Chunk 7209 ---
on-board 

--- Document Chunk 7210 ---
3.13.1.2 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes 

--- Document Chunk 7211 ---
them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released. 

--- Document Chunk 7212 ---
However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment 

--- Document Chunk 7213 ---
fail. Also the way the brakes are r eleased by the driver after a revocation of a brake 

--- Document Chunk 7214 ---
command is an implementation issue.

3.13.2 Inputs for speed and distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 7371 ---
3.13.2.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 7372 ---
3.13.2.1.1 The traction / braking models, the brake position / brake percentage are used for the 

--- Document Chunk 7373 ---
definition of the kinematic behaviour of the train after a service brake command or an 

--- Document Chunk 7374 ---
emergency brake command has been initiated. 

--- Document Chunk 7375 ---
3.13.2.1.2 However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within 

--- Document Chunk 7376 ---
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore incorporated 

--- Document Chunk 7377 ---
for the speed and distance monitoring. 

--- Document Chunk 7378 ---
3.13.2.1.3 The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking 

--- Document Chunk 7379 ---
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are 

--- Document Chunk 7380 ---
required for reference conditions set by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 7381 ---
3.13.2.2 Train related inputs 

--- Document Chunk 7382 ---
3.13.2.2.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 7383 ---
3.13.2.2.1.1 The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are: 

--- Document Chunk 7384 ---
a) Traction model 

--- Document Chunk 7385 ---
b) Braking models (brake reaction time, brake build up time and speed dependent 

--- Document Chunk 7386 ---
deceleration) or brake percentage 

--- Document Chunk 7387 ---
c) Brake position 

--- Document Chunk 7388 ---
d) Special brakes (interface configuration and status) 

--- Document Chunk 7389 ---
e) Service brake (interface configuration and application) 

--- Document Chunk 7390 ---
f) Traction cut-off interface 

--- Document Chunk 7391 ---
g) On-board correction factors 

--- Document Chunk 7392 ---
h) Nominal rotating mass 

--- Document Chunk 7393 ---
i) Train length 

--- Document Chunk 7394 ---
j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 7395 ---
k)  Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed)

3.13.2.2.1.2 These train related inputs are acquired as Train Data (see 3.18.3.2 items b) c) and 

--- Document Chunk 7408 ---
d)), except: 

--- Document Chunk 7409 ---
• the configuration of the special brakes, service brake and traction cut -off interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 7410 ---
which are not affected by the Train Data acquisition, 

--- Document Chunk 7411 ---
• the service brake application and the special brakes statuses which are continuously 

--- Document Chunk 7412 ---
acquired on the Train Interface, 

--- Document Chunk 7413 ---
• the fixed values. 

--- Document Chunk 7414 ---
3.13.2.2.1.3 The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train Data, 

--- Document Chunk 7415 ---
unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model is 

--- Document Chunk 7416 ---
applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits).

3.13.2.2.2 Traction model 

--- Document Chunk 7418 ---
3.13.2.2.2.1 The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. 

--- Document Chunk 7419 ---
Depending on whether the traction cut -off command is implemented or not (see 

--- Document Chunk 7420 ---
3.13.2.2.8.1), i t shall describe the nominal traction cut -off time (T_traction_cut_off) 

--- Document Chunk 7421 ---
counted from the moment when either the traction cut-off command or the emergency 

--- Document Chunk 7422 ---
brake command is respectively triggered by the on -board (t0) to the moment the 

--- Document Chunk 7423 ---
acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is zero (t1). The estimated acceleration value of

the train shall be considered during this time.

3.13.2.2.3.1.5 The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full

3.13.2.2.3.1.6 The model shall be used for the emergency brake nominal deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 7472 ---
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 

--- Document Chunk 7473 ---
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)).

3.13.2.2.3.1.7 It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of

A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V)  for each combination of use of 

--- Document Chunk 7476 ---
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake. 

--- Document Chunk 7477 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.8 Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence of 

--- Document Chunk 7478 ---
a specific brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the choice

to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for A_brake_emergency(V)

b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the

3.13.2.2.3.2.4 The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as

3.13.2.2.3.2.6 Note: The equivalent brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning of

the build-up time the ramp and step models assume a deceleration smaller than the real

shape, in the later part this is compensated by a higher deceleration. The approximation

done with the 95% factor is compensated by the margin between the models and the

3.13.2.2.3.2.9 Note: Individual values of T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service may be equal,

account or not the contribution of a specific brake for T_brake_emergency and 

--- Document Chunk 7558 ---
T_brake_service is only rolling stock dependent, not an ETCS implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 7559 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.10 Note: In general, T_brake_emergency and T_brake_service are determined by the 

--- Document Chunk 7560 ---
pneumatic brake therefore avoiding to take into account of the influence of the 

--- Document Chunk 7561 ---
regenerative brake, eddy current brake or magnetic shoe brake. However, if the Electro-

3.13.3 Conversion Models 

--- Document Chunk 7935 ---
3.13.3.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 7936 ---
3.13.3.1.1 For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brak e characteristics can 

--- Document Chunk 7937 ---
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre -

--- Document Chunk 7938 ---
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only 

--- Document Chunk 7939 ---
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current tra in composition is to include 

--- Document Chunk 7940 ---
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from the 

--- Document Chunk 7941 ---
driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models are 

--- Document Chunk 7942 ---
therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake percentage and 

--- Document Chunk 7943 ---
brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model. 

--- Document Chunk 7944 ---
3.13.3.1.2 Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake 

--- Document Chunk 7945 ---
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications. 

--- Document Chunk 7946 ---
3.13.3.2 Applicability of the conversion models 

--- Document Chunk 7947 ---
3.13.3.2.1 The conversion models shall be used by the on-board equipment if the brake percentage 

--- Document Chunk 7948 ---
is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the brake percentage 

--- Document Chunk 7949 ---
and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the conversion models: 

--- Document Chunk 7950 ---
a) 0 ≤ V ≤ 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h 

--- Document Chunk 7951 ---
b) 30 ≤ λ ≤ 250, where λ is the brake percentage in % 

--- Document Chunk 7952 ---
c) 0 ≤ L ≤ Lmax, where L is the train length in m  and where Lmax = 900 m if the brake 

--- Document Chunk 7953 ---
position is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500  m if the brake position is “Freight 

--- Document Chunk 7954 ---
train in P” or “Freight train in G” 

--- Document Chunk 7955 ---
3.13.3.2.1.1 Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the 

--- Document Chunk 7956 ---
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model. 

--- Document Chunk 7957 ---
3.13.3.2.2 For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire 

--- Document Chunk 7958 ---
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable, which 

--- Document Chunk 7959 ---
means that braking models (i.e. pre-programmed deceleration profiles and brake build 

--- Document Chunk 7960 ---
up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function. 

--- Document Chunk 7961 ---
3.13.3.3 Brake percentage conversion model 

--- Document Chunk 7962 ---
3.13.3.3.1 Input parameters 

--- Document Chunk 7963 ---
3.13.3.3.1.1 The input for the model shall be the brake percentage of the train as defined in 

--- Document Chunk 7964 ---
3.13.2.2.5. 

--- Document Chunk 7965 ---
3.13.3.3.2 Calculation of the basic deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 7966 ---
3.13.3.3.2.1 The basic deceleration A_basic(V) shall be given as a step function of the speed using 

--- Document Chunk 7967 ---
the algorithm defined in Appendix A.3.7.

--- Document Chunk 8096 ---
3.13.4.3.1 The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see 

--- Document Chunk 8097 ---
Figure 35). 

--- Document Chunk 8098 ---
3.13.4.3.1.1 Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of the 

--- Document Chunk 8099 ---
gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating mass, 

--- Document Chunk 8100 ---
not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy added to the 

--- Document Chunk 8101 ---
train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. This can be 

--- Document Chunk 8102 ---
observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train with part 

--- Document Chunk 8103 ---
of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2, the same 

--- Document Chunk 8104 ---
amount of energy is added t o the train. But now a part of that energy is converted into 

--- Document Chunk 8105 ---
rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear forward motion. The 

--- Document Chunk 8106 ---
latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for the train without rotating 

--- Document Chunk 8107 ---
mass. 

--- Document Chunk 8108 ---
3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it is 

--- Document Chunk 8109 ---
already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 8110 ---
3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used: 

--- Document Chunk 8111 ---
a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown: 

--- Document Chunk 8112 ---
• Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max) 

--- Document Chunk 8113 ---
• Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)

--- Document Chunk 8115 ---
• Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom) 

--- Document Chunk 8116 ---
• Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)

A_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient (downhill acceleration is given

3.13.7 Determination of Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP) 

--- Document Chunk 8490 ---
3.13.7.1 The Most Restrictive Speed Profile (MRSP) is a description of the most restrictive speed 

--- Document Chunk 8491 ---
restrictions the train must obey on a given piece of track. 

--- Document Chunk 8492 ---
3.13.7.2 The Most Restrictive Speed Profile shall be derived from elements corresponding to all 

--- Document Chunk 8493 ---
speed restrictions (see 3.13.2.2.13 & 3.13.2.3.2), some elements being compensated by 

--- Document Chunk 8494 ---
the train length if requested by trackside (see 3.11.3.1.3 for SSP, 3.11.4.6 for ASP and 

--- Document Chunk 8495 ---
3.11.5.3 for TSR). To do so, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall continuously compute the 

--- Document Chunk 8496 ---
MRSP current speed (V_MRSP), which is the lowest speed of the MRSP elements 

--- Document Chunk 8497 ---
encountered between the min safe front end and the max safe front end of the train.

--- Document Chunk 8508 ---
3.13.7.2.2 Note 2: The MRSP as a whole cannot be computed in advance by the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 8509 ---
equipment, since the locations of its speed increases/decreases depend on the size of 

--- Document Chunk 8510 ---
the train position confidence interval at a given time/location.

3.13.8 Determination of targets and brake deceleration curves 

--- Document Chunk 8512 ---
3.13.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 8513 ---
3.13.8.1.1 A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train m ust 

--- Document Chunk 8514 ---
decelerate before reaching the target location. 

--- Document Chunk 8515 ---
3.13.8.1.2 For that purpose, the on-board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related to 

--- Document Chunk 8516 ---
the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections 3.13.6.2.1, 

--- Document Chunk 8517 ---
3.13.6.3.1and 3.13.6.3.2.5.

3.13.8.1.3 These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 8530 ---
curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of 

--- Document Chunk 8531 ---
parabola, each one being based on one of the speed/distance dependent deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 8532 ---
values (see Figure 38). 

--- Document Chunk 8533 ---
3.13.8.2 Determination of the supervised targets 

--- Document Chunk 8534 ---
3.13.8.2.1 The on-board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the 

--- Document Chunk 8535 ---
following types of target: 

--- Document Chunk 8536 ---
a) the start locations of the MRSP elements whose speed is lower than V_MRSP and  

--- Document Chunk 8537 ---
which are in advance of the max safe front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 8538 ---
b) the Limit of Authority (LOA) 

--- Document Chunk 8539 ---
c) the End of Authority (EOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL) 

--- Document Chunk 8540 ---
d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff 

--- Document Chunk 8541 ---
Responsible, with a target speed zero 

--- Document Chunk 8542 ---
3.13.8.2.1.1 Note: depending on the information received from trackside and the position of the 

--- Document Chunk 8543 ---
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty. 

--- Document Chunk 8544 ---
3.13.8.2.2 The list of supervised targets shall be re-evaluated when any of the elements it is built of 

--- Document Chunk 8545 ---
is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on -board, update of stored 

--- Document Chunk 8546 ---
information in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)). 

--- Document Chunk 8547 ---
3.13.8.2.3 A target corresponding to an MRSP element shall be removed from the list of supervised 

--- Document Chunk 8548 ---
targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the target location. 

--- Document Chunk 8549 ---
3.13.8.3 Emergency Brake Deceleration curves (EBD) 

--- Document Chunk 8550 ---
3.13.8.3.1 If a target belongs to the MRSP or is an LOA, the on-board shall calculate an EBD curve 

--- Document Chunk 8551 ---
based on the safe deceleration A_safe(V,d), that crosses the ceiling speed EBI 

--- Document Chunk 8552 ---
supervision limit (see 3.13.9.2) at the target location, and that extends up to the location 

--- Document Chunk 8553 ---
where the target speed is reached (EBD foot).

--- Document Chunk 8632 ---
A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where the GUI speed 

--- Document Chunk 8633 ---
is equal to the target speed) shall be: 

--- Document Chunk 8634 ---
a) the target location, in case of EOA/SvL

3.13.9 Supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 8637 ---
3.13.9.1 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 8638 ---
3.13.9.1.1 In this chapter the following supervision limits are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 8639 ---
• Emergency brake intervention (EBI) 

--- Document Chunk 8640 ---
• Service brake intervention (SBI) 

--- Document Chunk 8641 ---
• Warning (W) 

--- Document Chunk 8642 ---
• Permitted speed (P) 

--- Document Chunk 8643 ---
• Indication (I) 

--- Document Chunk 8644 ---
• Release speed monitoring start location 

--- Document Chunk 8645 ---
3.13.9.1.2 The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the 

--- Document Chunk 8646 ---
train will remain within the various limits (in distance/speed) imposed by the trackside.

3.13.9.2 Ceiling supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 8662 ---
3.13.9.2.1 The ceiling supervision limits are derived from the MRSP elements, where the speed is 

--- Document Chunk 8663 ---
constant (refer to 3.13.7) or from the LOA. 

--- Document Chunk 8664 ---
3.13.9.2.2 From an MRSP element or from the LOA, the Permitted speed, Warning, Service brake

--- Document Chunk 8776 ---

a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction 

--- Document Chunk 8781 ---
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem 

--- Document Chunk 8782 ---
3.13.9.3.2.3 The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 8783 ---
a) when the traction cut-off is implemented: 

--- Document Chunk 8784 ---
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0). 

--- Document Chunk 8785 ---
b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off 

--- Document Chunk 8786 ---
3.13.9.3.2.4 Note: When the traction cut -off is implemented, the traction cut -off command is 

--- Document Chunk 8787 ---
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the equation 

--- Document Chunk 8788 ---
above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from the EBD. 

--- Document Chunk 8789 ---
3.13.9.3.2.5 T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.4.

the p erturbation location, which must be full y predictable for trackside engineering

The third and fourth assumptions are intended to consider the nominal operation, in 

--- Document Chunk 9103 ---
which the train speed follows the permitted speed, leading to the reduction of the needed 

--- Document Chunk 9104 ---
brake build up times to the minimum before the target location is reached. 

--- Document Chunk 9105 ---
The fifth assumption is to ensure that the permitted speed displayed to the driver, 

--- Document Chunk 9106 ---
considering the brake build up times reduction, is not higher than the target speed at the 

--- Document Chunk 9107 ---
target location. 

--- Document Chunk 9108 ---
3.13.9.3.5.11 In case a non protecte d LX start location is supervised as both temporary EOA and

--- Document Chunk 9110 ---

--- Document Chunk 9111 ---
determine the location where the supervision of the LX start location is substituted by the 

--- Document Chunk 9112 ---
supervision of the LX speed (see section 5.16.3). 

--- Document Chunk 9113 ---
3.13.9.3.5.12 To calculate this location , th e same formulas defined above with V_est shall be

3.13.9.3.6.2 If the service brake feedback interface is not available for use, then T_indication shall 

--- Document Chunk 9152 ---
be calculated as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 9153 ---
𝑇𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝑚𝑎𝑥{(0.8⋅𝑇𝑏𝑠_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑),5𝑠}+𝑇𝑑𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟 

--- Document Chunk 9154 ---
3.13.9.3.6.3 Note: The reduction of T_indication by a factor is intended to improve performance 

--- Document Chunk 9155 ---
and the feasibility of this reduction is based on experience with real implementations. To 

--- Document Chunk 9156 ---
avoid very low values when T_bs _reduced is small, a minimum is defined for 

--- Document Chunk 9157 ---
T_indication, giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake. 

--- Document Chunk 9158 ---
3.13.9.3.6.4 If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication shall be 

--- Document Chunk 9159 ---
equal to 5s + T_driver. 

--- Document Chunk 9160 ---
3.13.9.3.6.5 If available for use, the service brake  feedback shall not have any effect on T_bs1 

--- Document Chunk 9161 ---
and T_bs2 when calculating the Indication supervision limit: T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be 

--- Document Chunk 9162 ---
set to T_bs in the formulas in 3.13.9.3.2 and 3.13.9.3.3. 

--- Document Chunk 9163 ---
3.13.9.3.6.6 Note 1: This avoids that service brake feedback, while braking to o ne target which 

--- Document Chunk 9164 ---
causes the full locking of T_bs1 and T_bs2 for all the targets, affects the Indication 

--- Document Chunk 9165 ---
supervision limit for another target(s). Otherwise, the indication to the driver could come 

--- Document Chunk 9166 ---
too late. It also avoids its influence on the acceptance criteria of request to shorten MA. 

--- Document Chunk 9167 ---
3.13.9.3.6.7 Note 2: If the service brake feedback is not available for use, T_bs1 and T_bs2 are 

--- Document Chunk 9168 ---
set either to T_bs or to zero, depending on the availability of the service brake command 

--- Document Chunk 9169 ---
(see 3.13.9.3.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.3.5). 

--- Document Chunk 9170 ---
3.13.9.4 Release speed supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 9171 ---
3.13.9.4.1 The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 9172 ---
The EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I 

--- Document Chunk 9173 ---
supervision limit associated to the release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 9174 ---
3.13.9.4.2 Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to 

--- Document Chunk 9175 ---
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be too 

--- Document Chunk 9176 ---
restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance. The 

--- Document Chunk 9177 ---
other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the balise 

--- Document Chunk 9178 ---
when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be given from 

--- Document Chunk 9179 ---
trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the E OA to the 

--- Document Chunk 9180 ---
Supervised Location. 

--- Document Chunk 9181 ---
3.13.9.4.3 With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to: 

--- Document Chunk 9182 ---
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR 

--- Document Chunk 9183 ---
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR 

--- Document Chunk 9184 ---
c) Instruct the on-board to use the national value. 

--- Document Chunk 9185 ---
3.13.9.4.4 In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release 

--- Document Chunk 9186 ---
speed shall be supervised.

3.13.9.4.8.2.1 Note: The above formulas are intended to prevent the calculated release speed from 

--- Document Chunk 9369 ---
fluctuating, according to the distance, speed and acceleration measurements. It allows 

--- Document Chunk 9370 ---
calculating the release speed only once, for a given on-board reference location, unless 

--- Document Chunk 9371 ---
• the train position confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based 

--- Document Chunk 9372 ---
on the assumption that the whole distance between the current on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9373 ---
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET-041 odometer 

--- Document Chunk 9374 ---
performance values and without any update of the on-board reference location, 

--- Document Chunk 9375 ---
or 

--- Document Chunk 9376 ---
• the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET -041 

--- Document Chunk 9377 ---
performance value 

--- Document Chunk 9378 ---
Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), t he release 

--- Document Chunk 9379 ---
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is 

--- Document Chunk 9380 ---
acceptable from an operational point of view. 

--- Document Chunk 9381 ---
3.13.9.4.8.2.2 Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterative algorithm) to compute the release speed is 

--- Document Chunk 9382 ---
an implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 9383 ---
3.13.9.4.9 If the release speed (Figure 52 box 1 gives an example when it is calculated on -board)

exceeds any MRSP element anywhere in the area ( Figure 52 box 2) delimited on one

--- Document Chunk 9436 ---
3.13.10.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 9437 ---
3.13.10.1.1 By comparing the train speed and position to the various supervision limits defined in the 

--- Document Chunk 9438 ---
previous section, the on-board equipment generates braking commands, traction cut-off 

--- Document Chunk 9439 ---
commands and relevant information to the driver. The information displayed to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 9440 ---
is selected according to the fo llowing supervision statuses of the speed and distance 

--- Document Chunk 9441 ---
monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status, Warning status 

--- Document Chunk 9442 ---
and Intervention status. 

--- Document Chunk 9443 ---
3.13.10.1.2 The following types of speed and distance monitoring are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 9444 ---
• Ceiling speed monitoring (CSM) 

--- Document Chunk 9445 ---
• Target speed monitoring (TSM) 

--- Document Chunk 9446 ---
• Release speed monitoring (RSM)

3.13.10.1.3 Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run 

--- Document Chunk 9472 ---
without the need to brake to a target. 

--- Document Chunk 9473 ---
3.13.10.1.4 Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the 

--- Document Chunk 9474 ---
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the train 

--- Document Chunk 9475 ---
brakes to a target. 

--- Document Chunk 9476 ---
3.13.10.1.5 Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to the 

--- Document Chunk 9477 ---
EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 9478 ---
3.13.10.2 General requirements 

--- Document Chunk 9479 ---
3.13.10.2.1 The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the speed 

--- Document Chunk 9480 ---
monitoring. This shall be the estimated speed. 

--- Document Chunk 9481 ---
3.13.10.2.2 Once a Train Interface command (traction cut-off, service brake or emergency brake) is 

--- Document Chunk 9482 ---
triggered, the on-board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is met. 

--- Document Chunk 9483 ---
3.13.10.2.3 If there is no on-board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 9484 ---
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring), whenever 

--- Document Chunk 9485 ---
a service brake command is specified, the emergency brake command shall be triggered 

--- Document Chunk 9486 ---
instead. 

--- Document Chunk 9487 ---
3.13.10.2.4 The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 9488 ---
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to the 

--- Document Chunk 9489 ---
requirements specified for the revocation of service brake command, unless the 

--- Document Chunk 9490 ---
emergency brake command has been also triggered due to an EBI supervision limit. In 

--- Document Chunk 9491 ---
such case, the condition for revoking the emergency brake command due to EBI 

--- Document Chunk 9492 ---
supervision limit shall prevail.

• Step 1: the on -board equipment shall check whether the MRDT obtained from the 

--- Document Chunk 9758 ---
previous step (MRDT0) masks any other target(s) remaining in the list of concerned 

--- Document Chunk 9759 ---
targets, whose target speed is lower than MRDT0. A target is masked by MRDT0 if its 

--- Document Chunk 9760 ---
Indication supervision limit is located in rear of the location of the MRDT 0 Permitted 

--- Document Chunk 9761 ---
speed supervision limit, both at the target speed of MRDT0. It shall be identified using

one of the following formulas, where both the Indication super vision limit and the 

--- Document Chunk 9763 ---

If at least one target is masked by MRDT0, then the MRDT obtained from this step 

--- Document Chunk 9801 ---
(MRDT1) shall be the masked target with its Indication supervision limit the furthest in 

--- Document Chunk 9802 ---
rear of the location of the MRDT0 Permitted speed supervision limit and the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 9803 ---
equipment shall go to the next step. 

--- Document Chunk 9804 ---
If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by MRDT0 

--- Document Chunk 9805 ---
or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of concerned targets, then 

--- Document Chunk 9806 ---
the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e. MRDT0). 

--- Document Chunk 9807 ---
... 

--- Document Chunk 9808 ---
• Step n: the on -board shall apply step n -1, substituting MRDT n-2 with MRDTn-1 and 

--- Document Chunk 9809 ---
checking the list of concerned targets excluding the targets which have been 

--- Document Chunk 9810 ---
preselected as MRDT in all the previous steps (i.e. from MRDT0 to MRDTn-1 inclusive). 

--- Document Chunk 9811 ---
3.13.10.4.2.1 Note 1: the a bove process for the determination of the MRDT ensures that when 

--- Document Chunk 9812 ---
several targets are close to each other it is avoided that a target is displayed after its 

--- Document Chunk 9813 ---
Indication supervision limit has been reached. 

--- Document Chunk 9814 ---
3.13.10.4.2.2 Note 2: when entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one target 

--- Document Chunk 9815 ---
that satisfies the conditions to be selected as MRDT. Afterwards (e.g. due to train 

--- Document Chunk 9816 ---
braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be selected as 

--- Document Chunk 9817 ---
MRDT, which however only means that the target previously selected remains the MRDT 

--- Document Chunk 9818 ---
(see clause 3.13.10.4.5). 

--- Document Chunk 9819 ---
3.13.10.4.2.3 Note 3: if MRDTn-1 is a target at zero speed (e.g. EOA or SvL) , then it is always 

--- Document Chunk 9820 ---
selected as MRDT, i.e. no other target can be selected as MRDT as per step n.

3.13.10.4.16 When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the target 

--- Document Chunk 10322 ---
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering condition t3 defined in Table 8 or 

--- Document Chunk 10323 ---
Table 9 shall be checked for each target in order to determine whether the Indication 

--- Document Chunk 10324 ---
status applies. If it is not the case, the on -board shall immediately set the supervision 

--- Document Chunk 10325 ---
status to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Indication status according to 

--- Document Chunk 10326 ---
clause 3.13.10.4.15. 

--- Document Chunk 10327 ---
3.13.10.4.17 The Normal status is not used in target speed monitoring. However, in case the target 

--- Document Chunk 10328 ---
speed monitoring is entered and the supervision status was previously set to Normal, the 

--- Document Chunk 10329 ---
on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transitions from the Normal 

--- Document Chunk 10330 ---
status, as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.15. 

--- Document Chunk 10331 ---
3.13.10.4.18 Note: Depending upon train speed/position it is possible that for some target(s) none 

--- Document Chunk 10332 ---
of the triggering conditions specified in table 8 and 9 is met. However the conditions to 

--- Document Chunk 10333 ---
enter the target speed monitoring are such (see condition [1] in table 16) that the clauses 

--- Document Chunk 10334 ---
3.13.10.4.16 and 3.13.10.4.17 always allow determining a supervision status.

3.13.10.5.3 The braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to either the EOA or the

--- Document Chunk 10648 ---
3.14.1.1 Note: Whenever the type of brake used is not specified explicitly in the text, it shall be 

--- Document Chunk 10649 ---
interpreted as not being important for technical interoperability and being a property of  

--- Document Chunk 10650 ---
the specific implementation.  

--- Document Chunk 10651 ---
3.14.1.2 In case only the application of (the non -vital) service brake has been commanded a nd 

--- Document Chunk 10652 ---
the service brake fails to be applied, the emergency brake command shall be given. 

--- Document Chunk 10653 ---
3.14.1.3 If the emergency brake command was triggered due to a trip condition (see chapter 4) 

--- Document Chunk 10654 ---
the emergency brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver 

--- Document Chunk 10655 ---
acknowledgement of the trip condition. 

--- Document Chunk 10656 ---
3.14.1.4 For handling of brake commands resulting from the speed and distance monitoring, refer 

--- Document Chunk 10657 ---
to section 3.13.10. 

--- Document Chunk 10658 ---
3.14.1.5 If the brake command was triggered due to roll away protection, unauthorised direction 

--- Document Chunk 10659 ---
movement protection , standstill supervision, or detection of a train movement while 

--- Document Chunk 10660 ---
modifying/revalidating train data or while entering SR speed/distance limits,  the brake 

--- Document Chunk 10661 ---
command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement.  

--- Document Chunk 10662 ---
3.14.1.6 If the brake command was triggered due t o linking error, balise group message 

--- Document Chunk 10663 ---
inconsistency or RAMS related supervision error, the brake command shall be released 

--- Document Chunk 10664 ---
at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 10665 ---
3.14.1.7 If the brake command was triggered due to supervision of the safe radio connection 

--- Document Chunk 10666 ---
(T_NVCONTACT) the brake command shall be released at standstill or if a new message 

--- Document Chunk 10667 ---
has been received from the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 10668 ---
3.14.1.7.1 If the brake command was triggered due to an overpassed reversing distance related to 

--- Document Chunk 10669 ---
a reversing area  or due to any further movement in the direction opposite to the train 

--- Document Chunk 10670 ---
orientation while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the brake command shall be 

--- Document Chunk 10671 ---
released if the reversing distance becomes extended so that the reversing distance is no 

--- Document Chunk 10672 ---
longer overpassed, or at standstill after driver acknowledgement. 

--- Document Chunk 10673 ---
3.14.1.7.2 If the brake c ommand was triggered due to change of Train Data while running (see 

--- Document Chunk 10674 ---
section 5.17 procedure "Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver”), 

--- Document Chunk 10675 ---
the brake command shall be released at standstill and after driver acknowledgement. 

--- Document Chunk 10676 ---
3.14.1.7.3 If the brake command was triggered due to the driver not having acknowledged a mode 

--- Document Chunk 10677 ---
or level change ordered from trackside (see sections 5.7, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.19), the brake 

--- Document Chunk 10678 ---
command shall be released after the driver has acknowledged the mode or level 

--- Document Chunk 10679 ---
transition.

fulfilled. In particular, if several brake command reasons applicable at the same time are 

--- Document Chunk 10714 ---
included in several clauses where a driver acknowledgement is required, there shall be 

--- Document Chunk 10715 ---
as many individual driver acknowledgements required as concerned clauses. 

--- Document Chunk 10716 ---
3.14.1.10.1 In some of the above clauses 3.14.1.3 to 3.14.1.7.7, brake reasons are grouped: in case

the direction controller. 

--- Document Chunk 10744 ---
3.14.2.2 The Roll Away Protection (RAP) shall prevent the train from moving in a direction, which 

--- Document Chunk 10745 ---
conflicts with the current position of the direction controller in the active desk. 

--- Document Chunk 10746 ---
3.14.2.3 If the controller is in neutral position, the RAP shall prev ent forward and reverse 

--- Document Chunk 10747 ---
movements of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 10748 ---
3.14.2.4 As soon as a movement conflicting with the position of the direction controller is detected, 

--- Document Chunk 10749 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall start supervising (see section 3.6.7) whether the train 

--- Document Chunk 10750 ---
travels away, from the locati on when the conflicting movement was detected, over a 

--- Document Chunk 10751 ---
distance longer than the national value for the allowed roll away distance . In case this

3.15.1 RBC/RBC Handover 

--- Document Chunk 10789 ---
3.15.1.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 10790 ---
3.15.1.1.1 The RBC/RBC Handover principles are such that trains are able to pass from one RBC 

--- Document Chunk 10791 ---
area to another automatically (without driver action). 

--- Document Chunk 10792 ---
3.15.1.1.2 This is also granted when, due to a failure in the GSM-R on-board radio communication 

--- Document Chunk 10793 ---
system, the on -board is no longer able to manage two communication sessions 

--- Document Chunk 10794 ---
established through GSM-R at once, while the communication session with the Handing 

--- Document Chunk 10795 ---
Over RBC has been established through GSM -R and the communication session with 

--- Document Chunk 10796 ---
the Accepting RBC can only be established through GSM-R. Thereby, the behaviour of 

--- Document Chunk 10797 ---
the RBCs is independent from such on-board degraded situation. 

--- Document Chunk 10798 ---
3.15.1.1.3 However, such an RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one 

--- Document Chunk 10799 ---
communication session established through GSM-R at once may result in performance 

--- Document Chunk 10800 ---
penalties since it will not be able to “prepare” (session establishment, version 

--- Document Chunk 10801 ---
determination, …) the expected supervision by the Accepting RBC until the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 10802 ---
disconnects from the Handing Over RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 10803 ---
3.15.1.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 10804 ---
3.15.1.1.5 For successive RBC/RBC handovers, it shall be possible for an RBC to act as the 

--- Document Chunk 10805 ---
Accepting and as the Handing Over RBC for the same engine at different RBC/RBC 

--- Document Chunk 10806 ---
border locations simultaneously. 

--- Document Chunk 10807 ---
3.15.1.1.5.1 Note: Successive RBC/RBC handover means that the track side initiates another 

--- Document Chunk 10808 ---
handover procedure while an ongoing handover has not finished. However, from the 

--- Document Chunk 10809 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board point of view, there is only one handover at a time. 

--- Document Chunk 10810 ---
3.15.1.1.5.2 Note: An RBC acting as both Accepting and Handing Over RBC for the same engine 

--- Document Chunk 10811 ---
may as Accepting RBC forward all or parts of route related information it receives as 

--- Document Chunk 10812 ---
Handing Over RBC, but if and how this is done is intentionally not specified. 

--- Document Chunk 10813 ---
3.15.1.1.6 In an RBC/RBC handover, the Accepting RBC is defined by the RBC transition order, 

--- Document Chunk 10814 ---
while the Handing Over RBC is the RBC which the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 10815 ---
considers as the supervising RBC when receiving an RBC transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 10816 ---
3.15.1.1.6.1 Exception: clause 3.15.1.3.2 describes a situation when the current Accepting RBC 

--- Document Chunk 10817 ---
becomes the new Handing Over RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 10818 ---
3.15.1.2 Handing Over RBC 

--- Document Chunk 10819 ---
3.15.1.2.1 When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another RBC

that the train has entered the Accepting RBC area. 

--- Document Chunk 10892 ---
3.15.1.2.7 It is a trackside implementation issue to decide when it is appropriate to send the session 

--- Document Chunk 10893 ---
termination order to the on-board equipment, e.g. when the Handing Over RBC receives 

--- Document Chunk 10894 ---

--- Document Chunk 10937 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall wait until the session with the Handing over 

--- Document Chunk 10938 ---
RBC is terminated due to crossing the border, apply the clause 3.5.6.6 (if relevant), and 

--- Document Chunk 10939 ---
then establish the session with the Accepting RBC  after successful registration of the 

--- Document Chunk 10940 ---
GSM-R Mobile Terminal to the new GSM-R Radio Network (if relevant). 

--- Document Chunk 10941 ---
3.15.1.3.2.1 Justification: in case of loss of safe radio connection with the Handing over RBC, the 

--- Document Chunk 10942 ---
only GSM-R Mobile Terminal still available cannot be pre-empted to set-up a safe radio 

--- Document Chunk 10943 ---

--- Document Chunk 10945 ---
3.15.1.3.2.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC handover 

--- Document Chunk 10946 ---
at a time, therefore a new RBC transition order shall replace a previously received order. 

--- Document Chunk 10947 ---
3.15.1.3.2.3 If, whilst in session with both the Handing Over RBC and the Accepting RBC, the 

--- Document Chunk 10948 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a new RBC transition order with an 

--- Document Chunk 10949 ---
Accepting RBC different than the current on e from the RBC/RBC handover already 

--- Document Chunk 10950 ---
engaged, the communication session with the RBC which is not the currently supervising 

--- Document Chunk 10951 ---
RBC shall be terminated, while the currently supervising RBC remains or becomes the 

--- Document Chunk 10952 ---
Handing Over RBC. Then after the clause s 3.15.1.3.1 and 3.15.1.3.2 (if relevant) shall 

--- Document Chunk 10953 ---
be applied again for the new pair of Handing Over RBC/Accepting RBC.

--- Document Chunk 11002 ---
a) The communication session with this Handing Over RBC has been terminated,

--- Document Chunk 11029 ---
3.15.1.4.1 The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC 

--- Document Chunk 11030 ---
updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions. 

--- Document Chunk 11031 ---
3.15.1.4.2 As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on -board equipment a position report 

--- Document Chunk 11032 ---
and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 11033 ---
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility. 

--- Document Chunk 11034 ---
3.15.1.4.3 When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on -board equipment and

operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect). 

--- Document Chunk 11078 ---
3.15.3.4 Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Split ting and Joining

3.15.4 Reversing of movement direction 

--- Document Chunk 11082 ---
3.15.4.1 It shall be possible to send in advance to an on -board equipment information about

--- Document Chunk 11084 ---
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation.

--- Document Chunk 11183 ---
3.15.5.3 As long as it is displayed, t he driver has the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead 

--- Document Chunk 11184 ---
free request (meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train 

--- Document Chunk 11185 ---
and the next signal or board marking signal position is free). 

--- Document Chunk 11186 ---
3.15.5.4 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop 

--- Document Chunk 11187 ---

--- Document Chunk 11188 ---
3.15.5.5 There is no restrictive consequence by th e on -board system if the driver does not

3.15.7.2 In Levels 0/NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by meta l masses shall be ignored 

--- Document Chunk 11227 ---
for a defined distance (see A .3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the 

--- Document Chunk 11228 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction. 

--- Document Chunk 11229 ---
3.15.7.3 Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all 

--- Document Chunk 11230 ---
excessive big metal masses with track condition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted 

--- Document Chunk 11231 ---
areas. 

--- Document Chunk 11232 ---
3.15.7.4 In Levels 1/2, the BTM alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 

--- Document Chunk 11233 ---
in any of the following cases: 

--- Document Chunk 11234 ---
a) if the “BTM alarm reaction inhibition” is active (see procedure in 5.22), or 

--- Document Chunk 11235 ---
b) if mode is Stand-By. 

--- Document Chunk 11236 ---
3.15.7.5 In all Levels, the BTM alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 

--- Document Chunk 11237 ---
if the track condition “Big Metal Mass” is applicable for the given location (see 3.12.1.3, 

--- Document Chunk 11238 ---
9th bullet). 

--- Document Chunk 11239 ---
3.15.7.6 If the BTM alarm is triggered and not ignored according to 3.15.7.4 or 3.15.7.5, the 

--- Document Chunk 11240 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction. 

--- Document Chunk 11241 ---
3.15.7.6.1 Note: the on -board reaction is left to specific implementation because it contributes to 

--- Document Chunk 11242 ---
the attainment of the global on -board THR, whose apportionment is on -board-

--- Document Chunk 11243 ---
implementation specific. 

--- Document Chunk 11244 ---
3.15.8 Cold Movement Detection 

--- Document Chunk 11245 ---
3.15.8.1 After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 11246 ---
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether th e engine has 

--- Document Chunk 11247 ---
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours. 

--- Document Chunk 11248 ---
3.15.8.1.1 To allow small movements e.g. for coupling in No Power mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 11249 ---
board equipment shall consider that no cold movement has occurred as long as the train 

--- Document Chunk 11250 ---
does not move for mo re than 2m away from the train position stored when No Power 

--- Document Chunk 11251 ---
mode was entered. 

--- Document Chunk 11252 ---
3.15.8.2 When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, if available, 

--- Document Chunk 11253 ---
the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the status of 

--- Document Chunk 11254 ---
information stored by on-board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for details). 

--- Document Chunk 11255 ---
3.15.8.3 Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as not

3.15.9 Virtual Balise Cover 

--- Document Chunk 11275 ---
3.15.9.1 It shall be possible to set and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC). A VBC 

--- Document Chunk 11276 ---
is defined by: 

--- Document Chunk 11277 ---
a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on -board together with the 

--- Document Chunk 11278 ---
area (country or region) in which the VBC is appl icable. The VBC marker and the 

--- Document Chunk 11279 ---
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity. 

--- Document Chunk 11280 ---
b) Its validity period. 

--- Document Chunk 11281 ---
3.15.9.2 During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to 

--- Document Chunk 11282 ---
remove an existing one. 

--- Document Chunk 11283 ---
3.15.9.3 As long as a VBC is stored on-board: 

--- Document Chunk 11284 ---
a) While applying any other clause (with the exception of the ones of section 3.20 

--- Document Chunk 11285 ---
"Juridical data") than this one, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider 

--- Document Chunk 11286 ---
any balise telegram that includes a VBC marker and a country/region identity that both 

--- Document Chunk 11287 ---
match the VBC identity as not received (i.e. as if the balise was physically covered). 

--- Document Chunk 11288 ---
b) As a consequence, n o reaction will be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of 

--- Document Chunk 11289 ---
such balise telegram occur. 

--- Document Chunk 11290 ---
3.15.9.3.1 Since it relies on the system version number of the telegram itself (see chapter 6 for 

--- Document Chunk 11291 ---
details), the check stipulated in 3.15.9.3 a) shall prevail on any system version number 

--- Document Chunk 11292 ---
related check specified in the section 3.17, with the exception of 3.17.3.5 a). 

--- Document Chunk 11293 ---
3.15.9.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives from balise or from driver a new VBC 

--- Document Chunk 11294 ---
with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace the 

--- Document Chunk 11295 ---
previous one, including its validity period. 

--- Document Chunk 11296 ---
3.15.9.5 A VBC shall be retained on -board when the on -board equipment is switched off (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 11297 ---
enters No Power mode) and shall remain applicable when powered on again. It shall be 

--- Document Chunk 11298 ---
deleted when: 

--- Document Chunk 11299 ---
a) it is ordered by trackside, or 

--- Document Chunk 11300 ---
b) its validity period has elapsed, or 

--- Document Chunk 11301 ---
c) it is removed by the driver (during Start of Mission), or 

--- Document Chunk 11302 ---
d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11303 ---
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Not e: this means that the reception of a

--- Document Chunk 11319 ---
3.15.10 Advance display of route related information 

--- Document Chunk 11320 ---
3.15.10.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display an overview of the gradient profile 

--- Document Chunk 11321 ---
(as received from trackside), of the MRSP, of the track conditions  (except the tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 11322 ---
stopping areas, big metal masses, changes of allowed current consumption and station 

--- Document Chunk 11323 ---
platforms), of the first Indication location, if any (only in Ceiling Speed monitoring ), and 

--- Document Chunk 11324 ---
of the EOA/LOA, with the remaining distances referred to the train front end position. 

--- Document Chunk 11325 ---
3.15.10.2 With regards to the MRSP, the track conditions and the EOA/LOA, the remaining 

--- Document Chunk 11326 ---
distances shall be computed taking into account the min safe, the estimated or the max 

--- Document Chunk 11327 ---
safe train front end position depending on their respective supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 11328 ---
3.15.10.3 With regards to the gradient profile, the remaining distances shall be computed taking 

--- Document Chunk 11329 ---
into account the estimated train front end position. 

--- Document Chunk 11330 ---
3.15.10.3.1 With regards to the first Indication location, the remaining distance shall be computed as 

--- Document Chunk 11331 ---
specified in clauses 3.13.10.3.8 and 3.13.10.3.8.1. 

--- Document Chunk 11332 ---
3.15.10.4 The overview of route related information shall be restricted to the elements contained 

--- Document Chunk 11333 ---
within the movement authority and up to the first target at zero speed, if any. 

--- Document Chunk 11334 ---
3.15.10.5 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment applies at least one of the clauses 

--- Document Chunk 11335 ---
3.12.2.4, 3.12.4.7 and 3.12.5.8, the term EOA in this section 3.15.10 shall refer to the

3.15.11 Driving with Automatic Train Operation 

--- Document Chunk 11338 ---
3.15.11.1 In case it is interfaced to an ERTMS/ATO on -board, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 11339 ---
equipment supports automatic driving on lines fitted with an ERTMS/ATO trackside 

--- Document Chunk 11340 ---
subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 11341 ---
3.15.11.2 The driver shall have the possibility, through an ATO selector, to enable/disable the 

--- Document Chunk 11342 ---
automatic driving and the display of the information related to the ERTMS/ATO 

--- Document Chunk 11343 ---
subsystem, with the exception of the ATO data entry/view. The ATO selector position 

--- Document Chunk 11344 ---
("On" or "Stand-by") applicable when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is switched

3.16 Data Consistency 

--- Document Chunk 11361 ---
3.16.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 11362 ---
3.16.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider a message received from the 

--- Document Chunk 11363 ---
trackside as inconsistent if it is not compliant with the ETCS specifications. 

--- Document Chunk 11364 ---
3.16.1.1.1 As a minimum, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consider the use of a spare 

--- Document Chunk 11365 ---
value of a variable as not compliant with the ETCS specifications . Having in mind that 

--- Document Chunk 11366 ---
the trackside messages are presumed to be compliant with the ETCS specifications, it 

--- Document Chunk 11367 ---
is however not in th e scope of this specification to list the other checks that the 

--- Document Chunk 11368 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment might consider to determine that a message is not 

--- Document Chunk 11369 ---
compliant with them. 

--- Document Chunk 11370 ---
3.16.1.2 For the other inconsistency criteria, reactions and other functionality related to the 

--- Document Chunk 11371 ---
consistency of the information from balises, see 3.16.2. 

--- Document Chunk 11372 ---
3.16.1.3 For the other inconsistency criteria, reactions and other functionality related to the 

--- Document Chunk 11373 ---
consistency of the information from radio, see 3.16.3. 

--- Document Chunk 11374 ---
3.16.1.4 Unless stated otherwise, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall reject a message 

--- Document Chunk 11375 ---
that fulfils any inconsistency criteria. 

--- Document Chunk 11376 ---
3.16.2 Balises 

--- Document Chunk 11377 ---
3.16.2.1 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 11378 ---
3.16.2.1.1 The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram. 

--- Document Chunk 11379 ---
3.16.2.1.2 The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11380 ---
is called a balise group message.  

--- Document Chunk 11381 ---
3.16.2.1.2.1 Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message 

--- Document Chunk 11382 ---
coincide. 

--- Document Chunk 11383 ---
3.16.2.1.3 Intentionally deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 11384 ---
3.16.2.2 General 

--- Document Chunk 11385 ---
3.16.2.2.1 If the on-board is not able to recognise whether a balise group is linked or unlinked (if 

--- Document Chunk 11386 ---
none of the balises  in the balise group can be read correctly), it shall consider it as 

--- Document Chunk 11387 ---
unlinked. 

--- Document Chunk 11388 ---
3.16.2.2.2 A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if 

--- Document Chunk 11389 ---
a) No balise is detected (see SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  within the 

--- Document Chunk 11390 ---
maximum distance between balises from the previous balise in the group, or 

--- Document Chunk 11391 ---
b) A following balise within the group is received, or

--- Document Chunk 11406 ---
information in the following cases:

--- Document Chunk 11409 ---
b) If the location reference of the expected balise group is not detected (see SUBSET-

--- Document Chunk 11414 ---
equipment shall consider the criterion 3.16.2.3.1 b) as fulfilled  only once the min safe 

--- Document Chunk 11415 ---
antenna position has passed the last possible location of the balise group plus 1.3m, for 

--- Document Chunk 11416 ---
a time equal to:

group, and is detected (see SUBSET -036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  within the 

--- Document Chunk 11425 ---
expectation window, no linking reaction shall be applied. 

--- Document Chunk 11426 ---
3.16.2.4 Balise Group Message Consistency 

--- Document Chunk 11427 ---
3.16.2.4.1 The on-board shall react according to the linking reaction when  the message from a 

--- Document Chunk 11428 ---
balise group announced by linking, whose location reference was detected (see 

--- Document Chunk 11429 ---
SUBSET-036 sections 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2)  inside its expectation window or whose

expectation window is currently supervised , fulfils the general inconsistency criterion 

--- Document Chunk 11431 ---
3.16.1.1 or any of the following inconsistency criteria: 

--- Document Chunk 11432 ---
a) A balise is missed inside the group.

--- Document Chunk 11463 ---
b) in all other cases and if an error in the reading of the balise group occurs, the linking

--- Document Chunk 11465 ---
expected one (i.e. the one which contains repositioning information valid for the train 

--- Document Chunk 11466 ---
orientation) because e.g. one of the missed or not decoded balise(s) does contain the

repositioning information valid for the train orientation or e.g. although a balise

d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7)

clause 3.16.2.4.4, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment:  

--- Document Chunk 11479 ---
a) shall not reject the message and shall not command application of the service brake

3.16.2.4.4.3 Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the service brake is applied, the driver shall be 

--- Document Chunk 11508 ---
informed that this is due to a balise group message consistency problem. 

--- Document Chunk 11509 ---
3.16.2.4.4.4 Exception: Concerning clause 3.16.2.4.4, if the balise group was the last announced 

--- Document Chunk 11510 ---
one by linking and the linking consistency is no longer checked as per 3.4.4.4.6 a), the 

--- Document Chunk 11511 ---
on-board shall apply the clause 3.16.2.4.1 instead. 

--- Document Chunk 11512 ---
3.16.2.4.5 A message counter shall be attached to each balise telegram indicating which balise 

--- Document Chunk 11513 ---
group message the telegram fits to. 

--- Document Chunk 11514 ---
3.16.2.4.6 Instead of a message counter corresponding to a given balise group message, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 11515 ---
be possible to identify a telegram as always fitting all possible messages of the group. 

--- Document Chunk 11516 ---
3.16.2.4.6.1 It shall also be possible to identify a telegram as never fitting any message of the 

--- Document Chunk 11517 ---
group.

3.16.2.4.7 Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message, 

--- Document Chunk 11519 ---
excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2.4.6 and the ones that are not used by the on-

--- Document Chunk 11520 ---
board to compose the message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2), if their values are not all identical, or 

--- Document Chunk 11521 ---
at least one of  them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, th e message shall be considered as 

--- Document Chunk 11522 ---
inconsistent. 

--- Document Chunk 11523 ---
3.16.2.4.7.1 In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram 

--- Document Chunk 11524 ---
complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, the message shall also be considered as inconsistent. 

--- Document Chunk 11525 ---
3.16.2.4.8 It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 11526 ---
the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message or a 

--- Document Chunk 11527 ---
RIU message including the information "default balise/loop/RIU information". 

--- Document Chunk 11528 ---
3.16.2.4.8.1 If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the on -

--- Document Chunk 11529 ---
board includes the information “default balise information”, the on-board shall ignore any 

--- Document Chunk 11530 ---
other information included i n this telegram and shall consider information from the 

--- Document Chunk 11531 ---
telegram not containing “default balise information". 

--- Document Chunk 11532 ---
3.16.2.4.8.2 When duplicated balises are both received and decoded correctly, and both, or none 

--- Document Chunk 11533 ---
of them, contain "default balise information", the ERTMS/ETCS o n-board equipment

3.16.2.5 Unlinked Balise Group Message Consistency 

--- Document Chunk 11553 ---
3.16.2.5.1 The on-board equipment shall command application of the service brake when  the 

--- Document Chunk 11554 ---
message received from a balise group marked as unlinked fulfils the general 

--- Document Chunk 11555 ---
inconsistency criterion 3.16.1.1 or any of the following inconsistency criteria: 

--- Document Chunk 11556 ---
a) A balise is missed inside the unlinked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 11557 ---
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC). 

--- Document Chunk 11558 ---
c) Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 11559 ---
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7) 

--- Document Chunk 11560 ---
3.16.2.5.1.1 Exceptions: Even if it considers the message as inconsistent due to either a) or b) of 

--- Document Chunk 11561 ---
clause 3.16.2.5.1, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment: 

--- Document Chunk 11562 ---
a)  shall not reject the message and shall not command application of the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 11563 ---
if the balise missed, or not decoded, is duplicated within the balise group, t he 

--- Document Chunk 11564 ---
duplicating one is correctly read and contains: 

--- Document Chunk 11565 ---
• directional information while the orientation of the balise group can still be 

--- Document Chunk 11566 ---
evaluated, or 

--- Document Chunk 11567 ---
• only information valid for both directions, or 

--- Document Chunk 11568 ---
• neither directional information nor information valid for both directions, or 

--- Document Chunk 11569 ---
• only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS, or 

--- Document Chunk 11570 ---
• only data to be used by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  together with other 

--- Document Chunk 11571 ---
information valid for both directions. 

--- Document Chunk 11572 ---
b) shall not command application of the service brake if the telegram correctly read from 

--- Document Chunk 11573 ---
another balise of the group contains the information “Inhibition of balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11574 ---
message consistency reaction”. 

--- Document Chunk 11575 ---
3.16.2.5.2 Concerning clause 3.16.2.5.1, if the service brake is applied, the location based

3.16.2.6 Linking Reactions 

--- Document Chunk 11593 ---
3.16.2.6.1 When the linking reaction leads to train trip or a service brake application, the driver shall 

--- Document Chunk 11594 ---
be informed that the intervention is due to data consistency problem with the expecte d 

--- Document Chunk 11595 ---
balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 11596 ---
3.16.2.6.2 If the service brake is initiated due to the linking reaction, the location based information 

--- Document Chunk 11597 ---
stored on-board shall be shortened to the current position when the train has reached 

--- Document Chunk 11598 ---
standstill. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall be 

--- Document Chunk 11599 ---
shortened.

3.16.2.7.1 Mitigation of balise detection degradation 

--- Document Chunk 11602 ---
3.16.2.7.1.1 If no balise is detected between the start of the expectation window of a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11603 ---
announced by linking and the end of the expectation window of the next balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11604 ---
announced by linking, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall command the service brake and 

--- Document Chunk 11605 ---
the driver shall be informed. At standstill, the location based information stored on-board 

--- Document Chunk 11606 ---
shall be shortened to the current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list 

--- Document Chunk 11607 ---
of information, which shall be shortened. 

--- Document Chunk 11608 ---
3.16.2.7.2 Mitigation of balise cross-talk while expecting repositioning information 

--- Document Chunk 11609 ---
3.16.2.7.2.1 If repositioning is announced and the expected  repositioning balise group has been 

--- Document Chunk 11610 ---
received, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall keep looking for a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11611 ---
that satisfies the same criteria as this previously expected and already received 

--- Document Chunk 11612 ---
repositioning balise group, until one of the following events occurs: 

--- Document Chunk 11613 ---
a) the min safe antenna position leaves the expectation window of the repositioning 

--- Document Chunk 11614 ---
balise group that was announced and already received 

--- Document Chunk 11615 ---
b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is received. 

--- Document Chunk 11616 ---
3.16.2.7.2.2 If a second balise group is received that satisfies the same criteria as the previously 

--- Document Chunk 11617 ---
expected and already received repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 11618 ---
equipment shall command the service brake  and the driver shall be informed . At 

--- Document Chunk 11619 ---
standstill, the location based information stored on -board shall be shortened to the 

--- Document Chunk 11620 ---
current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which shall 

--- Document Chunk 11621 ---
be shortened. 

--- Document Chunk 11622 ---
3.16.2.7.2.3 Note: this function is independent from linking consistency check function, i.e. the 

--- Document Chunk 11623 ---
rules related to linking always apply. This means that once a repositioning balise group 

--- Document Chunk 11624 ---
has been received and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 11625 ---
on-board equipment will start expecting the first balise group ann ounced in this new 

--- Document Chunk 11626 ---
linking information in parallel with the monitoring specified in 3.16.2.7.2.1.

--- Document Chunk 11643 ---
a) Checks performed by Euroradio protocol (see Subset-037) 

--- Document Chunk 11644 ---

3.16.3.2 Time stamping 

--- Document Chunk 11653 ---
3.16.3.2.1 The trackside shall always transmit its information with reference to the train time. 

--- Document Chunk 11654 ---
3.16.3.2.2 To time-stamp its messages, the trackside shall make a safe estimation of the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 11655 ---
time, based on the time -stamp of the received messages and the internal processing 

--- Document Chunk 11656 ---
times. The estimation shall be made in such a way that the on-board time estimated by 

--- Document Chunk 11657 ---
the trackside shall not be in advance of the real on-board time. 

--- Document Chunk 11658 ---
3.16.3.2.3 Wrap around of the onboard timer can occur during a communication session and shall 

--- Document Chunk 11659 ---
have no impact on system behaviour. 

--- Document Chunk 11660 ---
3.16.3.3 Supervision of Sequence 

--- Document Chunk 11661 ---
3.16.3.3.1 The trackside shall time -stamp a message with a value corresponding to the ti me of 

--- Document Chunk 11662 ---
sending. 

--- Document Chunk 11663 ---
3.16.3.3.2 There shall always be a time stamp increment between consecutive messages. 

--- Document Chunk 11664 ---
3.16.3.3.3 The on-board shall consider a message as inconsistent if its time stamp is lower than or 

--- Document Chunk 11665 ---
equal to the time stamp of the preceding message. 

--- Document Chunk 11666 ---
3.16.3.3.3.1 Intentionally deleted.

3.17.2 Determination of the operated system version 

--- Document Chunk 11812 ---
3.17.2.1 The on -board equipment shall be able to operate with (i.e. shall support) any of  the 

--- Document Chunk 11813 ---
ERTMS/ETCS system version numbers X included in its envelope of supported system 

--- Document Chunk 11814 ---
versions, as defined in chapter 6. 

--- Document Chunk 11815 ---
3.17.2.1.1 Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 11816 ---
always operate the highest system version number Y defined in its envelope of supported 

--- Document Chunk 11817 ---
system versions , regardless of the system version number Y transmitted by the 

--- Document Chunk 11818 ---
trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 11819 ---
3.17.2.2 The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it shall 

--- Document Chunk 11820 ---
behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version (refer 

--- Document Chunk 11821 ---
to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one introduced in 

--- Document Chunk 11822 ---
this release of the SRS). 

--- Document Chunk 11823 ---
3.17.2.3 The on -board equipment shall determine the operated system version  number X , in 

--- Document Chunk 11824 ---
relation to non-RBC trackside constituents, as the highest system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 11825 ---
transmitted in the telegrams forming a balise group message (i.e. the telegrams which 

--- Document Chunk 11826 ---
are not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Telegram" of the Table 17), or 

--- Document Chunk 11827 ---
as the system version number X transmitted by a loop whose message is not ignored as 

--- Document Chunk 11828 ---
per a clause referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17 , or as the system 

--- Document Chunk 11829 ---
version number X transmitted by an RIU, if this system version number X is higher than 

--- Document Chunk 11830 ---
the currently operated one. 

--- Document Chunk 11831 ---
3.17.2.4 It shall be possible from balise group to order the on -board equipment to operate a 

--- Document Chunk 11832 ---
system version. 

--- Document Chunk 11833 ---
3.17.2.5 Once a balise group message has been received, if one of the telegrams forming the 

--- Document Chunk 11834 ---
message (i.e. a telegram which is not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column 

--- Document Chunk 11835 ---
"Telegram" of the Table 17) includes an  order to operate system version which would 

--- Document Chunk 11836 ---
not be ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Individual information" of the 

--- Document Chunk 11837 ---
Table 17, the on-board equipment shall immediately operate the system version number 

--- Document Chunk 11838 ---
X given in the order, regardless of the clauses 3.17.2.3 and 3.17.2.6 . After the order is 

--- Document Chunk 11839 ---
executed, the clauses 3.17.2.3 and 3.17.2.6 shall again apply for any further received 

--- Document Chunk 11840 ---
balise group/loop message or any further contacted RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 11841 ---
3.17.2.5.1 Note: the system version order is to be used wherever it is necessary to enforce an 

--- Document Chunk 11842 ---
operated system version number X lower than the currently operated one. 

--- Document Chunk 11843 ---
3.17.2.6 If a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read  from a 

--- Document Chunk 11844 ---
balise group/loop and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set of national 

--- Document Chunk 11845 ---
values, the on -board equipment shall consider the highest system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 11846 ---
transmitted in the telegrams forming the balise group message (i.e. telegrams which are 

--- Document Chunk 11847 ---
not ignored as per a clause referred to in the column "Telegram" of the Table 17) or the 

--- Document Chunk 11848 ---
system version number X transmitted by the loop whose message is not ignored as per 

--- Document Chunk 11849 ---
a clause referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17 , as the operated one and 

--- Document Chunk 11850 ---
shall comply again with requirement 3.17.2.3. For balise groups, the on-board equipment

X of the RBC shall take precedence on the operated system version in relation to non -

--- Document Chunk 11871 ---
RBC constituents and on system version ordered from balise group; the operated system 

--- Document Chunk 11872 ---
version number X shall be determined according to the following principles: 

--- Document Chunk 11873 ---
a) if the on-board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2 area), the 

--- Document Chunk 11874 ---
RBC system version number X shall be operated when the transition to level 2 is 

--- Document Chunk 11875 ---
executed; 

--- Document Chunk 11876 ---
b) if the on -board equipment is in level 2 (SoM procedure or order received from 

--- Document Chunk 11877 ---
trackside), the RBC system version number X shall be operated immediately; 

--- Document Chunk 11878 ---
c) in case of session established with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the 

--- Document Chunk 11879 ---
accepting RBC system version number X shall be operated as soon as the train has 

--- Document Chunk 11880 ---
passed the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end; 

--- Document Chunk 11881 ---
d) in case the on-board equipment switches from level 2 to another level (e.g. exit from 

--- Document Chunk 11882 ---
a level 2 area), the system version control in relation to non -RBC constituents shall 

--- Document Chunk 11883 ---
be again applied and the balise group orders shall be again considered; 

--- Document Chunk 11884 ---
e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front 

--- Document Chunk 11885 ---
end and no session is established with the accepting RBC, the system version control 

--- Document Chunk 11886 ---
in relation to non-RBC constituents shall be again applied and the balise group orders 

--- Document Chunk 11887 ---
shall be again considered. 

--- Document Chunk 11888 ---
3.17.2.8.1 For item a): if the switch from level 0, NTC or 1 to level 2 results from an immediate level 

--- Document Chunk 11889 ---
transition order or a conditional level transition order received from balise group and if 

--- Document Chunk 11890 ---
the RBC system version number X is different from the system versi on number X 

--- Document Chunk 11891 ---
operated before the level transition, the checks of the raw balise group message and the 

--- Document Chunk 11892 ---
evaluation of its whole content shall be performed taking into account the RBC system 

--- Document Chunk 11893 ---
version and shall substitute the checks and evaluation performed befo rehand with 

--- Document Chunk 11894 ---
regards to the previously operated system version. 

--- Document Chunk 11895 ---
3.17.2.8.2 For item d): if the switch from level 2 to another level results from an immediate level

transition order or a conditional level transition order received from balise group, the 

--- Document Chunk 11897 ---
clauses 3.17.2. 3, 3.17.2.5 and 3.17.2.6 shall be immediately checked to determine 

--- Document Chunk 11898 ---
whether a change of operated system version occurs. If so, the checks of the raw balise 

--- Document Chunk 11899 ---
group message and the evaluation of its whole content shall be performed taking into

--- Document Chunk 11915 ---
3.17.2.9.1 If the on-board equipment loses the information (failure situation), the highest supported

system version shall be used. 

--- Document Chunk 11917 ---
3.17.3 Handling of trackside data in relation to system version 

--- Document Chunk 11918 ---
3.17.3.1 Every telegram transmitted by a balise, and every message transmitted by Euroloop and 

--- Document Chunk 11919 ---
Radio Infill Unit shall contain only the data related to one system version. It is not allowed 

--- Document Chunk 11920 ---
for the balise, Euroloop and Radio Infill Unit to transmit data correspondent to several 

--- Document Chunk 11921 ---
system versions. 

--- Document Chunk 11922 ---
3.17.3.2 All messages transmitted by an RBC shall contain data only related to one major system 

--- Document Chunk 11923 ---
version X and, within one communication session, they shall contain only data for one 

--- Document Chunk 11924 ---
minor system version Y. 

--- Document Chunk 11925 ---
3.17.3.3 Except for the balises whose telegram is ignored as per clause 3.14.3.6 or 3.15.9.3 a), 

--- Document Chunk 11926 ---
the on-board equipment shall check the system version transmitted by the balises/loops 

--- Document Chunk 11927 ---
and then shall determine the operated system version prior to any further checks (data 

--- Document Chunk 11928 ---
consistency, ...) and evaluation of the oth er data included in a balise group/loop 

--- Document Chunk 11929 ---
message, as they may depend on the system version. 

--- Document Chunk 11930 ---
3.17.3.4 If any of the further checks that are referred to in the column "Message" of the Table 17 

--- Document Chunk 11931 ---
leads to the rejection of the whole balise group/loop message, any change o f operated 

--- Document Chunk 11932 ---
system version due to the application of clause 3.17.2.3, 3.17.2.5 or 3.17.2.6 shall be 

--- Document Chunk 11933 ---
revoked by the on -board equipment, i.e. the operated system version prior to the 

--- Document Chunk 11934 ---
reception of the balise group/loop message remains unchanged. 

--- Document Chunk 11935 ---
3.17.3.4.1 Note: the clau ses 3.17.3.3 and 3.17.3.4 imply that on reception of a balise group/loop 

--- Document Chunk 11936 ---
message the on -board equipment checks first the information which may impact the 

--- Document Chunk 11937 ---
determination of the operated system version as per clauses 3.17.2.3, 3.17.2.5 or 

--- Document Chunk 11938 ---
3.17.2.6 (i.e. the s ystem version transmitted by the balises/loop/RIU, the country or 

--- Document Chunk 11939 ---
region identifiers of a set of National Values applicable immediately and a system version 

--- Document Chunk 11940 ---
order). Then, upon a change of operated system version, the other information included 

--- Document Chunk 11941 ---
in the messa ge received from the balise group or loop will be checked and evaluated 

--- Document Chunk 11942 ---
considering the newly operated system version. However, should the whole balise

number X supported by the on-board equipment, the information from this balise shall 

--- Document Chunk 11972 ---
be ignored, the train shall be tripped and an indication shall be given to the driver.

Table 17: Check of raw data received from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 12729 ---
A.3.3.2 With the exception of the clauses/sections referred to in Table 17 and of the clause s 

--- Document Chunk 12730 ---
3.16.3.5.1, 3.17.2.3 , 3.17.2.5, 3.17.2.6 and 3.17.3.3, all the clauses in this specification 

--- Document Chunk 12731 ---
and in the SUBSET-035, in which trackside information is referred to (through the terms 

--- Document Chunk 12732 ---
“balise”, “telegram”, “balise group [message]”, “message”, “[name of] information”...), 

--- Document Chunk 12733 ---
shall be applied assuming that the information has not been ignored/rejected by the 

--- Document Chunk 12734 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment due to all the checks listed in Table 17. 

--- Document Chunk 12735 ---
A.3.3.3 Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: “If a <consistent> 

--- Document Chunk 12736 ---
message <composed with telegrams that have passed the system ve rsion check, that 

--- Document Chunk 12737 ---
have not been ignored because of a VBC, that have not been ignored because of 

--- Document Chunk 12738 ---
duplication, and that have been received while no movement opposite to the authorised 

--- Document Chunk 12739 ---
direction was performed> has been received <with one of its telegrams comp osing it> 

--- Document Chunk 12740 ---
containing the information “default balise information” <which is valid for the train 

--- Document Chunk 12741 ---
orientation (or the balise group crossing direction for NL or SL engines) and which has 

--- Document Chunk 12742 ---
passed the level and mode filters>, the driver shall be informed.” 

--- Document Chunk 12743 ---
A.3.3.4 Example 2: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment will 

--- Document Chunk 12744 ---
not apply requirements in relation to the content of the telegram or the message such 

--- Document Chunk 12745 ---
as: 

--- Document Chunk 12746 ---
• clause 3.6.2.2.2 a), in case the balise group message is rejected because  

--- Document Chunk 12747 ---
inconsistent (e.g. according to 3.16.2.4.1), it does not become LRBG 

--- Document Chunk 12748 ---
• clause 3.17.2.3, in case the balise telegram is ignored because of its system version 

--- Document Chunk 12749 ---
number (e.g. according to 3.17.3.5 d)), this latter will not affect the system version 

--- Document Chunk 12750 ---
operated by the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 12751 ---
• clause 3.18.2.5 2nd bullet, in case a message from a balise group marked as linked 

--- Document Chunk 12752 ---
is rejected because the balise group was not announced by linking (see 3.16.2.4.3), 

--- Document Chunk 12753 ---
the balise group country or region identifier will not be compared with the o ne(s) of 

--- Document Chunk 12754 ---
the currently applicable set of National Values 

--- Document Chunk 12755 ---
A.3.3.5 Example 3: as a result of the clause A.3.3.2, the clause 3.4.1.1 (definition of a balise 

--- Document Chunk 12756 ---
group) has to be understood as follows: “A balise group consists of between one and 

--- Document Chunk 12757 ---
eight balises shar ing the same balise group identity <and which are not covered by a 

--- Document Chunk 12758 ---
VBC (i.e. whose telegrams will not be ignored by the on -board) at a certain moment in 

--- Document Chunk 12759 ---
time>”. Therefore when, for migration purposes, more than one instance of balises with 

--- Document Chunk 12760 ---
the same internal number but with different VBC markers are used in a cluster of balises, 

--- Document Chunk 12761 ---
the number of balises inside the group that is indicated in each balise telegram shou ld

A.3.4 Handling of Accepted and Stored Information in specific 

--- Document Chunk 12776 ---
Situations 

--- Document Chunk 12777 ---
A.3.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 12778 ---
A.3.4.1.1 All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special 

--- Document Chunk 12779 ---
situations. 

--- Document Chunk 12780 ---
A.3.4.1.2 The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are: 

--- Document Chunk 12781 ---
a) the acceptance of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2 b)); 

--- Document Chunk 12782 ---
b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4); 

--- Document Chunk 12783 ---
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2); 

--- Document Chunk 12784 ---
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time -out 

--- Document Chunk 12785 ---
(3.8.4.4.2) ; 

--- Document Chunk 12786 ---
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2); 

--- Document Chunk 12787 ---
f) a request to shorten MA is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2); 

--- Document Chunk 12788 ---
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill 

--- Document Chunk 12789 ---
(3.16.2.5.2); 

--- Document Chunk 12790 ---
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ; 

--- Document Chunk 12791 ---
i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service brake 

--- Document Chunk 12792 ---
and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ; 

--- Document Chunk 12793 ---
j) the train category, axle load  category, loading gauge or traction system is changed 

--- Document Chunk 12794 ---
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ; 

--- Document Chunk 12795 ---
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ; 

--- Document Chunk 12796 ---
l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at standstill 

--- Document Chunk 12797 ---
(3.16.2.7) 

--- Document Chunk 12798 ---
m) inconsistency in a balise group marked as linked and linking consistency is not 

--- Document Chunk 12799 ---
checked onboard and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.4.4.2) 

--- Document Chunk 12800 ---
n) the Limit of Authority becomes an End of Authority and the on -board considers an 

--- Document Chunk 12801 ---
SvL (3.8.4.3.2) 

--- Document Chunk 12802 ---
o) the safe consist length information acquired from external source becomes 

--- Document Chunk 12803 ---
unavailable (4.4.21.1.12) 

--- Document Chunk 12804 ---
A.3.4.1.3 Depending on the situation, the action shall be one of the following: 

--- Document Chunk 12805 ---
a) data is deleted,

A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations 

--- Document Chunk 13041 ---
A.3.5.1 Regards the following actions executed in reference to location based information 

--- Document Chunk 13042 ---
received from trackside, the on -board equipment shall , by exception to the other 

--- Document Chunk 13043 ---
requirements in this document,  ensure that the action related to passing a location is 

--- Document Chunk 13044 ---
neither reverted, nor executed twice in case of reverse movement (initiated by driver or 

--- Document Chunk 13045 ---
due to roll-away) and sub-sequent forward movement, or in case of adjustment of train 

--- Document Chunk 13046 ---
position and relocation on passing a  balise group that becomes SOLR, which result in 

--- Document Chunk 13047 ---
a new train position situated in rear of the location which triggered the action: 

--- Document Chunk 13048 ---
• Applying new National Values (see 3.18.2.3) 

--- Document Chunk 13049 ---
• Request to acknowledge new l evel on entering the acknowledgement area (see 

--- Document Chunk 13050 ---
5.10.4.1 a)), actions related to passing the level transition border (see 3.5.3.8 d),

3.6.5.1.4 f), 5.10.1.5, 5.10.3.3.3, 5.10.3.6.2, 5.10.3.7.5, 5.10.3.10.3) 

--- Document Chunk 13052 ---
• Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3.4.3.1) 

--- Document Chunk 13053 ---
• Mode transition due to passing the beginning (see 3.12.4.5 together with 4.6.3 [34], 

--- Document Chunk 13054 ---

action is automatically reverted, but that the other requirements in this document strictly 

--- Document Chunk 13073 ---
apply. For instance:

Page 229/252 

--- Document Chunk 13084 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13085 ---
• In case the reverse movement or the relocation brings back the max safe antenna 

--- Document Chunk 13086 ---
position in rear of the start location of the big metal mass area, the on-board will stop 

--- Document Chunk 13087 ---
ignoring the alarms which may be triggered by big metal masses (i.e. the clauses 

--- Document Chunk 13088 ---
3.12.1.2.1.2 and 3.12.1.3 apply) 

--- Document Chunk 13089 ---
• In case the reverse movement or the relocation brings back the min safe front end in 

--- Document Chunk 13090 ---
rear of an unprotected LX end location, the on-board will take again into account the 

--- Document Chunk 13091 ---
LX speed restriction (i.e. 3.13.10.2.8 applies) and display again the unprotected LX 

--- Document Chunk 13092 ---
status (i.e. 5.16.1.5 applies) 

--- Document Chunk 13093 ---
• The transition to TR mode on pass ing the EOA/LOA will never be reverted, even if 

--- Document Chunk 13094 ---
the train moves backwards in rear of the EOA/LOA location. Reason: on purpose, no 

--- Document Chunk 13095 ---
such transition back to FS/OS/LS is specified in sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3. 

--- Document Chunk 13096 ---
• The transition from CSM to TSM on passing the Indic ation supervision limit will not 

--- Document Chunk 13097 ---
be reverted in case of relocation that brings back the train front end in rear of the 

--- Document Chunk 13098 ---
Indication supervision limit. Reason: it has been specified in that way for obvious 

--- Document Chunk 13099 ---
ergonomic reasons (see 3.13.10.6.1). 

--- Document Chunk 13100 ---
A.3.5.2 A maximum time Tn (see Subset-036 clause 4.2.9) after it has received a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 13101 ---
message (i.e. a maximum time Tn after  it has received the last balise telegram of the 

--- Document Chunk 13102 ---
balise group), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment  shall not consider any action 

--- Document Chunk 13103 ---
related to passing an EOA (only in level 1), an LOA, or a former EOA/LOA located in 

--- Document Chunk 13104 ---
advance of the train position measured at the time of reception of this last telegram, until 

--- Document Chunk 13105 ---
the content of the message has been taken into account. 

--- Document Chunk 13106 ---
A.3.5.2.1 Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, 

--- Document Chunk 13107 ---
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the 

--- Document Chunk 13108 ---
EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the replacement 

--- Document Chunk 13109 ---
of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on -board as happening before the min safe 

--- Document Chunk 13110 ---
antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.7 applies). 

--- Document Chunk 13111 ---
A.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA /LOA 

--- Document Chunk 13112 ---
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when the 

--- Document Chunk 13113 ---
min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead 

--- Document Chunk 13114 ---
to the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. In other 

--- Document Chunk 13115 ---
terms, both the deletion of the former EOA/LOA and the end of override procedure (see 

--- Document Chunk 13116 ---
5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on -board as simultaneously happening 

--- Document Chunk 13117 ---
before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location. 

--- Document Chunk 13118 ---
A.3.5.2.3 Example 3: in level 2, the crossing of the LOA location with the min safe front end before 

--- Document Chunk 13119 ---
an immediate level transition order to level NTC or level 0 (received when the min safe 

--- Document Chunk 13120 ---
front end was in rear of the LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other 

--- Document Chunk 13121 ---
terms the deletion of the MA (and therefore the deletion of the LOA) due to the level 

--- Document Chunk 13122 ---
change is considered by the on -board as happening before the min safe front end 

--- Document Chunk 13123 ---
crosses the LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.6 a) applies).

A.3.6.1.1 When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied 

--- Document Chunk 13138 ---
by trackside information no longer used, i.e., the related on-board functionality has been 

--- Document Chunk 13139 ---
completed, shall be made available immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 13140 ---
A.3.6.1.1.1 Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity 

--- Document Chunk 13141 ---
available on-board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information stored 

--- Document Chunk 13142 ---
on-board given in Subset 040. 

--- Document Chunk 13143 ---
A.3.6.2 Exception 

--- Document Chunk 13144 ---
A.3.6.2.1 Following information shall remain stored on-board for a distance defined by a fixed value 

--- Document Chunk 13145 ---
in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train: 

--- Document Chunk 13146 ---
• location dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR 

--- Document Chunk 13147 ---
(see 3.11.2.2), 

--- Document Chunk 13148 ---
• gradient information, 

--- Document Chunk 13149 ---
• reduced adhesion information received from trackside, 

--- Document Chunk 13150 ---
• Track condition “Big metal masses”, 

--- Document Chunk 13151 ---
• MA Section entry points and their associated Section timer stop locations. 

--- Document Chunk 13152 ---
A.3.6.2.1.1 Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement: 

--- Document Chunk 13153 ---
• With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”,  the stored information 

--- Document Chunk 13154 ---
allows the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to calculate speed supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 13155 ---
after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver), 

--- Document Chunk 13156 ---
• Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to 

--- Document Chunk 13157 ---
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track, 

--- Document Chunk 13158 ---
• The MA Section information is needed to apply the clause 3.8.4.2.4 in case of reverse 

--- Document Chunk 13159 ---
movement in rear of an MA Section timer stop location. 

--- Document Chunk 13160 ---
A.3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the Roll Away Protection or the Unauthorised 

--- Document Chunk 13161 ---
Direction Movement Protection is determined by a National/Default val ue.  This is also 

--- Document Chunk 13162 ---
true for a reverse movement in Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the 

--- Document Chunk 13163 ---
train will not stop immediately. In order to keep the on-board functionality simple, a fixed 

--- Document Chunk 13164 ---
distance value was chosen to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where 

--- Document Chunk 13165 ---
the above information is no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is 

--- Document Chunk 13166 ---
made available again. 

--- Document Chunk 13167 ---
A.3.7  Calculation of the basic deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 13168 ---

where λ is the brake percentage defined as part of Train Data. 

--- Document Chunk 13183 ---
A.3.7.2 The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm that 

--- Document Chunk 13184 ---
will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake. 

--- Document Chunk 13185 ---
A.3.7.3 The speed limit for the first step shall be calculated as V_lim = x * λoy. 

--- Document Chunk 13186 ---
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h 

--- Document Chunk 13187 ---
x = 16.85

--- Document Chunk 13189 ---
A.3.7.4 The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as AD_0 = A * λo + B

--- Document Chunk 13194 ---
polynomials of the third order with the following format: 

--- Document Chunk 13195 ---
AD_n = a3_n * λo3 + a2_n * λo2 + a1_n * λo + a0_n

A.3.10 Service brake feedback 

--- Document Chunk 13369 ---
A.3.10.1 The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and 

--- Document Chunk 13370 ---
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves. 

--- Document Chunk 13371 ---
A.3.10.2 The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if: 

--- Document Chunk 13372 ---
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND 

--- Document Chunk 13373 ---
b) The national value does not inhibit its use. 

--- Document Chunk 13374 ---
A.3.10.3 Two different types of feedback fr om the service brake are specified, main brake pipe 

--- Document Chunk 13375 ---
pressure and brake cylinder pressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake 

--- Document Chunk 13376 ---
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted into 

--- Document Chunk 13377 ---
a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way: 

--- Document Chunk 13378 ---
p = fictive main brake pipe pressure (kPa) 

--- Document Chunk 13379 ---
p_cylinder = brake cylinder pressure (kPa) 

--- Document Chunk 13380 ---
k1 = vehicle dependent constant (set by engineering of ETCS on-board; k1 is normally 

--- Document Chunk 13381 ---
between 2.0 and 2.7) 

--- Document Chunk 13382 ---
p =  500  - p_cylinder / k1 

--- Document Chunk 13383 ---
A.3.10.4 The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algorithm 

--- Document Chunk 13384 ---
to take the service brake feedback into account: 

--- Document Chunk 13385 ---
p = current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in 

--- Document Chunk 13386 ---
A.3.10.3) 

--- Document Chunk 13387 ---
p0 = reference pressure when not braking  

--- Document Chunk 13388 ---
p1 = pressure at which the train starts to brake = p0 - 30  

--- Document Chunk 13389 ---
p2 = pressure limit, under which T_bs1 and T_bs2 are locked = p0 - 60  

--- Document Chunk 13390 ---
p3 = pressure at full service brake = p0 - 150  

--- Document Chunk 13391 ---
Q_feedback_active = a Boolean stating whether the feedback function is active, i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 13392 ---
once it has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the ceiling speed monitoring is 

--- Document Chunk 13393 ---
entered. 

--- Document Chunk 13394 ---
Q_Tbslocked = a boolean stating whether T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to the 

--- Document Chunk 13395 ---
following values due to enough main brake pipe pressure reduction: 

--- Document Chunk 13396 ---
T_bs1_locked =  0 s. 

--- Document Chunk 13397 ---
T_bs2_locked =  2 s. 

--- Document Chunk 13398 ---
Q_displaylocked_P = a boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed is 

--- Document Chunk 13399 ---
locked due to SB feedback. 

--- Document Chunk 13400 ---
Q_displaylocked_SBI = a boolean stating whether the displayed SBI speed (if any) is 

--- Document Chunk 13401 ---
locked due to SB feedback. 

--- Document Chunk 13402 ---
Q_displaylocked_TD = a boolean stating whether the displayed target distance is 

--- Document Chunk 13403 ---
locked due to SB feedback. 

--- Document Chunk 13404 ---
A displayed value is locked from the moment the SB feedback has started to reduce 

--- Document Chunk 13405 ---
T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the calculated value becomes less than the displayed and

A.3.12 Calculation of reduced values of safe brake build up time and 

--- Document Chunk 13624 ---
expected brake build up time 

--- Document Chunk 13625 ---
A.3.12.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 13626 ---
A.3.12.1.1 Modelling the brake build up effort using a ramp function rather than a step function 

--- Document Chunk 13627 ---
allows to predict that a certain deceleration development may be enough to safely reach 

--- Document Chunk 13628 ---
a target with only a portion of the equivalent brake build up time elapsed. 

--- Document Chunk 13629 ---
A.3.12.1.2 This section defines how the safe brake build up time and expected brake build up times 

--- Document Chunk 13630 ---
can be reduced to take profit of such effect. 

--- Document Chunk 13631 ---
A.3.12.1.3 This computation is done for each target according to the following seven steps:  

--- Document Chunk 13632 ---
a) Determination of the inputs for the computation; 

--- Document Chunk 13633 ---
b) Extrapolation of the train speed development over the brake reaction time, to check 

--- Document Chunk 13634 ---
whether this extrapolated speed is above the target speed at this time; 

--- Document Chunk 13635 ---
c) Extrapolation of the train speed development over the full brake build up time along 

--- Document Chunk 13636 ---
the ramp model; 

--- Document Chunk 13637 ---
d) Computation of the time at which the target speed is reached along the ramp model, 

--- Document Chunk 13638 ---
for the targets whose speed is higher than this train speed extrapolated as per bullet 

--- Document Chunk 13639 ---
c); 

--- Document Chunk 13640 ---
e) Computation of the corresponding travelled distances; 

--- Document Chunk 13641 ---
f) Conversion of these travelled distances into reduced values of safe and expected 

--- Document Chunk 13642 ---
(equivalent) brake build up times that are to be used in the formulas to derive the 

--- Document Chunk 13643 ---
EBI/SBI supervision limits; 

--- Document Chunk 13644 ---
g) Selection of the highest reduced values of safe and expected (equivalent) brake build 

--- Document Chunk 13645 ---
up times amongst the ones ensuring equivalent speed reduction and the ones 

--- Document Chunk 13646 ---
ensuring equivalent travelled distance. 

--- Document Chunk 13647 ---
A.3.12.1.4 Exception: in case the conversion model is used and 𝐾𝑡_𝑖𝑛𝑡 =0, the rest of section A.3.12 

--- Document Chunk 13648 ---
does not apply for 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 determination and 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 shall be set to 𝑇𝑏𝑒. 

--- Document Chunk 13649 ---

determination and 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 shall be set to 𝑇𝑏𝑒.

--- Document Chunk 13652 ---

A.3.12.9 Informative annex: derivation of the formulas 

--- Document Chunk 13899 ---
A.3.12.9.1 The purpose of this part is to explain how the formulas given in the rest of section A.3.12 

--- Document Chunk 13900 ---
have been obtained. The explanation is based on the emergency brake related formulas, 

--- Document Chunk 13901 ---
A.3.12.7.17 explains how these can be modified to obtain service brake related formulas. 

--- Document Chunk 13902 ---
A.3.12.9.2 About A.3.12.3&4:  For these calcul ations, it is assumed (refer to figure 45 and 

--- Document Chunk 13903 ---
3.13.9.3.2) that once the emergency brake command is triggered, the train speed 

--- Document Chunk 13904 ---
(compensated for the speed measurement inaccuracy 𝑉𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎0) increases with 𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡1 

--- Document Chunk 13905 ---
acceleration up to 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑚𝑎𝑥 time and then with 𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡2 acceleration. This speed 

--- Document Chunk 13906 ---
increase is compensated by the 𝐴𝐸𝐵 deceleration coming from the brake force as per the 

--- Document Chunk 13907 ---
ramp model from 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡 to 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 (refer to Figure 31). The average deceleration coming 

--- Document Chunk 13908 ---
from the brake force is half of its final (full) value.

A.3.12.9.4 About A.3.12.5: The speed computed at 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 in A.3.12.4 can be computed for any time 

--- Document Chunk 13960 ---
𝑡 between MAX( 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑚𝑎𝑥 , 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡) and 𝑡2𝑏𝑒 by using the following substitution 

--- Document Chunk 13961 ---
𝑡2𝑏𝑒 =𝑡 in A.3.12.9.3 formulas, which give the following final formula: 

--- Document Chunk 13962 ---
𝑣(𝑡)=MAX(0 ,𝑉𝑒𝑠𝑡 +𝑉𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎0+𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡1 ∙𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑚𝑎𝑥 +𝐴𝑒𝑠𝑡2 ∙(𝑡−𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑚𝑎𝑥)

A.3.12.9.5 The above formula can be used to express an unknown time (𝑡−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡) to get the 

--- Document Chunk 13966 ---
final time 𝑡=𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ that corresponds to the wanted final speed (𝑉𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 +

𝑑𝑉𝑒𝑏𝑖(𝑉𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡)). Doing so, this quadratic form from which (𝑡−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡) or 𝑡=𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ

finally, can be obtained by solving:

A.3.12.9.7 The value of 𝐷𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ is the value of 𝑑_𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑝(𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ). It must be noticed that after

lead to obtaining the same travelled distance 𝐷𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ. In contrast to the use of t he

ramp model, a section of the EBD curve is needed here, between this sought time 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛 

--- Document Chunk 14072 ---
and the time the wanted final speed 𝑉𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡, here called 𝑉𝑇) is reached.

A.3.12.9.17 About A.3.12.8:  This value 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛, i.e. 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡, ensures that the distance 

--- Document Chunk 14259 ---
travelled along the step model (supporting section 3.13 formulas) is equivalent to the one 

--- Document Chunk 14260 ---
computed along the ramp model. However, it does not ensure that the speed reduction 

--- Document Chunk 14261 ---
is equivalent along both models. 

--- Document Chunk 14262 ---
A.3.12.9.18 Therefore, an equivalent brake build up time 𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑉 computed from 

--- Document Chunk 14263 ---
𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ is used as a lower limit to the final 𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 value. Its computation is similar 

--- Document Chunk 14264 ---
to the one defined by clause 3.13.2.2.3.2.4: 

--- Document Chunk 14265 ---
𝑡𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ_𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝_𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑉 =𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡 +

𝑡2𝑏𝑒_𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ−𝑇𝑏𝑒_𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡

A.3.12.9.19 About service brake related formulas:  They can be obtained from the emergency

--- Document Chunk 14272 ---

A.3.13 Inhibition of increase of displayed permitted speed and SBI

--- Document Chunk 14276 ---
A.3.13.1 This appendix specifies under which conditions the displayed permitted speed and SBI 

--- Document Chunk 14277 ---
speed are locked in order to avoid their increase which could be caused by active 

--- Document Chunk 14278 ---
reduction of brake build up times (see Appendix A.3.12). 

--- Document Chunk 14279 ---
A.3.13.2 The boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed and SBI speed are not 

--- Document Chunk 14280 ---
allowed to increase (Q_display_pawl) shall be calculated according to the following 

--- Document Chunk 14281 ---

4.4.6 SLEEPING 

--- Document Chunk 14863 ---
4.4.6.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 14864 ---
4.4.6.1.1 The Sleeping mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of a 

--- Document Chunk 14865 ---
slave engine that is remote controlled. 

--- Document Chunk 14866 ---
4.4.6.1.2 The desk(s) of a sleeping engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no information 

--- Document Chunk 14867 ---
shall be shown). 

--- Document Chunk 14868 ---
4.4.6.1.3 As the engine is remote controlled by the leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 14869 ---
equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 14870 ---
4.4.6.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 

--- Document Chunk 14871 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 14872 ---
train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 14873 ---
4.4.6.1.5 Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on-board via the train interface. 

--- Document Chunk 14874 ---
4.4.6.1.6 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping engine. 

--- Document Chunk 14875 ---
The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should therefore try to memorise the occurrence 

--- Document Chunk 14876 ---
of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves the Sleeping mode. 

--- Document Chunk 14877 ---
The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment should also try to send an error information to 

--- Document Chunk 14878 ---
the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 14879 ---
4.4.6.1.7 If a desk of the sleeping engine is opened while the train is running (this is an abnormal 

--- Document Chunk 14880 ---
operation), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand-By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 14881 ---
4.4.6.1.8 If the sleeping input information is set to "sleeping not requested" (no more detection of 

--- Document Chunk 14882 ---
the remote control), the switch to S tand-By mode shall be made only if the train is at 

--- Document Chunk 14883 ---
standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 14884 ---
4.4.6.1.9 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 14885 ---

--- Document Chunk 14888 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 14889 ---
b) In level 2, when entering or exiting Sleeping mode (to report the change of mode to 

--- Document Chunk 14890 ---
the RBC). 

--- Document Chunk 14891 ---
c) In level 2, when a safety critical fault of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment occurs 

--- Document Chunk 14892 ---
(to report the fault to the RBC). 

--- Document Chunk 14893 ---
4.4.6.1.11 Intentionally deleted.

ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 14937 ---
4.4.7.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Standstill Supervision, in order 

--- Document Chunk 14938 ---
to prevent the train from moving. 

--- Document Chunk 14939 ---
4.4.7.1.5.1 As soon as a movement is detected, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall start supervising 

--- Document Chunk 14940 ---
(see section 3.6.7) whether the train travels away, from the location when the movement 

--- Document Chunk 14941 ---
was detected, over a distance longer than a distance specified by the National Value. In 

--- Document Chunk 14942 ---
case this distance is exceeded, the brake command shall be triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 14943 ---
4.4.7.1.5.2 Refer to section 3.14.1 for the revocation of the brake command. 

--- Document Chunk 14944 ---

--- Document Chunk 14985 ---
4.4.8.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 14986 ---
4.4.8.1.1 The purpose of the Shunting mode is to enable shunting movements. In Shunting mode, 

--- Document Chunk 14987 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise the train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 14988 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the shunting mode speed limit  

--- Document Chunk 14989 ---
b) a list of expected balise groups (if such list was sent by the trackside equipment). The 

--- Document Chunk 14990 ---
train shall be tripped if a balise gro up, not contained in the list, is passed (When an 

--- Document Chunk 14991 ---
empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise 

--- Document Chunk 14992 ---
groups can be passed) 

--- Document Chunk 14993 ---
c) “stop if in shunting mode” information. The train is tripped if such information is 

--- Document Chunk 14994 ---
received from balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 14995 ---
d) Intentionally deleted 

--- Document Chunk 14996 ---
4.4.8.1.2 The Shunting mode shall not require Train Data. 

--- Document Chunk 14997 ---
4.4.8.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function ; in 

--- Document Chunk 14998 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine shall be used to refer to train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 14999 ---
4.4.8.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall generate the information  to the train 

--- Document Chunk 15000 ---
interface that it is ready for remote shunting. 

--- Document Chunk 15001 ---
4.4.8.1.5 While the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in Shunting mode, the reception of level transition 

--- Document Chunk 15002 ---
orders has no immediate effec t. The level transition announcements shall be rejected 

--- Document Chunk 15003 ---
and, upon reception of the order while already in Shunting mode , an immediate level 

--- Document Chunk 15004 ---
transition order or a conditional level transition order shall be stored but evaluated only 

--- Document Chunk 15005 ---
when another mode than Shunting or Passive Shunting has been entered (i.e. when the 

--- Document Chunk 15006 ---
Shunting movement is terminated). 

--- Document Chunk 15007 ---
4.4.8.1.5.1 Note: in case the Shunting movement is terminated through a direct transition to No 

--- Document Chunk 15008 ---
Power mode, see clause 4.11.1.4. 

--- Document Chunk 15009 ---
4.4.8.1.5.2 When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 15010 ---
board in Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store 

--- Document Chunk 15011 ---
the RBC contact information. 

--- Document Chunk 15012 ---
4.4.8.1.5.3 When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC-RBC hand-

--- Document Chunk 15013 ---
over, except for storing the RBC contact information given at the RBC/RBC border. 

--- Document Chunk 15014 ---
4.4.8.1.6 Shunting mode can be selected by the driver, only accepted when the train is at standstill, 

--- Document Chunk 15015 ---
or ordered by the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 15016 ---

4.4.11 STAFF RESPONSIBLE 

--- Document Chunk 15145 ---
4.4.11.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 15146 ---
4.4.11.1.1 The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own 

--- Document Chunk 15147 ---
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area. 

--- Document Chunk 15148 ---
4.4.11.1.2 This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example: 

--- Document Chunk 15149 ---
a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment starts-up (awakening of the train). 

--- Document Chunk 15150 ---
b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 15151 ---
c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact). 

--- Document Chunk 15152 ---
4.4.11.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 15153 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit  

--- Document Chunk 15154 ---
b) a given distance (regarding its supervision starting time/start  location see 

--- Document Chunk 15155 ---
4.4.11.1.3.1). The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves 

--- Document Chunk 15156 ---
with a target speed of zero to the end of this distance. If the train overpasses this 

--- Document Chunk 15157 ---
distance (see next note) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trip the train 

--- Document Chunk 15158 ---
c) a list of expected balise groups, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train shall 

--- Document Chunk 15159 ---
be tripped if overpassing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an empty list is 

--- Document Chunk 15160 ---
sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise groups can be 

--- Document Chunk 15161 ---
passed) 

--- Document Chunk 15162 ---
d) balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the train, 

--- Document Chunk 15163 ---
unless the overpassed balise group is included in a list of expected balises as defined 

--- Document Chunk 15164 ---
in item c) 

--- Document Chunk 15165 ---
e) running in the direction opposite to the train orientation ( Unauthorised Direction 

--- Document Chunk 15166 ---
Movement Protection) 

--- Document Chunk 15167 ---
4.4.11.1.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall supervise the SR distance as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 15168 ---
a) If the National/Default Value determines the max permitted distance to run in SR 

--- Document Chunk 15169 ---
mode, the calculation of the remaining  distance from the virtual train position to the 

--- Document Chunk 15170 ---
end of the SR distance (see section 3.6.7) shall be based on a supervisio n starting 

--- Document Chunk 15171 ---
when SR mode is entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode, when Override is 

--- Document Chunk 15172 ---
activated. 

--- Document Chunk 15173 ---
b) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 15174 ---
by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the calculation of the remaining distance from 

--- Document Chunk 15175 ---
the virtual train position to the end of the SR distance (see section 3.6.7) shall be 

--- Document Chunk 15176 ---
based on a supervision starting when the distance information is received or entered. 

--- Document Chunk 15177 ---
c) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 15178 ---
by Euroloop, the distance information transmitted by Euroloop shall be referred to one 

--- Document Chunk 15179 ---
or more reference balise groups. On -board shall evaluate the distance to run in SR 

--- Document Chunk 15180 ---
mode by matching the reference balise groups given with the LRBG.

distance. 

--- Document Chunk 15198 ---
4.4.11.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify

--- Document Chunk 15200 ---
only at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 15201 ---
4.4.11.1.5.1 If a train movement is detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance

an MA request. 

--- Document Chunk 15208 ---
4.4.11.1.6.1 Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further. 

--- Document Chunk 15209 ---
4.4.11.1.6.2 When entering SR mode, the value applicable for SR mode speed limit and the value 

--- Document Chunk 15210 ---
applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default values. Exception 

--- Document Chunk 15211 ---
for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance. 

--- Document Chunk 15212 ---
4.4.11.1.6.3 While in SR mode , the value applicable for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if 

--- Document Chunk 15213 ---
available, the last value entered by the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 15214 ---
4.4.11.1.6.4 While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available, the 

--- Document Chunk 15215 ---
last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 15216 ---
a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver; 

--- Document Chunk 15217 ---
b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 15218 ---
4.4.11.1.6.5 When "Override" is selected , the SR mode speed limit value and the SR distance 

--- Document Chunk 15219 ---
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The 

--- Document Chunk 15220 ---
corresponding National/Default values shall enter in force. 

--- Document Chunk 15221 ---

--- Document Chunk 15311 ---
4.4.13.1.1.1 Note: Application of emergency brakes and tr ain trip are two different things. For 

--- Document Chunk 15312 ---
example, exceeding the permitted speed leads to application of the emergency brakes, 

--- Document Chunk 15313 ---
but as long as the train does not pass the EOA/LOA, it is not a train trip. 

--- Document Chunk 15314 ---
4.4.13.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall command the emergency brakes (no brake

4.4.15 NON LEADING 

--- Document Chunk 15401 ---
4.4.15.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 15402 ---
4.4.15.1.1 The Non-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of 

--- Document Chunk 15403 ---
a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not remote 

--- Document Chunk 15404 ---
controlled) but has its own driver. 

--- Document Chunk 15405 ---
4.4.15.1.1.1 Note: This operating situation is called Tandem. 

--- Document Chunk 15406 ---
4.4.15.1.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to enter 

--- Document Chunk 15407 ---
in Non-Leading mode, a non-leading input information from the train interface. 

--- Document Chunk 15408 ---
4.4.15.1.1.3 Upon the detection that the non-leading input information is set to "Non-leading not 

--- Document Chunk 15409 ---
permitted", the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver that the non -

--- Document Chunk 15410 ---
leading operation is no longer permitted and shall request an acknowledgement from the 

--- Document Chunk 15411 ---
driver. However, the switch to Stand -By mode shall be made only if the train is at 

--- Document Chunk 15412 ---
standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 15413 ---
4.4.15.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not perform any train movement 

--- Document Chunk 15414 ---
supervision in Non-Leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 15415 ---
4.4.15.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 

--- Document Chunk 15416 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 15417 ---
train front/rear end  and no train integrity information shall be reported to the RBC, 

--- Document Chunk 15418 ---
regardless of whether the train integrity and/or the safe con sist length information is 

--- Document Chunk 15419 ---
available on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 15420 ---
4.4.15.1.4 When level is 2, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall report its position to the 

--- Document Chunk 15421 ---
RBC, according to the previously received parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 15422 ---
4.4.15.1.5 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fau lt in a non -leading 

--- Document Chunk 15423 ---
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the 

--- Document Chunk 15424 ---
occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves Non 

--- Document Chunk 15425 ---

--- Document Chunk 15461 ---
4.4.16.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 15462 ---
4.4.16.1.1  If it is interfaced to an ERTMS/ATO on-board and if the ATO selector is in position "On", 

--- Document Chunk 15463 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in Automatic Driving mode when the 

--- Document Chunk 15464 ---
ERTMS/ATO on-board drives the train according to a journey profile provided by the 

--- Document Chunk 15465 ---
ERTMS/ATO trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 15466 ---
4.4.16.1.2  The Automatic Driving mode can only be entered upon a driver action, i.e. selecting "ATO 

--- Document Chunk 15467 ---
engage" when all necessary conditions are fulfilled (see SUBSET-125 for details). 

--- Document Chunk 15468 ---
4.4.16.1.3  Once in Automatic Driving mode, the driver can at any time take back the control of the 

--- Document Chunk 15469 ---
train driving by acting on the brakes or by selecting "ATO disengage". 

--- Document Chunk 15470 ---
4.4.16.1.4  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements in the same 

--- Document Chunk 15471 ---
way as in Full Supervision mode, except that for the speed and distance target speed 

--- Document Chunk 15472 ---
monitoring when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded neither a brake command nor the 

--- Document Chunk 15473 ---
intervention status shall be triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 15474 ---
4.4.16.1.5  The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 

--- Document Chunk 15475 ---
speed and the SBI speed (whenever the ERTMS/ATO on -board drives over the 

--- Document Chunk 15476 ---
permitted speed) to the driver (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter  4.7 “DMI 

--- Document Chunk 15477 ---
depending on modes”). 

--- Document Chunk 15478 ---
4.4.16.1.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall generate the information to the train 

--- Document Chunk 15479 ---

--- Document Chunk 15484 ---
except for the following situation: the ERTMS/ATO on-board is responsible for respecting 

--- Document Chunk 15485 ---
the EOA when approaching an EOA with a release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 15486 ---
4.4.16.3.2  Substituting the driver for acting on the traction/brakes of the train, the ERTMS/ATO on-

--- Document Chunk 15487 ---
board is responsible to drive the train according to the ATO journey profile. However 

--- Document Chunk 15488 ---
each time  the "ATO ready"  information is displayed to the driver  (e.g. af ter the

4.4.18 REVERSING 

--- Document Chunk 15540 ---
4.4.18.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 15541 ---
4.4.18.1.1 The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train 

--- Document Chunk 15542 ---
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This is 

--- Document Chunk 15543 ---
possible only in areas so marked by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 15544 ---
4.4.18.1.2 Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to 

--- Document Chunk 15545 ---
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location. 

--- Document Chunk 15546 ---
4.4.18.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 15547 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 15548 ---
b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation, given from trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 15549 ---
The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance 

--- Document Chunk 15550 ---
4.4.18.1.4 After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing distance, 

--- Document Chunk 15551 ---
and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 15552 ---
equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the 

--- Document Chunk 15553 ---
direction opposite to the train orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 15554 ---
4.4.18.1.5 The ERTMS/ETC S on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 

--- Document Chunk 15555 ---
speed and the remaining distance to run. 

--- Document Chunk 15556 ---
4.4.18.1.6 In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3  table 5, triggering 

--- Document Chunk 15557 ---
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall command the emergency 

--- Document Chunk 15558 ---
brake instead of the service brake . For the revocation of the brake command, refer to 

--- Document Chunk 15559 ---
3.13.10.2.4. 

--- Document Chunk 15560 ---
4.4.18.1.7 The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the driving 

--- Document Chunk 15561 ---
cab (as before reversing). 

--- Document Chunk 15562 ---
4.4.18.1.8 The ERTMS/ETCS onboard e quipment shall perform the Unauthorised Direction  

--- Document Chunk 15563 ---
Movement Protection. As in RV mode, the allowed movement is a reverse movement, 

--- Document Chunk 15564 ---

4.4.19 LIMITED SUPERVISION 

--- Document Chunk 15600 ---
4.4.19.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 15601 ---
4.4.19.1.1 The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas where trackside 

--- Document Chunk 15602 ---
information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 15603 ---
4.4.19.1.2 Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered automatically 

--- Document Chunk 15604 ---
when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 15605 ---
4.4.19.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against a 

--- Document Chunk 15606 ---
dynamic speed profile. 

--- Document Chunk 15607 ---
4.4.19.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed  and the release 

--- Document Chunk 15608 ---
speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4.7 “DMI depending on modes”). 

--- Document Chunk 15609 ---
Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the generic LS 

--- Document Chunk 15610 ---
function marker is stored on-board or if the conditions in clause 4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, 

--- Document Chunk 15611 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall also display the lowest speed amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 15612 ---
a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the 

--- Document Chunk 15613 ---
EOA/LOA, AND 

--- Document Chunk 15614 ---
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA 

--- Document Chunk 15615 ---
4.4.19.1.4.1 The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised Speed 

--- Document Chunk 15616 ---
within the Movement Authority (LSSMA) 

--- Document Chunk 15617 ---
4.4.19.1.4.2 Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 15618 ---
equipment shall start a delay timer: 

--- Document Chunk 15619 ---
a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the me ssage 

--- Document Chunk 15620 ---
including the order. 

--- Document Chunk 15621 ---
b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first encountered 

--- Document Chunk 15622 ---
balise of the balise group giving the order. 

--- Document Chunk 15623 ---
c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer (see 

--- Document Chunk 15624 ---
section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed. 

--- Document Chunk 15625 ---
4.4.19.1.4.3 When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 15626 ---
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the LSSMA. 

--- Document Chunk 15627 ---
4.4.19.1.4.4 On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the L SSMA display, a toggle on order 

--- Document Chunk 15628 ---
which has not been executed yet (because the on-board delay timer has not reached the 

--- Document Chunk 15629 ---
delay time-out value) shall be deleted by the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 15630 ---
4.4.19.1.4.5 If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 15631 ---
shall toggle off the LSSMA display in case: 

--- Document Chunk 15632 ---
a) the clause 4.4.19.1.4.3 is not immediately fulfilled upon reception of a new order to 

--- Document Chunk 15633 ---
toggle on the LSSMA display 

--- Document Chunk 15634 ---
b) an order to toggle off the LSSMA display is received.

4.4.20 PASSIVE SHUNTING 

--- Document Chunk 15686 ---
4.4.20.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 15687 ---
4.4.20.1.1 The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 15688 ---
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the 

--- Document Chunk 15689 ---
leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry 

--- Document Chunk 15690 ---
on a shunting movement wit h a s ingle engine fitted with one on -board equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 15691 ---
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab. 

--- Document Chunk 15692 ---
4.4.20.1.2 The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no 

--- Document Chunk 15693 ---
information shall be shown). 

--- Document Chunk 15694 ---
4.4.20.1.3 As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15695 ---
not perform any train movement supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 15696 ---
4.4.20.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform Train Position function; in 

--- Document Chunk 15697 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used  to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 15698 ---
train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 15699 ---
4.4.20.1.5 It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; 

--- Document Chunk 15700 ---
while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function 

--- Document Chunk 15701 ---
“Continue Shunting on desk closure”. 

--- Document Chunk 15702 ---
4.4.20.1.6 When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 

--- Document Chunk 15703 ---
Passive Shunting mode if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active and 

--- Document Chunk 15704 ---
the passive shunting input information is set to "Passive shunting permitted" on the train 

--- Document Chunk 15705 ---
interface. If the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the passive 

--- Document Chunk 15706 ---
shunting input information is set to "Passive shunting not permitted", the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 15707 ---
on-board equipment shall switch to Stand-By mode instead. 

--- Document Chunk 15708 ---
4.4.20.1.7 The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” shall allow one and only one 

--- Document Chunk 15709 ---
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be 

--- Document Chunk 15710 ---
inactive once the Shunting mode is left. 

--- Document Chunk 15711 ---
4.4.20.1.8 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened  and no “Stop Shunting on desk 

--- Document Chunk 15712 ---
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard , the 

--- Document Chunk 15713 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 15714 ---
4.4.20.1.9 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Stop Shunting on desk opening” 

--- Document Chunk 15715 ---
information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 15716 ---
on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 15717 ---
4.4.20.1.10 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive 

--- Document Chunk 15718 ---
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sh ould therefore try to 

--- Document Chunk 15719 ---
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine 

--- Document Chunk 15720 ---
leaves the Passive Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 15721 ---
4.4.20.1.11 While the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in Passive Shunting mode, the reception of level 

--- Document Chunk 15722 ---

4.4.21 SUPERVISED MANOEUVRE 

--- Document Chunk 15765 ---
4.4.21.1  Description 

--- Document Chunk 15766 ---
4.4.21.1.1 The purpose of the Supervised Manoeuvre mode is to enable an enhanced supervision 

--- Document Chunk 15767 ---
of shunting movements similar to the Full Supervision mode, while the cab is not 

--- Document Chunk 15768 ---
necessarily at the front of the shunting consist. 

--- Document Chunk 15769 ---
4.4.21.1.2 The Supervised Manoeuvre mode can only be entered upon the reception of an 

--- Document Chunk 15770 ---
authorisation from the RBC, which is preceded by a driver action (i.e. at standstill 

--- Document Chunk 15771 ---
selecting "Supervised Manoeuvre"). 

--- Document Chunk 15772 ---
4.4.21.1.3 The selection of "Supervised Manoeuvre" by the driver shall only be possible if the “safe 

--- Document Chunk 15773 ---
consist length” information is available on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 15774 ---
4.4.21.1.4 However, the Supervised Manoeuvre mode does not require that the Train Data set as 

--- Document Chunk 15775 ---
listed in 3.18.3.2, which would fully correspond to the composition of the shunting consist, 

--- Document Chunk 15776 ---
is captured by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. With the exception of 3.18.3.2 b), 

--- Document Chunk 15777 ---
preconfigured default Train Data shall be used by the on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 15778 ---
4.4.21.1.5 To be in Supervised Manoeuvre mode, SSP and gradient are not required for the whole 

--- Document Chunk 15779 ---
length of the consist, but shall be at least available from the front end of the consist. 

--- Document Chunk 15780 ---
4.4.21.1.6 Once in Supervised Manoeuvre mode, if SSP and gradient are not known for the whole 

--- Document Chunk 15781 ---
length of the consist, an indication “EN TERING SM” shall be clearly displayed to the 

--- Document Chunk 15782 ---
driver until SSP and gradient are known for the whole length of the consist. 

--- Document Chunk 15783 ---
4.4.21.1.6.1 Note: this indication may also be displayed in case the safe consist length information 

--- Document Chunk 15784 ---
has been changed. 

--- Document Chunk 15785 ---
4.4.21.1.7  The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function, taking 

--- Document Chunk 15786 ---
into account the clauses 3.6.1.3.4, 3.6.1.5.1, 3.6.4.1.5, 3.18.3.2.4 and the Train Data 

--- Document Chunk 15787 ---
“safe consist length”. In case, upon reception of a Supervised Manoeuvre authorisation, 

--- Document Chunk 15788 ---
the direction of its Movement Authority is opposite to the current train orientation, the 

--- Document Chunk 15789 ---
following shall apply: 

--- Document Chunk 15790 ---
a) The new estimated train front end shall be obtained by shifting the current one in  

--- Document Chunk 15791 ---
direction of the new authorisation, with a distance equal to the sum of the nominal 

--- Document Chunk 15792 ---
consist lengths in front of and in rear of the engine respectively. 

--- Document Chunk 15793 ---
b) The new min safe front end shall be obtained by shifting the current max safe front 

--- Document Chunk 15794 ---
end in direction of the new authorisation, with a distance equal to the sum of: 

--- Document Chunk 15795 ---
• the max safe consist length in front of the engine and the min safe consist length 

--- Document Chunk 15796 ---
in rear of the engine, if the train orientation was the same as the active cab, or 

--- Document Chunk 15797 ---
• the max safe consist length in rear of the engine and the min safe consist length 

--- Document Chunk 15798 ---
in front of the engine, if the train orientation was opposite to the active cab. 

--- Document Chunk 15799 ---
c) The new max safe fro nt end shall be obtained by shifting the current min safe front

4.5 Modes and on-board functions 

--- Document Chunk 15873 ---
4.5.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 15874 ---
4.5.1.1 The following table specifies for each mode, which on-board functions are active or not, 

--- Document Chunk 15875 ---
when it cannot be derived from the specific provisions of the mode itself (see § 4.4), from 

--- Document Chunk 15876 ---
the mode transitions (see § 4.6), from the display of information according to the mode 

--- Document Chunk 15877 ---
(see §4.7), from the acceptance criteria of trackside information according to the level 

--- Document Chunk 15878 ---
and mode (see §4.8), from the handling of accepted and stored information upon a mode 

--- Document Chunk 15879 ---
transition (see §4.10 and 4.11) and from any other explicit mode specific provision in the 

--- Document Chunk 15880 ---
specifications. The term “function” in this section must be understood a s an individual 

--- Document Chunk 15881 ---
clause classified as on -board requirement or definition, or as a group of clauses 

--- Document Chunk 15882 ---
classified as on-board requirement or definition, which is/are referred to in the “Related 

--- Document Chunk 15883 ---
SRS §” (second column of the table). 

--- Document Chunk 15884 ---
4.5.1.2 Note: This table must be understood as a complement to all other SRS chapters.  

--- Document Chunk 15885 ---
Conversely when a clause is not referred to in this table, it means that there are no 

--- Document Chunk 15886 ---
additional requirements on the applicability of the clause depending on the mode to the 

--- Document Chunk 15887 ---
ones, if any, that can be found in the rest of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 15888 ---
4.5.1.3 Note: for DMI depending on modes, refer to §4.7. 

--- Document Chunk 15889 ---
4.5.1.4 Unless stated otherwise, the clauses not referred to in this table shall not be applicable 

--- Document Chunk 15890 ---
in NP mode. 

--- Document Chunk 15891 ---
4.5.1.5 With the exception of the clauses stipulated in the sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.5 respectively, 

--- Document Chunk 15892 ---
the applicability of any other clause of the SRS is irrelevant in modes IS and SF. 

--- Document Chunk 15893 ---
4.5.2 Active Functions Table 

--- Document Chunk 15894 ---
4.5.2.1 X = functions shall be active, i.e. their corresponding on-board requirements and/or 

--- Document Chunk 15895 ---
definitions shall apply 

--- Document Chunk 15896 ---
Empty case = functions shall be inactive, i.e. their corresponding on-board 

--- Document Chunk 15897 ---
requirements and/or definitions shall not apply 

--- Document Chunk 15898 ---
NR = Not Relevant: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 15899 ---
behaviour cannot be harmonised 

--- Document Chunk 15900 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 15901 ---
4.5.2.2 Whenever a section number is referred to in the second column of the table, it means 

--- Document Chunk 15902 ---
that all the clauses classified as on -board requirement belonging to thi s section are 

--- Document Chunk 15903 ---
applicable/not applicable for the concerned mode, depending whether the corresponding 

--- Document Chunk 15904 ---
function is marked as active/not active.

4.6 Transitions between modes 

--- Document Chunk 16329 ---
4.6.1 Symbols 

--- Document Chunk 16330 ---
4.6.1.1 The indication “4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition 

--- Document Chunk 16331 ---
4.6.1.2 From the mode located in the column 

--- Document Chunk 16332 ---
4.6.1.3 To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “>”. 

--- Document Chunk 16333 ---
4.6.1.4 Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “-px-”, x is the 

--- Document Chunk 16334 ---
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at the 

--- Document Chunk 16335 ---
same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2. 

--- Document Chunk 16336 ---
4.6.1.5 Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it 

--- Document Chunk 16337 ---
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead 

--- Document Chunk 16338 ---
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for FS 

--- Document Chunk 16339 ---
and a MA for OS to a given engine,  this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and the 

--- Document Chunk 16340 ---
transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order). 

--- Document Chunk 16341 ---
4.6.1.6 "16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

4.7 DMI depending on modes 

--- Document Chunk 17053 ---
4.7.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 17054 ---
4.7.1.1 The DMI is an interface that allows the direct exchange of information between the driver 

--- Document Chunk 17055 ---
and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information done 

--- Document Chunk 17056 ---
via the train interface (e.g. a driver’s action on the service brake used for the service 

--- Document Chunk 17057 ---
brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 17058 ---
4.7.1.2 The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETC S onboard equipment powered/unpowered” 

--- Document Chunk 17059 ---
is (are) not part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 17060 ---
4.7.1.3 The device(s) used to select /indicate “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not 

--- Document Chunk 17061 ---
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 17062 ---
4.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 17063 ---
4.7.1.5 Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by the 

--- Document Chunk 17064 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board is not included in the following section. 

--- Document Chunk 17065 ---
4.7.2 DMI versus Mode Table 

--- Document Chunk 17066 ---
4.7.2.1.1 X = active: For a  DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to 

--- Document Chunk 17067 ---
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equ ipment is in the mode indicated in the 

--- Document Chunk 17068 ---
column. For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this 

--- Document Chunk 17069 ---
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 

--- Document Chunk 17070 ---
column). 

--- Document Chunk 17071 ---
4.7.2.1.2 A = available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another 

--- Document Chunk 17072 ---
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here. 

--- Document Chunk 17073 ---
4.7.2.1.3 Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system. 

--- Document Chunk 17074 ---
4.7.2.1.4 NA = Not Applicable: This concer ns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and 

--- Document Chunk 17075 ---
outputs cannot be determined.

4.8 Acceptance of received information 

--- Document Chunk 17541 ---
4.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 17542 ---
4.8.1.1 The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of which information is accepted or rejected 

--- Document Chunk 17543 ---
depending on the state of the on -board (level, mode) , the origin of the received 

--- Document Chunk 17544 ---
information (from RBC or not), and in case of information not transmitted by an RBC the 

--- Document Chunk 17545 ---
type of information (infill or non-infill). 

--- Document Chunk 17546 ---
4.8.1.2 The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 

--- Document Chunk 17547 ---
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the level, 

--- Document Chunk 17548 ---
the origin and the type of information ”, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted 

--- Document Chunk 17549 ---
information depending on the mode and the type of information”. 

--- Document Chunk 17550 ---
4.8.1.3 If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that message 

--- Document Chunk 17551 ---
shall be evaluated considering the level transition information. 

--- Document Chunk 17552 ---
4.8.1.3.1 Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a 

--- Document Chunk 17553 ---
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated against 

--- Document Chunk 17554 ---
the first filter in two steps: 

--- Document Chunk 17555 ---
1) A first evaluation shall take place considering the on-board currently operated level, 

--- Document Chunk 17556 ---
as if a level transition order for further location had been received (i.e. the condition 

--- Document Chunk 17557 ---
[1] or [2] of Figure 3, if applied, shall be automatically fulfilled). 

--- Document Chunk 17558 ---
2) Then, if relevant, information to which the condition [1] or [2] of Figure 3 applies shall 

--- Document Chunk 17559 ---
be immediately extracted from the buffer and re -evaluated according to the new 

--- Document Chunk 17560 ---
selected level. The information accepted or rejected immediately considering the on-

--- Document Chunk 17561 ---
board currently operated level shall not be re-evaluated according to the new selected 

--- Document Chunk 17562 ---
level. 

--- Document Chunk 17563 ---
4.8.1.4 Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change 

--- Document Chunk 17564 ---
of level, is re -checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that, 

--- Document Chunk 17565 ---
when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment – still unchanged, until the 

--- Document Chunk 17566 ---
stored information has been processed. The consequence for the Third Filter is that 

--- Document Chunk 17567 ---
information needs to be ac cepted for this short period also in modes in which this 

--- Document Chunk 17568 ---
information is otherwise useless. 

--- Document Chunk 17569 ---
4.8.1.5 If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all other 

--- Document Chunk 17570 ---
non-infill information in that message. 

--- Document Chunk 17571 ---
4.8.1.6 When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of 

--- Document Chunk 17572 ---
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be 

--- Document Chunk 17573 ---
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

4.8.2 Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 17663 ---
4.8.2.1 The following tables shall be applied assuming that: 

--- Document Chunk 17664 ---
ERA * UNISIG * EEIG ERTMS USERS GROUP 

--- Document Chunk 17665 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 17666 ---
SUBSET-026-4

System Requirements Specification 

--- Document Chunk 17670 ---
Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 17671 ---
Page 62/93 

--- Document Chunk 17672 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 17673 ---
a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and with 

--- Document Chunk 17674 ---
the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16) 

--- Document Chunk 17675 ---
b) with the exception of information part of an SM authorisation, the direction for which 

--- Document Chunk 17676 ---
the information is valid matches the current train orientation, or  the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 17677 ---
crossing direction (for SL, PS and SH engines).(see section 3.6.3) 

--- Document Chunk 17678 ---
c) In level 2, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A” (Accepted) 

--- Document Chunk 17679 ---
comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this information is 

--- Document Chunk 17680 ---
received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is still responsible, 

--- Document Chunk 17681 ---
it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed 

--- Document Chunk 17682 ---
Exception 1: The information “Acknowledgement of Train Data”, "Session 

--- Document Chunk 17683 ---
Management" and “Acknowledgement of Session Termination" shall be immediately 

--- Document Chunk 17684 ---
accepted. 

--- Document Chunk 17685 ---
Exception 2: The information “RBC transition order”, “Request to shorten  MA”, 

--- Document Chunk 17686 ---
“Revocation of Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be 

--- Document Chunk 17687 ---
rejected. 

--- Document Chunk 17688 ---
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the SOLR (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 17689 ---
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3). 

--- Document Chunk 17690 ---
e) the information from balise is received while no movement opposite to the authorised 

--- Document Chunk 17691 ---
direction is performed (see clause 3.14.3.6) 

--- Document Chunk 17692 ---
4.8.2.2 Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be decoded, 

--- Document Chunk 17693 ---
the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” is only used by 

--- Document Chunk 17694 ---
the o n-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 17695 ---
message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly read, the 

--- Document Chunk 17696 ---
information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”, if received, shall 

--- Document Chunk 17697 ---
be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need not to be referred 

--- Document Chunk 17698 ---
to in the following tables. 

--- Document Chunk 17699 ---
4.8.2.3 In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region 

--- Document Chunk 17700 ---
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any 

--- Document Chunk 17701 ---
further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9. 3 b) ). 

--- Document Chunk 17702 ---
Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group message, 

--- Document Chunk 17703 ---
shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and need not to be 

--- Document Chunk 17704 ---
referred to in the following tables. 

--- Document Chunk 17705 ---
4.8.2.4 Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the 

--- Document Chunk 17706 ---
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET -035), what will happen to the data to be used 

--- Document Chunk 17707 ---
by applications outs ide ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an 

--- Document Chunk 17708 ---
external application, processed by a national function…) is outside the scope of this 

--- Document Chunk 17709 ---
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 17710 ---
functionality. 

--- Document Chunk 17711 ---
4.8.2.5 Note: the system version order received from balise group need not be referred to in the 

--- Document Chunk 17712 ---
following tables because it is taken into account by the on -board equipment prior to the 

--- Document Chunk 17713 ---
checks referred to in this section (see also clause 3.17.3.3).

4.8.5 Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or 

--- Document Chunk 18466 ---
RBC/RBC handover 

--- Document Chunk 18467 ---
4.8.5.1 If an order to switch to level NTC, 1 or 2 at a further location has been received, the 

--- Document Chunk 18468 ---
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see figure 

--- Document Chunk 18469 ---
3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages. 

--- Document Chunk 18470 ---
4.8.5.2 If a n RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the 

--- Document Chunk 18471 ---
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a 

--- Document Chunk 18472 ---
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from three 

--- Document Chunk 18473 ---
filtered messages from the Accepting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18474 ---
4.8.5.2.1 Note: the term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the 

--- Document Chunk 18475 ---
transition buffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immedia tely) 

--- Document Chunk 18476 ---
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or according 

--- Document Chunk 18477 ---
to 4.8.2.1c (for RBC/RBC handover). 

--- Document Chunk 18478 ---
4.8.5.3 In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set 

--- Document Chunk 18479 ---
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored. 

--- Document Chunk 18480 ---
4.8.5.4 The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted: 

--- Document Chunk 18481 ---
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition 

--- Document Chunk 18482 ---
order for a different level, OR 

--- Document Chunk 18483 ---
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to 

--- Document Chunk 18484 ---
another Accepting RBC, OR 

--- Document Chunk 18485 ---
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored information 

--- Document Chunk 18486 ---
is terminated 

--- Document Chunk 18487 ---
4.8.5.5 At the same time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18488 ---
becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall 

--- Document Chunk 18489 ---
be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received. 

--- Document Chunk 18490 ---
4.8.5.6 This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to any 

--- Document Chunk 18491 ---
use by the on -board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change of 

--- Document Chunk 18492 ---
mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the following 

--- Document Chunk 18493 ---
principles: 

--- Document Chunk 18494 ---
a) Starting from the information currently used by on-board at the moment the level/RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18495 ---
transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall determine the new 

--- Document Chunk 18496 ---
information for train supervision, by performing sequential updates from the 

--- Document Chunk 18497 ---
information released from the transition buffer, if accepted. 

--- Document Chunk 18498 ---
b) For each information update related to a re -evaluated set of information, the same 

--- Document Chunk 18499 ---
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted outside 

--- Document Chunk 18500 ---
a level/RBC transition context. 

--- Document Chunk 18501 ---
c) The information resulting from this sequential u pdate shall then be used by the 

--- Document Chunk 18502 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.

4.8.5.7 Accepting re-evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 4.8.3 

--- Document Chunk 18513 ---
implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be accepted or 

--- Document Chunk 18514 ---
rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given stop location. This 

--- Document Chunk 18515 ---
decision, based on the comparison between the min safe front end position of the train 

--- Document Chunk 18516 ---
at the time the message was received and the given stop location, shall be  considered 

--- Document Chunk 18517 ---
part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re-evaluation of information stored 

--- Document Chunk 18518 ---
in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4). 

--- Document Chunk 18519 ---
4.8.5.7.1 Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the 

--- Document Chunk 18520 ---
information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see clause 

--- Document Chunk 18521 ---
3.10.2.3) when re-evaluation of the transition buffer is completed. Information accepted 

--- Document Chunk 18522 ---
during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be affected on 

--- Document Chunk 18523 ---
transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10. 

--- Document Chunk 18524 ---
4.8.5.8 Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to 

--- Document Chunk 18525 ---
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted 

--- Document Chunk 18526 ---
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has passed 

--- Document Chunk 18527 ---
the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only) , applies to the time when the 

--- Document Chunk 18528 ---
information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed.  

--- Document Chunk 18529 ---
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any other 

--- Document Chunk 18530 ---
information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

--- Document Chunk 18542 ---
4.9.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 18543 ---
4.9.1.1 Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a level 

--- Document Chunk 18544 ---
transition. 

--- Document Chunk 18545 ---
4.9.1.2 A level transition acts on the “status” of stored information. 

--- Document Chunk 18546 ---
4.9.1.3 In case of entering level 1, MA Request Parameters, Position Report Parameters and 

--- Document Chunk 18547 ---
Track Ahead Free Request shall be deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 18548 ---
4.9.1.3.1 In case of entering level 0, NTC or 1, the information “Inhibition of revocable TSRs from 

--- Document Chunk 18549 ---
balises in level 2” shall be deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 18550 ---
4.9.1.4 For all other stored data, a level transition has no effect (void).

4.10 What happens to accepted and stored information when entering a given mode 

--- Document Chunk 18561 ---
4.10.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 18562 ---
4.10.1.1 Every data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced by a mode transition. 

--- Document Chunk 18563 ---
4.10.1.2 A mode transition acts on the “status” of stored information. 

--- Document Chunk 18564 ---
4.10.1.3 Depending on which mode is entered, the action shall be one of the following: 

--- Document Chunk 18565 ---
a) data is deleted, 

--- Document Chunk 18566 ---
b) data is to be revalidated, 

--- Document Chunk 18567 ---
c) data is reset (set to default values) 

--- Document Chunk 18568 ---
d) data status is unchanged, 

--- Document Chunk 18569 ---
e) not relevant (the action on the data cannot be determined. This concerns the entry in SF and IS modes) 

--- Document Chunk 18570 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 18571 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 18572 ---
D = Deleted TBR = To Be Revalidated U = Unchanged NR = Not relevant R = Reset

4.12 What happens to an ongoing brake command when entering a 

--- Document Chunk 18938 ---
given mode 

--- Document Chunk 18939 ---
4.12.1.1 The reason for which a brake command has been triggered in a given mode may be 

--- Document Chunk 18940 ---
influenced by a mode transition. 

--- Document Chunk 18941 ---
4.12.1.2 Depending on which mode is entered, the action shall be one of the following: 

--- Document Chunk 18942 ---
a) the brake command reason is revoked, i.e.  it does not apply anymore in the context 

--- Document Chunk 18943 ---
of the entered mode 

--- Document Chunk 18944 ---
b) the brake command reason is maintained, i.e. it remains applicable in the context of 

--- Document Chunk 18945 ---
the entered mode 

--- Document Chunk 18946 ---
c) the brake command reason is to be re -evaluated according to the data available in 

--- Document Chunk 18947 ---
the entered mode 

--- Document Chunk 18948 ---
d) not relevant (there is no transition from the mode in which the brake command reason 

--- Document Chunk 18949 ---
could be applicable to the entered mode or the transition condition(s) to the entered 

--- Document Chunk 18950 ---
mode can only be fulfilled when the condition(s) to release the brake command 

--- Document Chunk 18951 ---
associated to this individual reason (see 3.14.1) is(are) fulfilled) 

--- Document Chunk 18952 ---
e) not defined (the action on the brake command reason cannot be determined. This 

--- Document Chunk 18953 ---
concerns the entry in SF and IS modes)

5.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 19535 ---
 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 19536 ---
5.3.1.1 This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the 

--- Document Chunk 19537 ---
scope of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 19538 ---
5.3.1.2 Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and , where convenient, 

--- Document Chunk 19539 ---
is illustrated by a flowchart. 

--- Document Chunk 19540 ---
5.3.1.3 In case the condition(s) in chap ter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this 

--- Document Chunk 19541 ---
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 19542 ---
5.3.1.3.1 Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exiting a procedure immediately (e. g. cut off 

--- Document Chunk 19543 ---
power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment). 

--- Document Chunk 19544 ---
5.3.1.4 National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be 

--- Document Chunk 19545 ---
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is 

--- Document Chunk 19546 ---
retained. 

--- Document Chunk 19547 ---
 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 19548 ---
5.3.2.1 Procedures 

--- Document Chunk 19549 ---
A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and 

--- Document Chunk 19550 ---
components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events 

--- Document Chunk 19551 ---
(triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the required

change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities. 

--- Document Chunk 19553 ---
5.3.2.2 Entities 

--- Document Chunk 19554 ---
The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the entities 

--- Document Chunk 19555 ---
that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on -board equipment, the 

--- Document Chunk 19556 ---
trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 19557 ---
5.3.2.3 States 

--- Document Chunk 19558 ---
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and 

--- Document Chunk 19559 ---
a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains active as 

--- Document Chunk 19560 ---
long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a suc ceeding state are not completely 

--- Document Chunk 19561 ---
satisfied.  

--- Document Chunk 19562 ---
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 19563 ---
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another 

--- Document Chunk 19564 ---
one. Possession of information (e. g.  location information) or not does not force 

--- Document Chunk 19565 ---
branching in states. 

--- Document Chunk 19566 ---
5.3.2.4 Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 19567 ---
Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is triggered 

--- Document Chunk 19568 ---
by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time.

5.4 Procedure Start of mission 

--- Document Chunk 19592 ---
 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 19593 ---
5.4.1.1 The driver may have to start a mission: 

--- Document Chunk 19594 ---
a) Once the train is awake, OR 

--- Document Chunk 19595 ---
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR 

--- Document Chunk 19596 ---
c) Once a mission is ended, OR 

--- Document Chunk 19597 ---
d) Once a desk is opened (e.g. when a slave engine becomes a leading engine). 

--- Document Chunk 19598 ---
5.4.1.2 The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is in Stand-

--- Document Chunk 19599 ---
By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be already stored 

--- Document Chunk 19600 ---
on-board, depending on the previous situation. 

--- Document Chunk 19601 ---
5.4.1.3 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission 

--- Document Chunk 19602 ---
is not the only possibility, the engine may be come remote controlled (i.e. the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 19603 ---
switches to Sleeping mode). 

--- Document Chunk 19604 ---
5.4.1.4 If, upon desk opening, there is an already established communication session for which 

--- Document Chunk 19605 ---
no termination is ongoing, th e ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first terminate 

--- Document Chunk 19606 ---
this communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 19607 ---
 Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 19608 ---
5.4.2.1 At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of 

--- Document Chunk 19609 ---
three states:  

--- Document Chunk 19610 ---
a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct) 

--- Document Chunk 19611 ---
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong) 

--- Document Chunk 19612 ---
c) “Unknown” (no stored value available) 

--- Document Chunk 19613 ---
5.4.2.2 This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC contact information, 

--- Document Chunk 19614 ---
Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3). 

--- Document Chunk 19615 ---
5.4.2.3 Note 1: The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described in 

--- Document Chunk 19616 ---
chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode". 

--- Document Chunk 19617 ---
5.4.2.4 Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table in 

--- Document Chunk 19618 ---
section 5.4.3.3. 

--- Document Chunk 19619 ---

 Degraded Situations 

--- Document Chunk 20503 ---
5.4.5.1 Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has 

--- Document Chunk 20504 ---
not been taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such 

--- Document Chunk 20505 ---
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On 

--- Document Chunk 20506 ---
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 20507 ---
5.4.5.2 The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does not 

--- Document Chunk 20508 ---
exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while performing 

--- Document Chunk 20509 ---
the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or when the 

--- Document Chunk 20510 ---
driver needs to re-enter already captured data). 

--- Document Chunk 20511 ---
5.4.5.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the following 

--- Document Chunk 20512 ---
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3: 

--- Document Chunk 20513 ---
a) only at S10 and S20 and if the conditions defined in 5.8.2.1 for Stand By are fulfilled, 

--- Document Chunk 20514 ---
to select “Override”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to the 

--- Document Chunk 20515 ---
procedure “Override” and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 20516 ---
shall delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”) 

--- Document Chunk 20517 ---
b) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Driver-ID 

--- Document Chunk 20518 ---
c) only at S10 and S20,to re-enter the “Train running number” 

--- Document Chunk 20519 ---
d) only at S20, to re-enter the Train data. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process 

--- Document Chunk 20520 ---
shall go to S12. 

--- Document Chunk 20521 ---
e) only at S10 and S20, to re -enter the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, t hen the 

--- Document Chunk 20522 ---
process shall go to S2 

--- Document Chunk 20523 ---
f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading ”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the 

--- Document Chunk 20524 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode 

--- Document Chunk 20525 ---
and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 

--- Document Chunk 20526 ---
position data (new status: “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 20527 ---
g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall 

--- Document Chunk 20528 ---
go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still invalid, the 

--- Document Chunk 20529 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 20530 ---
If, in level 2, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process shall go back to 

--- Document Chunk 20531 ---
S20. 

--- Document Chunk 20532 ---
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available, to select “Start”. If the driver chooses to 

--- Document Chunk 20533 ---
do so: 

--- Document Chunk 20534 ---
• if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23. 

--- Document Chunk 20535 ---
• if the level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22. 

--- Document Chunk 20536 ---
• if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24. 

--- Document Chunk 20537 ---
• if the level is 2 and a session is open, then the process shall go to S21. 

--- Document Chunk 20538 ---
• if the level is 2 and no session is open, then the process shall go to S24.

5.5 Procedure End of Mission 

--- Document Chunk 20575 ---
 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 20576 ---
5.5.1.1 End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the 

--- Document Chunk 20577 ---
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 20578 ---
when entering specific modes (see below). 

--- Document Chunk 20579 ---
 Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission: 

--- Document Chunk 20580 ---
5.5.2.1 Stand-By mode 

--- Document Chunk 20581 ---
5.5.2.1.1 From FS , AD , LS, OS, SM, UN, NL,  SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the 

--- Document Chunk 20582 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode is considered as an End of 

--- Document Chunk 20583 ---
Mission 

--- Document Chunk 20584 ---
5.5.2.1.2 Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 

--- Document Chunk 20585 ---
depend on the National System. 

--- Document Chunk 20586 ---
5.5.2.1.3 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the S tand-by mode, from PT 

--- Document Chunk 20587 ---
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission. 

--- Document Chunk 20588 ---
5.5.2.2 Intentionally deleted 

--- Document Chunk 20589 ---
5.5.2.3 Shunting mode 

--- Document Chunk 20590 ---
5.5.2.3.1 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS , 

--- Document Chunk 20591 ---
AD, LS, OS, SR, SM, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 20592 ---
5.5.2.3.2 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT 

--- Document Chunk 20593 ---
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission. 

--- Document Chunk 20594 ---
5.5.2.3.3 Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 

--- Document Chunk 20595 ---
depend on the National System. 

--- Document Chunk 20596 ---
 End of Mission Procedure 

--- Document Chunk 20597 ---
5.5.3.1 The procedure comprises the following steps 

--- Document Chunk 20598 ---
5.5.3.1.1 Step 1 - MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode 

--- Document Chunk 20599 ---
dependent, see Chapter 4, section "What happens to accepted and stored information 

--- Document Chunk 20600 ---
when Entering a Mode"). 

--- Document Chunk 20601 ---
End of Procedure, if there is no existing communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 20602 ---
5.5.3.1.2 If a communication session with an RIU exists: 

--- Document Chunk 20603 ---
Step 2 - The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication 

--- Document Chunk 20604 ---
session

5.5.3.1.3 If a communication session with an RBC exists: 

--- Document Chunk 20617 ---
Step 2 - The end of mission shall be reported to the RBC by means of the message 

--- Document Chunk 20618 ---
“End of Mission”. 

--- Document Chunk 20619 ---
End of Procedure, if the mode entered is Stand-By upon desk closure. 

--- Document Chunk 20620 ---
 Note: it is a trackside implementation issue to decide when it is appropriate to send a 

--- Document Chunk 20621 ---
session termination order to an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment having reported its 

--- Document Chunk 20622 ---
end of mission further to a desk closure. 

--- Document Chunk 20623 ---
5.5.3.1.4 If the mode entered is Shunting or Stand-By while a desk is still open (e.g. after the driver 

--- Document Chunk 20624 ---
has selected “Exit SM”) and a communication session with an RBC exists: 

--- Document Chunk 20625 ---
Step 3 -  The RBC shall request to terminate the communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 20626 ---
Step 4 - The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication 

--- Document Chunk 20627 ---
session 

--- Document Chunk 20628 ---
End of procedure 

--- Document Chunk 20629 ---
 Note: For the termination of the communication session refer to chapter 3, Management 

--- Document Chunk 20630 ---

5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside 

--- Document Chunk 20808 ---
 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 20809 ---
5.7.1.1 This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.  

--- Document Chunk 20810 ---
5.7.1.2 Note: The shunting area, possibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already occupied 

--- Document Chunk 20811 ---
by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that the train 

--- Document Chunk 20812 ---
shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed according 

--- Document Chunk 20813 ---
to the relevant procedure.   

--- Document Chunk 20814 ---
5.7.1.3 The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means o f a mode profile, optionally 

--- Document Chunk 20815 ---
with a list of balise groups, which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 20816 ---
equipment is in shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 20817 ---
5.7.1.4 The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires a 

--- Document Chunk 20818 ---
driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below. 

--- Document Chunk 20819 ---
5.7.1.5 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of 

--- Document Chunk 20820 ---
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed. 

--- Document Chunk 20821 ---
 Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from 

--- Document Chunk 20822 ---
Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 20823 ---
5.7.2.1 In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the begi nning of the 

--- Document Chunk 20824 ---
shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2 it is possible 

--- Document Chunk 20825 ---
to send an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment the order to switch to shunting at the 

--- Document Chunk 20826 ---
current location. 

--- Document Chunk 20827 ---
5.7.2.2 Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode profile 

--- Document Chunk 20828 ---
received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for which 

--- Document Chunk 20829 ---
switching to SH mode is requested. 

--- Document Chunk 20830 ---
5.7.2.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 

--- Document Chunk 20831 ---
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 20832 ---
transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 20833 ---
5.7.2.4 If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 20834 ---
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command sh all be 

--- Document Chunk 20835 ---
triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 20836 ---
 Shunting is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 20837 ---
5.7.3.1 An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent 

--- Document Chunk 20838 ---
a) in a level 1 area by a balise group, 

--- Document Chunk 20839 ---
b) in a level 2 area by the RBC.

5.8 Procedure Override 

--- Document Chunk 20952 ---
 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 20953 ---
5.8.1.1 In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track 

--- Document Chunk 20954 ---
circuit, failed point…), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority. 

--- Document Chunk 20955 ---
5.8.1.2 For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority can be required in degraded 

--- Document Chunk 20956 ---
situations, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 20957 ---
• In level 2, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable 

--- Document Chunk 20958 ---
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip). 

--- Document Chunk 20959 ---
• In level 2, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the 

--- Document Chunk 20960 ---
interface between RBCs is unavailable). 

--- Document Chunk 20961 ---
• In level 2, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two adjacent 

--- Document Chunk 20962 ---
RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established). 

--- Document Chunk 20963 ---
• In level 2, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection with 

--- Document Chunk 20964 ---
the interlocking) 

--- Document Chunk 20965 ---
• In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route cannot 

--- Document Chunk 20966 ---
be set) 

--- Document Chunk 20967 ---
• In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened due 

--- Document Chunk 20968 ---
to a time-out). 

--- Document Chunk 20969 ---
5.8.1.3 In level 0 /NTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The 

--- Document Chunk 20970 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not 

--- Document Chunk 20971 ---
supervise the train movements. 

--- Document Chunk 20972 ---
5.8.1.4 In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1 or 2), locations where the train shall stop are 

--- Document Chunk 20973 ---
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. Receiving an order from the 

--- Document Chunk 20974 ---
signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority, the driver must then be able to inhibit 

--- Document Chunk 20975 ---
this supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 20976 ---
5.8.1.4.1 Note: The driver must not us e the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside 

--- Document Chunk 20977 ---
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 20978 ---
5.8.1.5 If a signal at danger must be passed between announcement and execution of the level 

--- Document Chunk 20979 ---
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System 

--- Document Chunk 20980 ---
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1 or 2 ), the signalman gives the order to 

--- Document Chunk 20981 ---
the driver to select “override”. 

--- Document Chunk 20982 ---
5.8.1.6 Note: By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the train driving. Therefore 

--- Document Chunk 20983 ---
Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects “override”. 

--- Document Chunk 20984 ---
5.8.1.7 In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:  

--- Document Chunk 20985 ---
a) transmitting "stop if in SR mode" 

--- Document Chunk 20986 ---
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

5.8.1.8 Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR 

--- Document Chunk 21001 ---
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.6.5) 

--- Document Chunk 21002 ---
5.8.1.9 In case the Override procedure is selected while the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 21003 ---
considers a temporary EOA (as per clause 3.12.2.4, 3.12.4.7 or 3.12.5.8) which is closer 

--- Document Chunk 21004 ---
than the EOA, all the instances of the term EOA throughout this section 5.8 shall relate 

--- Document Chunk 21005 ---
to this temporary EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 21006 ---
 Selection of “Override” 

--- Document Chunk 21007 ---
5.8.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” only 

--- Document Chunk 21008 ---
when: 

--- Document Chunk 21009 ---
a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override” function 

--- Document Chunk 21010 ---
(national value) AND 

--- Document Chunk 21011 ---
b) The current mode is F ull Supervision, Automatic Driving , Limited Supervision, On 

--- Document Chunk 21012 ---
Sight, Staff Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2 only)  or 

--- Document Chunk 21013 ---
SN (National System) AND 

--- Document Chunk 21014 ---
c) Validated Train Data and Train running number are available (except when already in 

--- Document Chunk 21015 ---
Shunting mode). 

--- Document Chunk 21016 ---
5.8.2.2 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 21017 ---
5.8.2.3 The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 21018 ---
 Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered 

--- Document Chunk 21019 ---
5.8.3.1 The mode shall change as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 21020 ---
a) If the current mode is Ful l Supervision, Automatic Driving , Limited Supervision, On 

--- Document Chunk 21021 ---
Sight, Stand -By or Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff 

--- Document Chunk 21022 ---
Responsible (SR) mode (if the mode is already SR it remains unchanged) 

--- Document Chunk 21023 ---
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged 

--- Document Chunk 21024 ---
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or S N (level NTC area) the mode shall 

--- Document Chunk 21025 ---
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1 or 2 (refer to SRS 

--- Document Chunk 21026 ---
chapter 4, transitions between modes) 

--- Document Chunk 21027 ---
5.8.3.1.1 If the mode, when activating Override, is OS , LS, FS or AD, the former EOA/LOA shall 

--- Document Chunk 21028 ---
be retained. If the mode is SB or PT  and there is a valid train position stored on -board, 

--- Document Chunk 21029 ---
the current position of the train front shall be considered as the former EOA/LOA. If the 

--- Document Chunk 21030 ---

former EOA/LOA. 

--- Document Chunk 21043 ---
5.8.3.1.2 Note: This former EOA/LOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is no 

--- Document Chunk 21044 ---
longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the 

--- Document Chunk 21045 ---
former EOA/LOA. 

--- Document Chunk 21046 ---
5.8.3.1.3 The former EOA/LOA shall be deleted if: 

--- Document Chunk 21047 ---
a) the train reads the information “stop if in SR mode” from a balise group OR 

--- Document Chunk 21048 ---
b) SR mode is left. 

--- Document Chunk 21049 ---
5.8.3.2 Note 1: In level 2, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that the 

--- Document Chunk 21050 ---
Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is any) 

--- Document Chunk 21051 ---
5.8.3.3 Note 2: In level 2, if the ERTMS/ETCS - onboard equipment is able to report the mode 

--- Document Chunk 21052 ---
change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR mode 

--- Document Chunk 21053 ---
(overriding the national value), a list of balise groups to be passed in SR mode (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 21054 ---
chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode) 

--- Document Chunk 21055 ---
5.8.3.4 Note 3: In level 2, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes all 

--- Document Chunk 21056 ---
emergency stop orders previously received. 

--- Document Chunk 21057 ---
5.8.3.5 In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the 

--- Document Chunk 21058 ---
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode) 

--- Document Chunk 21059 ---
5.8.3.6 The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and only

in level 0, 1 or 2, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed Restriction 

--- Document Chunk 21061 ---
(see 3.11.10) as long as the Override function is active. 

--- Document Chunk 21062 ---
5.8.3.7 The status “override active” shall be indicated to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 21063 ---
5.8.3.7.1 Exception 1: In case the Override function has been activated by an STM (see SUBSET-

--- Document Chunk 21064 ---
035) and as long as the on -board is in level NTC , the status “override active” shall not 

--- Document Chunk 21065 ---
be indicated to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 21066 ---
5.8.3.7.2 Exception 2: In case the Override function has been activated by selection of “Override” 

--- Document Chunk 21067 ---
while being in level 0, 1 or 2, the status “override active” shall stop being indicated to the 

--- Document Chunk 21068 ---
driver on executing a transition to level NTC and shall remain unindicated as long as the 

--- Document Chunk 21069 ---
on-board is in level NTC. 

--- Document Chunk 21070 ---
5.8.3.8 As long as the Override function is active, new SR distance information received from 

--- Document Chunk 21071 ---
Euroloop shall be rejected. 

--- Document Chunk 21072 ---
5.8.3.9 When “Override” is selected and Override is already active, the supervision of the time

5.9 Procedure On-Sight 

--- Document Chunk 21118 ---
 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 21119 ---
5.9.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train 

--- Document Chunk 21120 ---
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the 

--- Document Chunk 21121 ---
beginning of the On Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 21122 ---
5.9.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The 

--- Document Chunk 21123 ---
conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below. 

--- Document Chunk 21124 ---
 On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from 

--- Document Chunk 21125 ---
Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 21126 ---
5.9.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that gives 

--- Document Chunk 21127 ---
the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this information, 

--- Document Chunk 21128 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode. 

--- Document Chunk 21129 ---
5.9.2.2 In a level 2 area, the ERTMS/ETC S on-board equipment can receive a mode profile 

--- Document Chunk 21130 ---
giving an On Sight area which the train position confidence interval already overlaps. If 

--- Document Chunk 21131 ---
starting from the min safe front end of the train this On Sight area is the furthest area that 

--- Document Chunk 21132 ---
the train position confidence interval overlaps within the mode profile, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 21133 ---
on-board equipment shall immediately switch to On Sight mode. 

--- Document Chunk 21134 ---
5.9.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall 

--- Document Chunk 21135 ---
be displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 21136 ---
5.9.2.4 If the driver has n ot acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 21137 ---
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to OS  mode, the service brake command shall be 

--- Document Chunk 21138 ---
triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 21139 ---
5.9.2.5 Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed cannot 

--- Document Chunk 21140 ---
exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the train speed 

--- Document Chunk 21141 ---
was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was allowed in Full 

--- Document Chunk 21142 ---
Supervision mode, in Automatic Driving mode , in Limited Supervision mode  or in Staff 

--- Document Chunk 21143 ---
Responsible mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately 

--- Document Chunk 21144 ---
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On 

--- Document Chunk 21145 ---
Sight supervision (see Figure 4).

mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 21181 ---
 On Sight is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 21182 ---
5.9.3.1 The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached yet. 

--- Document Chunk 21183 ---
This occurs when: 

--- Document Chunk 21184 ---
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 

--- Document Chunk 21185 ---
located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 21186 ---
b) In a level 2 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is located 

--- Document Chunk 21187 ---
at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 21188 ---
5.9.3.2 A reques t for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following 

--- Document Chunk 21189 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 21190 ---
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On 

--- Document Chunk 21191 ---
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   

--- Document Chunk 21192 ---
b) The speed is equal to or lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or 

--- Document Chunk 21193 ---
value given in the mode profile). 

--- Document Chunk 21194 ---
c) The current mode is not On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 21195 ---
5.9.3.3 The conditions 5.9.3.2 a) and b) define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”. 

--- Document Chunk 21196 ---
5.9.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 

--- Document Chunk 21197 ---
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

 Exit of On Sight mode

5.9.6.1 General rule 

--- Document Chunk 21265 ---
5.9.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode when the min safe 

--- Document Chunk 21266 ---
front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 21267 ---
5.9.6.2 First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA 

--- Document Chunk 21268 ---
5.9.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has the 

--- Document Chunk 21269 ---
same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA. 

--- Document Chunk 21270 ---
5.9.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On 

--- Document Chunk 21271 ---
Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 21272 ---
5.9.6.2.3 Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of the 

--- Document Chunk 21273 ---
supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has 

--- Document Chunk 21274 ---
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of the 

--- Document Chunk 21275 ---
On Sight area. This information  

--- Document Chunk 21276 ---
• can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means  (outside 

--- Document Chunk 21277 ---
scope of  ERTMS/ETCS), or 

--- Document Chunk 21278 ---
• can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a 

--- Document Chunk 21279 ---
“track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment displays to 

--- Document Chunk 21280 ---
the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current 

--- Document Chunk 21281 ---
section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this information to the 

--- Document Chunk 21282 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 21283 ---
5.9.6.2.4 Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to transmit an 

--- Document Chunk 21284 ---
MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS chapter 

--- Document Chunk 21285 ---
4, transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 21286 ---
5.9.6.3 Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA/LOA of the current MA 

--- Document Chunk 21287 ---
5.9.6.3.1 In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 21288 ---
area. 

--- Document Chunk 21289 ---
5.9.6.3.2 When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches either 

--- Document Chunk 21290 ---
to Full Supervision, to Limited Supervision or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 4,

5.10 Level Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 21363 ---
 General requirements 

--- Document Chunk 21364 ---
5.10.1.1 Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2 or NTC is supported 

--- Document Chunk 21365 ---
shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment via balise group or via the 

--- Document Chunk 21366 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 21367 ---
5.10.1.2 A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall consist 

--- Document Chunk 21368 ---
of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to the 

--- Document Chunk 21369 ---
border. 

--- Document Chunk 21370 ---
5.10.1.3 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a level transition announcement, 

--- Document Chunk 21371 ---
and if this announcement will result in a change of the on-board level, it shall immediately 

--- Document Chunk 21372 ---
inform the driver about the announced level transition. 

--- Document Chunk 21373 ---
5.10.1.3.1 Note: In a mixed level area the actual le vel of the on -board equipment may remain 

--- Document Chunk 21374 ---
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed. 

--- Document Chunk 21375 ---
5.10.1.4 At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level 

--- Document Chunk 21376 ---
transition order or a conditional level transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 21377 ---
5.10.1.4.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional level 

--- Document Chunk 21378 ---
transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. Also 

--- Document Chunk 21379 ---
sleeping units read balise groups.

5.10.1.5 If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall still 

--- Document Chunk 21393 ---
be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the 

--- Document Chunk 21394 ---
announcement. 

--- Document Chunk 21395 ---
5.10.1.6 The on-board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. Therefore 

--- Document Chunk 21396 ---
a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order  that has not yet  

--- Document Chunk 21397 ---
been executed. 

--- Document Chunk 21398 ---
5.10.1.6.1 If a level transition order has not yet been executed but the driver ch anges the level 

--- Document Chunk 21399 ---
manually (see 3.18.4.2.4) this shall delete the level transition order..

“Available for use”, it will select level 2. 

--- Document Chunk 21484 ---
5.10.2.5 When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level 

--- Document Chunk 21485 ---
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore

5.10.3.14 Conditional level transition order 

--- Document Chunk 21760 ---
5.10.3.14.1 When the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment accepts a conditional level transition order 

--- Document Chunk 21761 ---
the onboard shall check whether the current level is contained in the priority list of the 

--- Document Chunk 21762 ---
conditional level transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 21763 ---
5.10.3.14.2 If the current level is contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition order, 

--- Document Chunk 21764 ---
the onboard shall not change the level. 

--- Document Chunk 21765 ---
5.10.3.14.3 If the current level is not contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition 

--- Document Chunk 21766 ---
order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the same way 

--- Document Chunk 21767 ---
as an immediate level transition order (see section 5.10.2). 

--- Document Chunk 21768 ---
5.10.3.14.4 In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 21769 ---
shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside.

5.10.3.14.5 Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in 

--- Document Chunk 21781 ---
a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold movement. The level of a 

--- Document Chunk 21782 ---
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the

5.10.3.15 Transition initiated by driver 

--- Document Chunk 21785 ---
5.10.3.15.1 In addition to th e level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possible, at standstill, 

--- Document Chunk 21786 ---
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2). 

--- Document Chunk 21787 ---
5.10.3.15.2 If the driver changes the level to 2, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall establish 

--- Document Chunk 21788 ---
a communication session with the RBC: 

--- Document Chunk 21789 ---
a) immediately if valid RBC contact information is available and 

--- Document Chunk 21790 ---
• the FRMCS on-board is registered to the FRMCS Radio Network, in case the 

--- Document Chunk 21791 ---
stored Radio Network type is FRMCS or is FRMCS+GSM -R while FRMCS is 

--- Document Chunk 21792 ---
the only radio system installed on-board, OR 

--- Document Chunk 21793 ---
• the FRMCS on-board is registered to the FRMCS Radio Network and at least 

--- Document Chunk 21794 ---
one GSM-R Mobile Terminal is registered to a GSM-R Radio Network, in case 

--- Document Chunk 21795 ---
the stored Radio Network type is FRMCS+GSM -R while both radio systems 

--- Document Chunk 21796 ---
are installed on-board, OR 

--- Document Chunk 21797 ---
• at least one GSM-R Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, in case 

--- Document Chunk 21798 ---
the stored Radio Network type is GSM-R or is FRMCS+GSM-R while GSM-R 

--- Document Chunk 21799 ---
is the only radio system installed on-board,  

--- Document Chunk 21800 ---
OR 

--- Document Chunk 21801 ---
b) once the driver has selected the R adio data (by the same means as for Start of 

--- Document Chunk 21802 ---
Mission), if the conditions listed in item a) are not fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 21803 ---
 Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC contact 

--- Document Chunk 21804 ---
information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in PT mode. 

--- Document Chunk 21805 ---
5.10.3.15.3 If the driver changes the level from 2 to any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 21806 ---
shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is established. When 

--- Document Chunk 21807 ---
receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the communication session to be 

--- Document Chunk 21808 ---
terminated. 

--- Document Chunk 21809 ---
5.10.3.15.4 In case the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has reported having changed from level 

--- Document Chunk 21810 ---
2 to any other and no order to terminate the session is received within a fixed waiting 

--- Document Chunk 21811 ---
time (see Appendix A.3.1) from the time the position report was sent, it shall repeatedly 

--- Document Chunk 21812 ---
send a position report with the fixed waiti ng time after each repetition, until the order to 

--- Document Chunk 21813 ---
terminate the session is received, or the defined number of repetitions (see Appendix 

--- Document Chunk 21814 ---
A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last 

--- Document Chunk 21815 ---
repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment shall terminate the communication 

--- Document Chunk 21816 ---
session.

5.12 Change of Train Orientation 

--- Document Chunk 22175 ---
 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 22176 ---
5.12.1.1 The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the 

--- Document Chunk 22177 ---
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction con troller in FORWARD 

--- Document Chunk 22178 ---
position. 

--- Document Chunk 22179 ---
5.12.1.2 This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to 

--- Document Chunk 22180 ---
change the driving cab. 

--- Document Chunk 22181 ---
5.12.1.3 The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver 

--- Document Chunk 22182 ---
changes the running direction of the  train without leaving the cab, by changing the 

--- Document Chunk 22183 ---
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE. 

--- Document Chunk 22184 ---
5.12.1.4 The scope of this procedure is NOT the reverse movement that is allowed in Post Trip 

--- Document Chunk 22185 ---
or in Reversing mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22186 ---
5.12.1.5 The scope of this procedure is NOT Supe rvised Manoeuvre movements, during which 

--- Document Chunk 22187 ---
the train orientation can change according to the last received SM authorisation and the 

--- Document Chunk 22188 ---
driver changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the 

--- Document Chunk 22189 ---
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE. 

--- Document Chunk 22190 ---
 The driver uses the same engine (a mission is ongoing) 

--- Document Chunk 22191 ---
5.12.2.1 The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the 

--- Document Chunk 22192 ---
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine. 

--- Document Chunk 22193 ---
5.12.2.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 22194 ---
5.12.2.3 When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment immediately 

--- Document Chunk 22195 ---
goes to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see “End of Mission” 

--- Document Chunk 22196 ---
procedure). 

--- Document Chunk 22197 ---
5.12.2.4 When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 22198 ---
5.12.2.5 When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the 

--- Document Chunk 22199 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position data 

--- Document Chunk 22200 ---
(train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data. 

--- Document Chunk 22201 ---
 The driver leaves the engine to go to another one 

--- Document Chunk 22202 ---
5.12.3.1 The described situation is the following: The train has two engines (engine A and engine 

--- Document Chunk 22203 ---
B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave engine. Each engine has 

--- Document Chunk 22204 ---
its own ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 22205 ---
a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on -board equipment is in Sleeping mode.  

--- Document Chunk 22206 ---
Note: The mode is entered when on -board equipment detects the presence of the 

--- Document Chunk 22207 ---
"remote control" signal.

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading engine 

--- Document Chunk 22219 ---
but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment is in Non 

--- Document Chunk 22220 ---
leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22221 ---
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting opera tion) by the leading 

--- Document Chunk 22222 ---
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 22223 ---
is in Passive Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22224 ---
5.12.3.2 Assumption: The train configuration does not change. 

--- Document Chunk 22225 ---
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave 

--- Document Chunk 22226 ---
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 22227 ---
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will 

--- Document Chunk 22228 ---
be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, afterwards 

--- Document Chunk 22229 ---
engine A will be in NL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in 

--- Document Chunk 22230 ---
PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22231 ---
5.12.3.3 Case "Engine B was in SL mode" 

--- Document Chunk 22232 ---
5.12.3.3.1 The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 

--- Document Chunk 22233 ---
engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission 

--- Document Chunk 22234 ---
(see “End of Mission” procedure) 

--- Document Chunk 22235 ---
5.12.3.3.2 As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 22236 ---
of engine B switches to Stand-By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22237 ---
5.12.3.3.3 Level 2: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of engine B opens a communication 

--- Document Chunk 22238 ---
session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22239 ---
5.12.3.3.4 When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure. 

--- Document Chunk 22240 ---
5.12.3.4 Case "Engine B was in NL mode" 

--- Document Chunk 22241 ---
5.12.3.4.1 The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches 

--- Document Chunk 22242 ---
to Non Leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22243 ---
5.12.3.4.2 Once the non leading input signal is not received any more, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 22244 ---
equipment of engine B will switch to Stand-By mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions 

--- Document Chunk 22245 ---
between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure). 

--- Document Chunk 22246 ---
5.12.3.4.3 Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment enters Stand-

--- Document Chunk 22247 ---
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 22248 ---
5.12.3.5 Case "Engine B was in PS mode" 

--- Document Chunk 22249 ---
5.12.3.5.1 The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure". The ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 22250 ---
equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes the desk of engine 

--- Document Chunk 22251 ---
A. 

--- Document Chunk 22252 ---
5.12.3.5.2 The driver opens a desk in engine B, and ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Shunting

 The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is ongoing) 

--- Document Chunk 22265 ---
5.12.4.1 The situation is the following: while the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 22266 ---
mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting engine, to go 

--- Document Chunk 22267 ---
to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.

5.12.4.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 22269 ---
5.12.4.2.1 Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk

closure”. When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 22271 ---
shall immediately go to Passive Shunting mode.

5.13 Train Reversing 

--- Document Chunk 22288 ---
5.13.1.1 This procedure is intended to allow the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run away 

--- Document Chunk 22289 ---
from a danger up to a “safe” location. 

--- Document Chunk 22290 ---
5.13.1.2 The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 22291 ---
on-board equipment by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).  

--- Document Chunk 22292 ---
5.13.1.3 While the train front end is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver 

--- Document Chunk 22293 ---
shall be informed that reversing is possible 

--- Document Chunk 22294 ---
5.13.1.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard  detects the driver’s intention to reverse (e.g. from a 

--- Document Chunk 22295 ---
direction controller in reverse position), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ask 

--- Document Chunk 22296 ---
the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22297 ---
5.13.1.5 If the driver acknowledges, the on-board equipment shall switch to RV mode 

--- Document Chunk 22298 ---
5.13.1.6 Once in RV mode, it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted distance 

--- Document Chunk 22299 ---
to run and a new maximum speed. 

--- Document Chunk 22300 ---
5.13.1.7 Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the 

--- Document Chunk 22301 ---
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for the 

--- Document Chunk 22302 ---
new permitted distance to run. 

--- Document Chunk 22303 ---
5.13.1.8 Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside 

--- Document Chunk 22304 ---
that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

5.14 Joining / Splitting 

--- Document Chunk 22317 ---
 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 22318 ---
5.14.1.1 Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for being split. 

--- Document Chunk 22319 ---
The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train before splitting, the “new 

--- Document Chunk 22320 ---
train after splitting”, refers to the other part. 

--- Document Chunk 22321 ---
5.14.1.2 Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 

--- Document Chunk 22322 ---
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation. 

--- Document Chunk 22323 ---
 Procedure “Splitting” 

--- Document Chunk 22324 ---
5.14.2.1 Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links bet ween the two trains must be removed 

--- Document Chunk 22325 ---
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS). 

--- Document Chunk 22326 ---
5.14.2.1.1 Note: If splitting require s moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small 

--- Document Chunk 22327 ---
distance, this can be done even in SB mode 

--- Document Chunk 22328 ---
5.14.2.2 Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train before 

--- Document Chunk 22329 ---
splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the Train Data must be 

--- Document Chunk 22330 ---
modified (e.g. by the driver) such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting. 

--- Document Chunk 22331 ---
For level 2, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / 

--- Document Chunk 22332 ---
Modification Process) 

--- Document Chunk 22333 ---
5.14.2.3 Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 

--- Document Chunk 22334 ---
in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control s ignal is not 

--- Document Chunk 22335 ---
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  

--- Document Chunk 22336 ---
For Level 2: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment opens a communication session (if 

--- Document Chunk 22337 ---
possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22338 ---
5.14.2.4 Step 2c - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 

--- Document Chunk 22339 ---
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not 

--- Document Chunk 22340 ---
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5, 

--- Document Chunk 22341 ---
“end of mission” procedure).  

--- Document Chunk 22342 ---
5.14.2.5 The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the 

--- Document Chunk 22343 ---
“Start of Mission” procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility. 

--- Document Chunk 22344 ---
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible. 

--- Document Chunk 22345 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 22346 ---
 Procedure “Joining” 

--- Document Chunk 22347 ---
5.14.3.1 Step 1 - The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be performed 

--- Document Chunk 22348 ---
in SR, OS, SM or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the national 

--- Document Chunk 22349 ---
procedure for joining).

5.14.3.2 Step 2 - The electrical and mechanical li nks between the two trains must be closed 

--- Document Chunk 22361 ---
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS). 

--- Document Chunk 22362 ---
5.14.3.3 Step 3a - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment remains leading and 

--- Document Chunk 22363 ---
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with 

--- Document Chunk 22364 ---
the new train composition. For level 2, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS 

--- Document Chunk 22365 ---
chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process) 

--- Document Chunk 22366 ---
5.14.3.4 Step 3b - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 

--- Document Chunk 22367 ---
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 22368 ---
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of 

--- Document Chunk 22369 ---
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). Transition to SL mode 

--- Document Chunk 22370 ---
is from SB mode. 

--- Document Chunk 22371 ---
5.14.3.5 Step 3c - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave 

--- Document Chunk 22372 ---
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode  (see SRS chapter 4, transitions 

--- Document Chunk 22373 ---
between modes).  

--- Document Chunk 22374 ---
5.14.3.6 For further steps after joining refer to procedures “Start of Mission” and “Change of Train

5.15 RBC/RBC Handover 

--- Document Chunk 22387 ---
 Principles 

--- Document Chunk 22388 ---
5.15.1.1 Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 22389 ---
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22390 ---
5.15.1.2 The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 22391 ---
equipment shall consist of an order to establish a communication session with  the 

--- Document Chunk 22392 ---
Accepting RBC (see 3.5. 2.6.2) and to execute the handover at a further location 

--- Document Chunk 22393 ---
corresponding to the border. 

--- Document Chunk 22394 ---
5.15.1.2.1 In case of RBC/RBC handover including a change of Radio Network type and/or a 

--- Document Chunk 22395 ---
change of GSM -R Radio Network , ERTMS/ETCS trackside is responsible for the 

--- Document Chunk 22396 ---
sequence of Radio Network trans ition order and order to establish a communication 

--- Document Chunk 22397 ---
session with the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio Network’s configuration. The 

--- Document Chunk 22398 ---
following Radio Network transitions are possible: 

--- Document Chunk 22399 ---
t1 GSM-R => FRMCS  (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only store s the 

--- Document Chunk 22400 ---
Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration); 

--- Document Chunk 22401 ---
t2 FRMCS => GSM-R; 

--- Document Chunk 22402 ---
t3 GSM-Rx => FRMCS+GSM -Rx (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only 

--- Document Chunk 22403 ---
stores the Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration); 

--- Document Chunk 22404 ---
t4 GSM-Rx => FRMCS+GSM-Ry; 

--- Document Chunk 22405 ---
t5 FRMCS+GSM-Rx => GSM -Rx (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only 

--- Document Chunk 22406 ---
stores the Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration); 

--- Document Chunk 22407 ---
t6 FRMCS+GSM-Rx => GSM-Ry, communication session with “Handing Over” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22408 ---
through FRMCS; 

--- Document Chunk 22409 ---
t7 FRMCS+GSM-Rx => GSM-Ry, communication session with “Handing Over” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22410 ---
through GSM-Rx; 

--- Document Chunk 22411 ---
t8 FRMCS => FRMCS+GSM-R; 

--- Document Chunk 22412 ---
t9 FRMCS+GSM-R => FRMCS (for completeness reason, i.e. the on -board only 

--- Document Chunk 22413 ---
stores the Radio Network type and does not order any radio network registration); 

--- Document Chunk 22414 ---
t10 FRMCS+GSM-Rx => FRMCS+GSM -Ry, communication session with “Handing 

--- Document Chunk 22415 ---
Over” RBC through FRMCS; 

--- Document Chunk 22416 ---
t11 FRMCS+GSM-Rx => FRMCS+GSM -Ry, communication session with “Handing 

--- Document Chunk 22417 ---
Over” RBC through GSM-Rx; 

--- Document Chunk 22418 ---
t12 GSM-Rx => GSM-Ry. 

--- Document Chunk 22419 ---
5.15.1.2.2 In the following sections, if both radio communication sessions with “Handing Over” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22420 ---
and “Accepting” RBC are established with GSM-R, "first" GSM-R Mobile Terminal refers 

--- Document Chunk 22421 ---

5.15.2.1 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 22446 ---
5.15.2.1.1 In the normal operation, the main func tional steps needed for running from one RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22447 ---
area to another one are the following: 

--- Document Chunk 22448 ---
a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over” RBC; 

--- Document Chunk 22449 ---
b) Depending on the Radio Network transition and the radio system through which the 

--- Document Chunk 22450 ---
“Handing Over” RBC communicat ion session is established, registration to the 

--- Document Chunk 22451 ---
FRMCS network of the FRMCS on -board equipment and/or registration  to the new 

--- Document Chunk 22452 ---
GSM-R Radio Network of second GSM-R Mobile Terminal & Establishment of the 

--- Document Chunk 22453 ---
radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC; 

--- Document Chunk 22454 ---
c) Generation of movement authorities including the border; 

--- Document Chunk 22455 ---
d) Announcement of the RBC transition 

--- Document Chunk 22456 ---
e) Transfer of train supervision to the “Accepting” RBC; 

--- Document Chunk 22457 ---
f) Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22458 ---
g) Only in case of GSM-R Radio Network change and if the radio communication session 

--- Document Chunk 22459 ---
with the “Handing over” RBC was established through GSM -R: Registration to the 

--- Document Chunk 22460 ---
new GSM-R Radio Network of first GSM-R Mobile Terminal

5.15.2.2 Step by step description  

--- Document Chunk 22462 ---
5.15.2.2.1 Pre-announcement 

--- Document Chunk 22463 ---
 When the “Handing Over” RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the 

--- Document Chunk 22464 ---
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition. 

--- Document Chunk 22465 ---
 The “Handing Over” RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC handover.

equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over” RBC or 

--- Document Chunk 22481 ---
from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio communication"). 

--- Document Chunk 22482 ---
 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Networ k change, the registration to

--- Document Chunk 22486 ---
is transmitted to the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 22487 ---
 Depending on whether the communication session with the “Handing Over” RBC is 

--- Document Chunk 22488 ---
established with FRMCS (see t2, t6, t8, t10 in 5.15.1.2.1), the registration to the new

5.15.2.2.4 Announcement 

--- Document Chunk 22530 ---
 When the train reaches the border with its max safe front end, the ERTMS/ETCS on-

--- Document Chunk 22531 ---
board equipment sends a position report both to the “Handing Over” RBC and to the 

--- Document Chunk 22532 ---
“Accepting” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22533 ---
 The “Handing Over” RBC forwards the announcement information to the “Accepting” 

--- Document Chunk 22534 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22535 ---
5.15.2.2.4.2.1 Note: The forwarding of the announcement information is executed because the 

--- Document Chunk 22536 ---
“Handing Over” RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in a 

--- Document Chunk 22537 ---
degraded situation or not i.e. whether it can handle one or two communication sessions. 

--- Document Chunk 22538 ---
5.15.2.2.5 Transfer of train supervision to “Accepting” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22539 ---
 As soon as the on-board has sent to the “Accepting” RBC the position report referred 

--- Document Chunk 22540 ---
to in 5.15.2.2.4.1 , it considers to be supervised by the “Accepting” RBC i.e. it uses 

--- Document Chunk 22541 ---
information received from the “Accepting” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 22542 ---
 When the “Accepting” RBC receives a position report from the on-board and detects 

--- Document Chunk 22543 ---
that the max safe front end has passed the border, it takes over the responsibility and 

--- Document Chunk 22544 ---
informs the “Handing Over” RBC.  

--- Document Chunk 22545 ---
5.15.2.2.6 Termination of the session with “Handing Over” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22546 ---
 When the min safe rear end of the train passes the location of the border, the 

--- Document Chunk 22547 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment sends a position report to the “Handing Over” RBC.  

--- Document Chunk 22548 ---
 It is a trackside implementation issue to decide when it is appropriate to  send the 

--- Document Chunk 22549 ---
session termination order to the on-board equipment, e.g. when the ”Handing Over” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 22550 ---
receives a position report and detects that the minimum safe rear end of the train has 

--- Document Chunk 22551 ---

--- Document Chunk 22675 ---
 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 22676 ---
5.16.1.1 In case the LX is not protected, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (in FS, AD, LS, 

--- Document Chunk 22677 ---
OS or SM mode) first supervises the LX start location as both temporary EOA and SvL, 

--- Document Chunk 22678 ---
with no release speed (see 3.12.5.8). 

--- Document Chunk 22679 ---
5.16.1.2 The supervision of the LX start location as both temporary EOA and SvL shall be 

--- Document Chunk 22680 ---
substituted by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP under  conditions 

--- Document Chunk 22681 ---
depending on whether stopping in rear of the LX start location is required or not. The 

--- Document Chunk 22682 ---
conditions of this substitution are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3. 

--- Document Chunk 22683 ---
5.16.1.3 The start location of the LX speed restriction depends on the substitution conditions, 

--- Document Chunk 22684 ---
which are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3. The end location of the LX speed restriction shall 

--- Document Chunk 22685 ---
be the LX end location. 

--- Document Chunk 22686 ---
5.16.1.4 When approaching a non protected LX, the on -board equipment shall inform the driver 

--- Document Chunk 22687 ---
about the status of the LX, as soon as:  

--- Document Chunk 22688 ---
a) either the temporary EOA or the temporary SvL related to the LX start location 

--- Document Chunk 22689 ---
becomes the Most Relevant Displayed Target (see 3.13.10.4.2), or 

--- Document Chunk 22690 ---
b) the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment substitutes the supervision of the LX start 

--- Document Chunk 22691 ---
location as both temporary EOA and SvL by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction 

--- Document Chunk 22692 ---
in the MRSP. 

--- Document Chunk 22693 ---
5.16.1.5 Unless the information “LX is protected” is received on-board, the indication given to the 

--- Document Chunk 22694 ---
driver shall be displayed as long as the train min safe front end is in rear of the LX end 

--- Document Chunk 22695 ---
location.

5.17 Changing Train Data from sources different from the driver 

--- Document Chunk 22766 ---
 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 22767 ---
5.17.1.1 When valid Train Data is stored on-board, input information acquired from ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 22768 ---
external sources different from the driver may affect some of the Train Data, depending 

--- Document Chunk 22769 ---
on the type of train (e.g. tilting input information from tilting external device may affect 

--- Document Chunk 22770 ---
the train category and the loading gauge). 

--- Document Chunk 22771 ---
5.17.1.2 The procedure here below describes the necessary steps performed by the 

--- Document Chunk 22772 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment from the detection of an input information change on 

--- Document Chunk 22773 ---
an external interface, to the effective encountering of the Train Data change by th e 

--- Document Chunk 22774 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 22775 ---
5.17.1.3 This procedure is not applicable for trains running in RV mode: on leaving RV mode, the 

--- Document Chunk 22776 ---
Train Data will always be invalidated or deleted.

5.19 Procedure Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 23498 ---
 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 23499 ---
5.19.1.1 The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode 

--- Document Chunk 23500 ---
profile. 

--- Document Chunk 23501 ---
5.19.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from 

--- Document Chunk 23502 ---
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below. 

--- Document Chunk 23503 ---
 Limited Supervision is requested for current location (from modes 

--- Document Chunk 23504 ---
different from Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 23505 ---
5.19.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise (group) 

--- Document Chunk 23506 ---
that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this 

--- Document Chunk 23507 ---
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Limited 

--- Document Chunk 23508 ---
Supervision mode. 

--- Document Chunk 23509 ---
5.19.2.2 In a level 2 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile 

--- Document Chunk 23510 ---
giving a Limited Supervision area which the train position confidence interval  already 

--- Document Chunk 23511 ---
overlaps. If starting from the min safe front end of the train this Limited Supervision area 

--- Document Chunk 23512 ---
is the furthest area that the train position confidence interval overlaps within the mode 

--- Document Chunk 23513 ---
profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to Limited 

--- Document Chunk 23514 ---
Supervision mode. 

--- Document Chunk 23515 ---
5.19.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supe rvision mode. A request of 

--- Document Chunk 23516 ---
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 23517 ---
5.19.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 23518 ---
Appendix A .3.1) after the change to LS  mode, the service brake command  shall be 

--- Document Chunk 23519 ---
triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 23520 ---
5.19.2.5 Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train 

--- Document Chunk 23521 ---
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 23522 ---
mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because a higher speed 

--- Document Chunk 23523 ---
was allowed in Full Supervision mode, in Automatic Driving mode, in On Sight mode or 

--- Document Chunk 23524 ---
in Staff Responsible mode) then a service/emergency brake  command could be 

--- Document Chunk 23525 ---
immediately triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because 

--- Document Chunk 23526 ---
of the LS supervision (see Figure 22).

--- Document Chunk 23559 ---
5.19.2.7 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in LS mode when receiving the LS 

--- Document Chunk 23560 ---
mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 23561 ---
 Limited Supervision is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 23562 ---
5.19.3.1 The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not 

--- Document Chunk 23563 ---
reached yet. This occurs when: 

--- Document Chunk 23564 ---
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision area 

--- Document Chunk 23565 ---
that is located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 23566 ---
b) In a level 2 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision area that 

--- Document Chunk 23567 ---
is located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 23568 ---
5.19.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be di splayed to the driver when the following 

--- Document Chunk 23569 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 23570 ---
a) The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of Limited 

--- Document Chunk 23571 ---
Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   

--- Document Chunk 23572 ---
b) The speed is equal to or lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national 

--- Document Chunk 23573 ---
value, or value given in the mode profile). 

--- Document Chunk 23574 ---
c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 23575 ---
5.19.3.3 Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”. 

--- Document Chunk 23576 ---
5.19.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 

--- Document Chunk 23577 ---
leaves the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

S0 The level is 2, the train position is valid and is referred to an LRBG, the safe consist 

--- Document Chunk 24190 ---
length is available, the train is at standstill, and the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 24191 ---
is in: 

--- Document Chunk 24192 ---
• FS, AD, OS, LS, SR, PT or SB mode, while no RBC transition order is stored 

--- Document Chunk 24193 ---
on-board, OR 

--- Document Chunk 24194 ---
• SM mode 

--- Document Chunk 24195 ---
When the driver selects Supervised Manoeuvre (E015) the process shall go to A045. 

--- Document Chunk 24196 ---
A045 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall send the “Supervised Manoeuvre 

--- Document Chunk 24197 ---
Request” message to the RBC together with a position report and the safe consist length 

--- Document Chunk 24198 ---
information for Supervised Manoeuvre  and, if the mode is different from SM, the 

--- Document Chunk 24199 ---
following default Train Data for Supervised Manoeuvre: 

--- Document Chunk 24200 ---
a) Train category(ies). 

--- Document Chunk 24201 ---
b) Maximum train speed. 

--- Document Chunk 24202 ---
c) Loading gauge. 

--- Document Chunk 24203 ---
d) Axle load category. 

--- Document Chunk 24204 ---
e) Traction system(s) accepted by the engine. 

--- Document Chunk 24205 ---
f) Train fitted with airtight system. 

--- Document Chunk 24206 ---
g) Axle number. 

--- Document Chunk 24207 ---
The content of the position report takes into account the safe consist length information 

--- Document Chunk 24208 ---
(in particular the train front end information is derived from the safe consist length values 

--- Document Chunk 24209 ---
in front of the engine). 

--- Document Chunk 24210 ---
If the mode is different from SB or SM, this first SM request will allow the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 24211 ---
determining the position of the engine and its active cab within the shunting consist. 

--- Document Chunk 24212 ---
The process shall go to S050. 

--- Document Chunk 24213 ---
S050 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment awaits the reply to the SM request. 

--- Document Chunk 24214 ---
If an SM authorisation is received from the RBC (E115), the process shall go to D080. 

--- Document Chunk 24215 ---
If “SM refused” is received from the RBC (E215), the process shall go to A220.

5.22 Procedure Inhibition of balise transmission alarm reaction 

--- Document Chunk 24307 ---
 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 24308 ---
5.22.1.1 As explained in 3.15.7, when the balise reading antenna is over a large metallic object 

--- Document Chunk 24309 ---
that exceeds the Subset-036 limits (something usually called “Big Metal Mass” and in the 

--- Document Chunk 24310 ---
following referred to as “BMM”) an alarm may be generated by the balise transmission 

--- Document Chunk 24311 ---
system, which in turn may trigger an on-board safe reaction. 

--- Document Chunk 24312 ---
5.22.1.2 Such “integrity check alarm of balise transmission” (in the following: “BTM alarm”) tha t 

--- Document Chunk 24313 ---
may be generated when the balise antenna is over a BMM is not distinguishable from 

--- Document Chunk 24314 ---
one that may be generated when the on-board balise reader system is in failure. 

--- Document Chunk 24315 ---
5.22.1.3 Since it is not possible for the on-board to know whether the alarm was generated by a 

--- Document Chunk 24316 ---
failure (and therefore the on-board may be unable to read balises) or by the presence of 

--- Document Chunk 24317 ---
a BMM under the balise antenna, it is possible that a safe reaction is taken by the on -

--- Document Chunk 24318 ---
board (for example switch to SF) when it is in fact still able to read balises. 

--- Document Chunk 24319 ---
5.22.1.4 The track condition “Big Metal Mass” provides a means for trackside to mark areas where 

--- Document Chunk 24320 ---
BMMs are known to exist, and so to avoid that the on -board may take a safe reaction 

--- Document Chunk 24321 ---
when there is no need to (the on-board is able to detect balises but the antenna is over 

--- Document Chunk 24322 ---
a BMM). 

--- Document Chunk 24323 ---
5.22.1.5 However, there may be instances where the train is over a known BMM but the related 

--- Document Chunk 24324 ---
track condition is not available on -board. For example, because the train is awakening 

--- Document Chunk 24325 ---
on a metal covered area or because the driver had to select override and move the train 

--- Document Chunk 24326 ---
over a metal covered area. This can result in deadlocks. 

--- Document Chunk 24327 ---
5.22.1.6 To avoid that, the procedure detailed in this section provides a means for the driver to 

--- Document Chunk 24328 ---
inhibit the potential safe reaction to a BTM alarm. This in turn enables a SoM or a generic 

--- Document Chunk 24329 ---
movement over a BMM in an ETCS equipped area ( level 1 or 2) when no BMM track 

--- Document Chunk 24330 ---
condition is stored on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 24331 ---
5.22.1.7 Note: The driver should use the “Inhibition” procedure only when authorised to do so. 

--- Document Chunk 24332 ---
This authorisation should be covered by operational procedures because to inhibit a safe 

--- Document Chunk 24333 ---
reaction may be detrimental to safety. 

--- Document Chunk 24334 ---
5.22.1.8 In addition, a provision is introduced to allow the procedure to be automatically triggered 

--- Document Chunk 24335 ---
without driver intervention. This provision applies in case the train is in an area covered 

--- Document Chunk 24336 ---
by a BMM track condition stored on board, and the track condition gets reset (for example 

--- Document Chunk 24337 ---
because of a transition to SR mode caused by Override activation). 

--- Document Chunk 24338 ---
 Manual triggering of the procedure 

--- Document Chunk 24339 ---
5.22.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Inhibiti on of 

--- Document Chunk 24340 ---
reaction to BTM alarm” only at standstill when the level is 1 or 2 and the current mode is 

--- Document Chunk 24341 ---
Stand-By, Shunting, or Staff Responsible.

--- Document Chunk 24351 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 24352 ---
5.22.2.2 As soon as the driver makes the selection, the “Inhibition” procedure shall be triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 24353 ---
 Automatic triggering of the procedure 

--- Document Chunk 24354 ---
5.22.3.1 As soon as a stored BMM track condition is reset, the “ Inhibition” procedure shall be 

--- Document Chunk 24355 ---
automatically triggered provided that at the time of the reset the Eurobalise antenna is in 

--- Document Chunk 24356 ---
an area where that track condition is reset, takin g into account the max and min safe 

--- Document Chunk 24357 ---
antenna positions. 

--- Document Chunk 24358 ---
5.22.3.1.1 Exception: the automatic triggering of the “ Inhibition” procedure shall not apply in case 

--- Document Chunk 24359 ---
the reset is caused by a transition to NP or RV mode. 

--- Document Chunk 24360 ---
 Once the “Inhibition” procedure has been triggered 

--- Document Chunk 24361 ---
5.22.4.1 An indication shall be given to the driver, until the procedure is ended. 

--- Document Chunk 24362 ---
5.22.4.2 Any potential on-board reaction to a “BTM alarm” shall be inhibited. 

--- Document Chunk 24363 ---
 End of “Inhibition” procedure 

--- Document Chunk 24364 ---
5.22.5.1 The “Inhibition” procedure shall end when at least one of the following conditions is 

--- Document Chunk 24365 ---
fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 24366 ---
a) The train has run more than the fixed distance defined in A.3.1 after the procedure 

--- Document Chunk 24367 ---
was triggered, OR 

--- Document Chunk 24368 ---
b) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches to a mode different than Standby, 

--- Document Chunk 24369 ---
Shunting or Staff Responsible, OR 

--- Document Chunk 24370 ---
c) The driver ends the procedure, by revoking the inhibition. 

--- Document Chunk 24371 ---
5.22.5.2 Regarding a) above, the distance is the one travelled away from the location when the 

--- Document Chunk 24372 ---
procedure was triggered and it shall be applicable in both directions. 

--- Document Chunk 24373 ---
5.22.5.2.1 Exception: if a BMM track condition which announces a BMM area within the remaining 

--- Document Chunk 24374 ---
distance of the manual or automatic inhibition is received, the distance for ending the 

--- Document Chunk 24375 ---
procedure shall be shortened to the start of the announced BMM area. 

--- Document Chunk 24376 ---
5.22.5.3 Note: the driver may revoke the inhibition following an operational procedure. For 

--- Document Chunk 24377 ---
example, in the case of awakening over a BMM the train has moved past the limit of the 

--- Document Chunk 24378 ---
metallic covered area and so there is no more need to have the inhibition active. 

--- Document Chunk 24379 ---
Revoking the inhibition in turn increases safety, because it allows the on-board to have 

--- Document Chunk 24380 ---
a safe reaction should there be a failure in the balise reader system that was until then 

--- Document Chunk 24381 ---
“masked” by the inhibition set manually or automatically.

6.3 Scope 

--- Document Chunk 24571 ---
6.3.1.1 The chapter defines: 

--- Document Chunk 24572 ---
a) the composition of envelope of legally operated system versions, i.e. all the 

--- Document Chunk 24573 ---
ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate. 

--- Document Chunk 24574 ---
b) the allowed envelopes of system versions supported by the on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 24575 ---
6.3.1.2 By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters are applicable regardless of 

--- Document Chunk 24576 ---
the system version operated (see SUBSET-104 § 6.1.3.2); this chapter includes the 

--- Document Chunk 24577 ---
exceptions to those clauses and the additional clauses, which apply when the system 

--- Document Chunk 24578 ---
version of some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a 

--- Document Chunk 24579 ---
version number older than the last one introduced.

6.5.1 Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1 

--- Document Chunk 24619 ---
6.5.1.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 24620 ---
6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still 

--- Document Chunk 24621 ---
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this release 

--- Document Chunk 24622 ---
of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 24623 ---
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 24624 ---
be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0 and 1.1. 

--- Document Chunk 24625 ---
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 24626 ---
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use for balises the following values of M_VERSION: 2.0, 

--- Document Chunk 24627 ---
2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3.0. 

--- Document Chunk 24628 ---
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area 

--- Document Chunk 24629 ---
support the system version number X = 2 or 3 and the on-board requirements related to 

--- Document Chunk 24630 ---
the trackside information marked with 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 or 3.0 are applicable regardless 

--- Document Chunk 24631 ---
of the operated version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter 

--- Document Chunk 24632 ---
operates with the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC). 

--- Document Chunk 24633 ---

6.6.3.4.3 Clause 3.18.4.5.4.1 shall be replaced with: “Exception: if the train running number has 

--- Document Chunk 27344 ---
been received from the RBC, the Train Data shall not be sent back to the RBC by the 

--- Document Chunk 27345 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 27346 ---
6.6.3.4.3.1 Requirements A33 and A34 in table 5.4.3.2 shall be replaced with: 

--- Document Chunk 27347 ---
A33 The “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to a “valid train position referred

--- Document Chunk 27349 ---
If already stored on-board, valid Train Data shall be transmitted to the RBC immediately 

--- Document Chunk 27350 ---
after the “SoM position report” message. 

--- Document Chunk 27351 ---
This condition leads to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 27352 ---
A34 If the train position data stored in the on-board equipment is of status “invalid” and refers 

--- Document Chunk 27353 ---
to an LRBG, the “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to an “invalid train 

--- Document Chunk 27354 ---
position referred to an LRBG”, shall be transmitted to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 27355 ---
Otherwise the "SoM position report" message, marked as referring to "no train position 

--- Document Chunk 27356 ---
referred to an LRBG” and with the LRBG identity set to "unknown", shall be transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 27357 ---
to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 27358 ---
In both cases valid Train Data, if already stored on-board, shall be transmitted to the 

--- Document Chunk 27359 ---
RBC immediately after the “SoM position report” message. 

--- Document Chunk 27360 ---
The process shall then go to D33 

--- Document Chunk 27361 ---
6.6.3.4.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall elaborate the information to be transmitted

6.6.5.5.4 Requirements A33&A34 in table 5.4.3.2 shall be replaced with: 

--- Document Chunk 27919 ---
A33 The “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to a “valid train position referred

--- Document Chunk 27921 ---
Train running number, if already stored on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 27922 ---
This condition leads to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 27923 ---
A34 If the train position data stored in the on-board equipment is of status “invalid” and refers 

--- Document Chunk 27924 ---
to an LRBG, the “SoM position report” message, marked as referring to an “invalid train 

--- Document Chunk 27925 ---

Otherwise the "SoM position report" message, marked as referring to "no train position

referred to an LRBG” and with the LRBG identity set to "unknown", shall be transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 27928 ---
to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 27929 ---
In both cases valid Train Data and/or valid Train running number, if already stored on-

--- Document Chunk 27930 ---
board, shall be included in the “SoM position report” message.

7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language 

--- Document Chunk 28514 ---
7.3.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 28515 ---
7.3.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise 

--- Document Chunk 28516 ---
and loop airgaps. 

--- Document Chunk 28517 ---
7.3.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams 

--- Document Chunk 28518 ---
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages are 

--- Document Chunk 28519 ---
described in chapter 8). 

--- Document Chunk 28520 ---
7.3.1.3 Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these 

--- Document Chunk 28521 ---
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised 

--- Document Chunk 28522 ---
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, depending 

--- Document Chunk 28523 ---
on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values included in this 

--- Document Chunk 28524 ---
document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior verification of 

--- Document Chunk 28525 ---
their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details. 

--- Document Chunk 28526 ---
7.3.2 Definition of Variables 

--- Document Chunk 28527 ---
7.3.2.1 Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor units. 

--- Document Chunk 28528 ---
The whole variable has one type (meaning). 

--- Document Chunk 28529 ---
7.3.2.2 Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the variable. 

--- Document Chunk 28530 ---
7.3.2.3 Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.g. 32767 = “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 28531 ---
7.3.2.4 Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range 

--- Document Chunk 28532 ---
7.3.2.5 Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as 

--- Document Chunk 28533 ---
described i n the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different 

--- Document Chunk 28534 ---
names. 

--- Document Chunk 28535 ---
7.3.2.6 All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are used, 

--- Document Chunk 28536 ---
if used in more than one media. 

--- Document Chunk 28537 ---
7.3.2.7 Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement. 

--- Document Chunk 28538 ---
7.3.2.8 One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true. 

--- Document Chunk 28539 ---
7.3.2.9 Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where 

--- Document Chunk 28540 ---
justified. 

--- Document Chunk 28541 ---
7.3.2.10 When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall be 

--- Document Chunk 28542 ---
transmitted first. 

--- Document Chunk 28543 ---
7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes: 

--- Document Chunk 28544 ---
A_ Acceleration 

--- Document Chunk 28545 ---
D_ distance

7.3.3 Definition of Packets 

--- Document Chunk 28567 ---
7.3.3.1 Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal structure. 

--- Document Chunk 28568 ---
7.3.3.2 This structure consists of a packet header with: 

--- Document Chunk 28569 ---
• Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the 

--- Document Chunk 28570 ---
orientation information, optionally the scale for distance/length information and an 

--- Document Chunk 28571 ---
information section containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as 

--- Document Chunk 28572 ---
follows: 

--- Document Chunk 28573 ---
Number NID_PACKET Packet identifier 

--- Document Chunk 28574 ---
Direction Q_DIR Specifies the validity direction of 

--- Document Chunk 28575 ---
transmitted data 

--- Document Chunk 28576 ---
Length L_PACKET  Number of bits in the packet 

--- Document Chunk 28577 ---
Scale Q_SCALE Specifies which scale is used for 

--- Document Chunk 28578 ---
distance/length information 

--- Document Chunk 28579 ---
within the packet. 

--- Document Chunk 28580 ---
There is no Q_SCALE variable 

--- Document Chunk 28581 ---
in packets which do not contain 

--- Document Chunk 28582 ---
distance information. 

--- Document Chunk 28583 ---
Information ...... Well defined set(s) of variables. 

--- Document Chunk 28584 ---
• Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally 

--- Document Chunk 28585 ---
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables. 

--- Document Chunk 28586 ---
The packet structure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 28587 ---
Number NID_PACKET Packet identifier 

--- Document Chunk 28588 ---
Length L_PACKET  Number of bits in the packet 

--- Document Chunk 28589 ---
Scale Q_SCALE Specifies which scale is used for 

--- Document Chunk 28590 ---
distance/length information 

--- Document Chunk 28591 ---
within the packet. 

--- Document Chunk 28592 ---
There is no Q_SCALE variable 

--- Document Chunk 28593 ---
in packets which do not contain 

--- Document Chunk 28594 ---
distance information.

--- Document Chunk 28617 ---
7.3.3.7 If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow. 

--- Document Chunk 28618 ---
7.3.3.8 Two or more nested levels of iterations can exist. 

--- Document Chunk 28619 ---
7.3.3.9 If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a vari able is 

--- Document Chunk 28620 ---
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition 

--- Document Chunk 28621 ---
7.3.3.10 Row “Transmitted by” in the description of a packet specifies which ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 28622 ---
trackside device (balise, loop, RIU, RBC) can transmit this packet. “Any” means that the 

--- Document Chunk 28623 ---
packet can be transmitted by a balise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 28624 ---
7.3.3.10.1 Row “Transmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which ERTMS/ETCS

8.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 32918 ---
8.3.1 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 32919 ---
8.3.1.1 This chapter defines the format and content of  messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 32920 ---
functions. 

--- Document Chunk 32921 ---
8.3.1.2 Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such as 

--- Document Chunk 32922 ---
medium-specific use constraints (e .g. distance between track -circuit and balise…), as 

--- Document Chunk 32923 ---
well as functions (e.g. detection of balise reference, time and location stamp, identifying 

--- Document Chunk 32924 ---
type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio connection…) 

--- Document Chunk 32925 ---
and performance of the transmission media. 

--- Document Chunk 32926 ---
8.3.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 32927 ---
8.3.2.1 Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETC S transmission 

--- Document Chunk 32928 ---
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop). 

--- Document Chunk 32929 ---
8.3.2.2 A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 32930 ---
transmission medium). 

--- Document Chunk 32931 ---
8.3.2.3 A Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is 

--- Document Chunk 32932 ---
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram 

--- Document Chunk 32933 ---
from balise number 1 first), each telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A Eurobalise 

--- Document Chunk 32934 ---
telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of Packets.

8.4 Rules 

--- Document Chunk 32979 ---
8.4.1 Common Rules 

--- Document Chunk 32980 ---
8.4.1.1 A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) is composed of 

--- Document Chunk 32981 ---
1. One Header, 

--- Document Chunk 32982 ---
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio), 

--- Document Chunk 32983 ---
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio), 

--- Document Chunk 32984 ---
4. Optional Packets as needed by application. 

--- Document Chunk 32985 ---
8.4.1.2 The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message 

--- Document Chunk 32986 ---
format (from top to bottom). 

--- Document Chunk 32987 ---
8.4.1.3 The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given by 

--- Document Chunk 32988 ---
the message. 

--- Document Chunk 32989 ---
8.4.1.3.1 Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 

--- Document Chunk 32990 ---
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such packet. 

--- Document Chunk 32991 ---
8.4.1.3.2 Note: orientations are in any case always refe rred to the directionality of balise group 

--- Document Chunk 32992 ---
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of 

--- Document Chunk 32993 ---
LRBG (radio transmission). 

--- Document Chunk 32994 ---
8.4.1.4 A track-to-train message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type for 

--- Document Chunk 32995 ---
the same direction. 

--- Document Chunk 32996 ---
8.4.1.4.1 Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 

--- Document Chunk 32997 ---
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system). 

--- Document Chunk 32998 ---
8.4.1.4.2 Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed Restriction). 

--- Document Chunk 32999 ---
In case of  revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary speed 

--- Document Chunk 33000 ---
restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 33001 ---
8.4.1.4.3 Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The 

--- Document Chunk 33002 ---
identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions ( variable NID_TSR) 

--- Document Chunk 33003 ---
transmitted in the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 33004 ---
8.4.1.4.4 Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per 

--- Document Chunk 33005 ---
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is to 

--- Document Chunk 33006 ---
be considered as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a balise 

--- Document Chunk 33007 ---
group shall have identical content per direction. 

--- Document Chunk 33008 ---
8.4.1.4.5 Exception 5: A message can contain several packets 88 (Level Crossing information). 

--- Document Chunk 33009 ---
The identities of the corresponding Level Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in the 

--- Document Chunk 33010 ---
same message shall be different.

8.4.1.4.6 Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254 

--- Document Chunk 33022 ---
(default balise, loop or RIU information). 

--- Document Chunk 33023 ---
8.4.1.4.7 Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 145 

--- Document Chunk 33024 ---
(Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction). 

--- Document Chunk 33025 ---
8.4.1.4.8 Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0 

--- Document Chunk 33026 ---
(Virtual Balise Cover marker). 

--- Document Chunk 33027 ---
8.4.1.4.9 Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6 

--- Document Chunk 33028 ---
(Virtual Balise Cover order). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C) 

--- Document Chunk 33029 ---
of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 33030 ---
8.4.1.5 A train-to-track message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type. 

--- Document Chunk 33031 ---
8.4.1.5.1 Exception: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 

--- Document Chunk 33032 ---
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system). 

--- Document Chunk 33033 ---
8.4.1.6 Note: For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4, when the same packet is transmitted by 

--- Document Chunk 33034 ---
duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within the 

--- Document Chunk 33035 ---
message. Justification: The on -board equipment will only use one of these duplicat ed 

--- Document Chunk 33036 ---
telegrams (and therefore only one set of duplicated packets) to compose the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 33037 ---
message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2).

8.4.2 Rules for Eurobalise telegrams 

--- Document Chunk 33049 ---
8.4.2.1 The format of the telegram to be transmitted by each balise is as follows:  

--- Document Chunk 33050 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 33051 ---
General Format of Balise Telegram 

--- Document Chunk 33052 ---
Field No. VARIABLE Length ( bits) Remarks 

--- Document Chunk 33053 ---

--- Document Chunk 33058 ---
4  N_PIG 3 Position in the group. Defines the position of the balise in the 

--- Document Chunk 33059 ---
balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 33060 ---
5 N_TOTAL 3 Total number of balises in the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 33061 ---
6 M_DUP 2 Used to indicate whether the information of the balise is a 

--- Document Chunk 33062 ---
duplicate of the balise before or after this one. 

--- Document Chunk 33063 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 33064 ---
7 M_MCOUNT 8 Message counter (M_MCOUNT) - 8 bits. To enable detection 

--- Document Chunk 33065 ---
of a change of balise group message during passage of the 

--- Document Chunk 33066 ---
balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 33067 ---
8 NID_C 10 Country or region. 

--- Document Chunk 33068 ---

--- Document Chunk 33069 ---
10 Q_LINK 1 Marks the balise group as linked (Q_LINK = 1) or unlinked 

--- Document Chunk 33070 ---
(Q_LINK = 0) 

--- Document Chunk 33071 ---

Number of bits in balise header: 50 

--- Document Chunk 33079 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 33080 ---
8.4.2.2 The user information transmitted by a balise shall contain complete packets, i.e. splitting 

--- Document Chunk 33081 ---
a packet between two balises is forbidden. 

--- Document Chunk 33082 ---
8.4.2.3 When used, the packet 0 shall be transmitted as the first packet of the telegram (i.e. it is 

--- Document Chunk 33083 ---
appended to the header). 

--- Document Chunk 33084 ---
8.4.2.4 Note: If there is an active VBC stored on -board and in order to find a VBC marker, the 

--- Document Chunk 33085 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment needs first to check M_VERSION: 

--- Document Chunk 33086 ---
• If M_VERSION = 0.Y, the telegram will be ignored; 

--- Document Chunk 33087 ---
• If M_VERSION = 1.0, there will be no VBC marker; 

--- Document Chunk 33088 ---
• If M_VERSION = 1.1, the on-board must look for a packet 200 (see chapter 6); 

--- Document Chunk 33089 ---
• In all other cases (including when M_VERSION is higher than the highest sy stem 

--- Document Chunk 33090 ---
version supported by the on-board), the on-board must look for a packet 0.

If a packet 0 or 200 is found, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment must also check 

--- Document Chunk 33102 ---
whether NID_C matches the VBC marker included in the packet 0 or 200. This implies 

--- Document Chunk 33103 ---
that in all future system versions the size and location of M_VERSION and NID_C inside 

--- Document Chunk 33104 ---
the header, the overall size of the header and the position/content of the packet 0

9.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 34300 ---
9.3.1 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 34301 ---
9.3.1.1 Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of 

--- Document Chunk 34302 ---
the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 34303 ---
9.3.1.2 The purpose of this chapter is to ease the assessment of the compliance of an 

--- Document Chunk 34304 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment with the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 34305 ---
9.3.1.3 To that effect , this chapter comprehensively identifies which clauses contain 

--- Document Chunk 34306 ---
requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and conversely which 

--- Document Chunk 34307 ---
ones do not, either because they contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 34308 ---
trackside only or because they are of another type. 

--- Document Chunk 34309 ---
9.3.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 34310 ---
9.3.2.1 The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause: 

--- Document Chunk 34311 ---
a) ERTMS/ETCS on-board requirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that must 

--- Document Chunk 34312 ---
be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 34313 ---
b) ERTMS/ETCS trackside requirement: a clause containing requirement(s) that must 

--- Document Chunk 34314 ---
be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS trackside, in case the corresponding 

--- Document Chunk 34315 ---
function is implemented 

--- Document Chunk 34316 ---
c) Definition: a c lause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of 

--- Document Chunk 34317 ---
requirement(s) or without which requirement(s) cannot be unambiguously interpreted 

--- Document Chunk 34318 ---
d) Informative: a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the 

--- Document Chunk 34319 ---
justification of requirement(s) 

--- Document Chunk 34320 ---
e) Others: a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories 

--- Document Chunk 34321 ---
9.3.2.2 Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword 

--- Document Chunk 34322 ---
“shall”. However: 

--- Document Chunk 34323 ---
a) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on 

--- Document Chunk 34324 ---
the accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 34325 ---
and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”. 

--- Document Chunk 34326 ---
b) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables, 

--- Document Chunk 34327 ---
see chapters 7 and 8) are also described with tables. The numbered titles (i.e. the
