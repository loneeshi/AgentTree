Back to basics: Operator interfaces

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
This article in the ‘Back to basics’ series 

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
covers the subject of the interface between 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
the signalling system and a human operator 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
in a signalbox or control centre. The 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
technology of these systems varies from 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
mechanical levers and control panels 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
with switches or buttons to computer 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
workstations, but they all provide controls, 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
which enable the operator to manage train 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
movements and indications, which provide 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
the operator with information about the 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
status of the signalling equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
position of trains.

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
As with other ‘back to basics’ articles, the intention 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
is to provide an overview for IRSE members new 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
to the industry who do not have experience of 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
working in this specific area. The aim is to describe 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
the systems in a generic manner, but using 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
examples based mainly on UK main line railway 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
practice. The scope is limited to the core signalling 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
functions and excludes voice communications, 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
which is of course also a key element of any 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
operator interface.

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
Evolution of the interface

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
In the mechanical signalling era, the operator 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
interface and the interlocking were combined, 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
the controls were levers above the ﬂoor of 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
the signalbox that directly interacted with the 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
mechanical interlocking in the locking room 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
below, and via rods and wires to the points and 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
signals on the railway outside. 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
Example of a mechanical 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
lever frame. Note the 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
indicators on the front of 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
the shelf over the levers, 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
showing the status of 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
points and signals.

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
In the early days there were no indications 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
provided – the position of the levers provided 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
feedback of the state of the points and signals and 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
big windows gave good visibility of passing trains. 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
A signalbox diagram showing the track layout and 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
location of signals was provided, but this simply 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
provided static information such as lever numbers 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
for each point and signal.

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
The first indications were electro-magnetic 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
devices where the position of a needle repeated 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
the position of the semaphore arm of a signal that 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
was out of sight from the signalbox. These devices 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
are typically mounted on the ‘block shelf’ above 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
the levers for the signals to which they apply. In 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
later years the electro-magnetic indicators were 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
superseded by modules with coloured lamps. 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
These came to be applied more widely when lever 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
frames were used to electrically control colour 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
light signals and power operated points and the 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
direct connection between lever position and the 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
outside equipment was lost.

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
When track circuits were introduced on an 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
intermittent basis, similar indicators were provided 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
on the block shelf to show the track sections 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
occupied by trains, but when track circuiting 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
became more widespread, a better visualisation 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
of train location came to be provided by lamps on 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
the signalbox diagram.

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
The final elements of the operator interface 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
in a mechanical signalbox are the block 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
instruments that communicate with neighbouring 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
signalboxes. In the early days they were purely a 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
communication system, by which the operators 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
offered and accepted trains over the block section 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
between the signalboxes, and the indications 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
provided the operator with a reminder of whether 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
the section was clear or occupied by a train. 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
In later years they became true controls as an 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
electrical interlocking prevented the starting signal 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
lever being operated until the block instrument 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
indicated ‘line clear’.

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
An inherent feature of a mechanical interface is 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
that when routing a train through the control area, 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
the operator has to first individually move and 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
lock all the points along the route, then operate 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
the signals to give the correct proceed aspects 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
to the train, and finally replace each signal to its 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
most restrictive aspect after the train has passed. 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
In a complex area, this will require several lever 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
operations for every train, with a significant 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
amount of physical effort where the points and 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
signals are mechanically operated.

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
Control panels 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
Some early relay interlockings retained the 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
traditional lever interface, with rows of miniature 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
signalling levers on a desk, but the same result 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
can be achieved equally well using standard 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
industrial switches mounted on a control panel. 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
These can be arranged in rows as in a lever 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
frame, or on a schematic track diagram so that 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
each switch is adjacent to the representation of 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
the point or signal it controls. This is known as 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
an individual function switch (IFS) panel, as each 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
switch controls one point or signal, with the 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
operator making the required sequence of switch 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
operations to set the route for a train. 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
A further evolution of the control interface 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
came with the introduction of ‘route setting’ 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
interlockings, as described in an earlier ‘back to 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
basics’ article. The first examples of this were one 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
control switch (OCS) panels on which an individual 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
switch or button was provided to set and cancel 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
each route within the interlocking. This was further 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
refined into the entrance exit (NX) panel, where 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
setting a route is achieved by operating switches 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
or buttons at both entrance and exit of a route on 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
the schematic track diagram. This provided a very 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
intuitive and easy to operate interface and became 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
the standard method of operation from the 1950s 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
onwards. Points on these panels are provided 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
with three-position switches – the centre position 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
allowing the points to move as required for route 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
setting, and the left and right positions locking the 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
points in the normal or reverse positions.

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
The indications provided to the operator also 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
evolved to provide information on the status of 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
the route locking logic within the interlocking. This 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
is typically a row of white lights on the schematic 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
track diagram to show the path over each train 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
detection section for which a route has been

locked. The progress of a train then appears as 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
the white route lights changing to red in sequence 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
along the route.

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
The NX controls and indications can either 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
be combined on a single panel, or split with 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
controls on a desk immediately in front of the 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
operator and indications on a separate panel 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
(often wall mounted) behind the desk – the latter 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
arrangement is more common for large control 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
centres with multiple operators.

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
Computer workstations

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
The operator interface in a modern control 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
centre is now usually a computer workstation, 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
with multiple screens to display a schematic 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
track diagram of the railway under control. The 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
indications of signalling equipment status, route 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
setting and track occupation are provided by 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
colour coding of the symbols on the schematic 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
track diagram, following the conventions that 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
were originally established for lights on panels. 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
The operator interacts with the system via a 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
computer keyboard and a mouse or trackerball, 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
with a mode of operation mimicking an OCS 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
or NX panel, e.g. click on route entrance 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
symbol and select a route from a drop down 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
list, or click on entrance symbol and then exit 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
symbol in sequence.

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
One significant difference between computer 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
workstations and the older technologies is in the 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
method by which an operator applies a ‘reminder’ 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
to prevent themselves from operating a control; 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
for instance to prevent points being moved when 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
maintenance is being undertaken. With levers or 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
a panel, the reminder is simply a physical device 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
that the operator attaches to the control that 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
prevents it being operated – a collar on a lever, 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
or a cap over a button or switch. On a computer 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
workstation, the reminder is a software function 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
that needs to be designed into the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
system. A reminder is displayed on the workstation 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
screen as highlighting of the symbol for the 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
signalling object to which it applies, and the 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
interlocking must reject any attempt to operate a 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
control with a reminder applied (this check may 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
be within the computer workstation interface 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
where an older interlocking without this facility 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
is recontrolled).

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
The number of screens is determined by the size 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
and complexity of the area under control. It is 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
usually a requirement that an overview of the 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
whole of the controlled area must be visible at any 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
time, and this is sometimes achieved on an upper 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
row of screens displaying fixed areas, while the 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
operator interacts with a lower row of screens on 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
the desk where a selected area can be displayed in 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
more detail, and to view the status of alarms and 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
other information from the system.

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
The overview displays may be shared between 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
multiple workstations – sometimes this is a very 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
large wall mounted display covering the whole 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
control centre area. This may be provided mainly 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
for the benefit of managers or other staff in 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
the room; an alternative to this is a ‘supervisors 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
workstation’ where any of the signalling screens 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
can be selected to be displayed on a ‘view only’ 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
basis. Some control centres now cover very large 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
areas, with tens of workstations controlling several 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
hundred route kilometres of railway.

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
Computer workstations often provide additional 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
functionality beyond the standard controls and 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
indications, such as automatic route setting (ARS) 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
or overrun management. Some of these are 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
described later in the article.

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
Technology and safety

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
In the mechanical and early relay interlocking era, 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
the technology for the operator interface was 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
simply a direct mechanical or electrical interface 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
between levers, switches, lamps and relays. The 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
concept of the signalling control system as a 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
separate entity from the interlocking appeared 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
Example of a first 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
generation computer 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
workstation with screens 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
and a trackerball. This 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
is the workstation 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
controlling Liverpool 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
Street terminus in London 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
at the first Integrated 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
Electronic Control Centre 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
(IECC) commissioned by 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
British Rail in 1989 – still 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
in service in 2020 but due 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
to be upgraded in the 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
near future.

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
“The operator 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
interface in 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
a modern 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
control centre 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
is now usually 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
a computer

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
when remote control systems were introduced 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
to allow a large control centre to interface with 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
multiple interlockings over telecommunications 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
links. A remote control system comprises an 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
‘office end’ that connects to the controls and 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
indications on the panel at the control centre, 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
and a ‘field end’ that connects to relay coils 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
and contacts in the interlocking. The office 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
and field ends communicate with one another 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
via a telecommunications link, so that every 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
operation of a control on the panel energises the 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
corresponding relay in the interlocking, and a relay 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
contact closure in the interlocking illuminates a 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
lamp on the panel. The most common form of 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
remote control is ‘time division multiplex’ (TDM) 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
where the signalling states are coded into a digital 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
message, which can be sent through a standard 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
serial interface via a modem. TDM hardware 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
typically comprises a rack of electronics, with a 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
master processor card and a variable number of 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
input and output cards to match the number of 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
controls and indications required.

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
With some types of relay interlockings, there is a 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
split between the ‘vital’ logic in the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
itself, and ‘non-vital’ logic at the operator 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
interface. Examples of non-vital logic are 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
translating push button sequences into a route 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
request, or the logic to extinguish a white route 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
lamp when the corresponding red track circuit 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
lamp is lit. These are considered non vital because 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
the impact of a failure of the remote control 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
system that generates an incorrect control to 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
the interlocking is the same as a human error in 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
operating this control, and should be protected 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
by the interlocking logic. Similarly, an incorrect 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
indication can only result in a hazard if it misleads 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
the operator to undertake an unsafe action. The 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
non vital logic was implemented in smaller and 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
cheaper ‘post office’ relays or in an electronic 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
‘panel processor’. Modern microprocessor based 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
TDMs can now incorporate this sort of logic in 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
either the office or field end equipment.

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
With the move to electronic interlockings and 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
computer workstations, the same considerations 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
apply, but the safety analysis has become more 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
sophisticated with the arrival of CENELEC 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
standards and the concept of safety integrity 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
levels (SIL). It is now recognised that an operator 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
interface failure in combination with human 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
error could lead to an accident in abnormal 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
working situations and so some of the functions 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
of an operator interface are categorised as SIL 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
2 (interlockings are in the highest integrity level 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
SIL 4, and non-safety functions are SIL 0).

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
Where an operator interface function needs to 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
achieve a particularly high safety integrity level, 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
one approach is to require a sequence of controls 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
to be sent to the interlocking, which will only 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
accept them if they are consistent and received 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
within a limited time window. An example of this is 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
an axle counter restoration control, which requires 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
the operator to undertake two different actions 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
(e.g. clicking on a symbol and entering a track 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
section name), which generate separate messages 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
from the interface to the interlocking. This process 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
provides protection against human error by the 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
operator and spurious messages generated as a 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
result of a fault in the interface.

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
The hardware and software architecture for a 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
computer workstation is generally based on 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
commercial off the shelf (COTS) computing 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
components, engineered into a system that will 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
achieve the necessary SIL and availability targets. 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
Except for the smallest installations, this will 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
imply duplication of all the critical components 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
and data links to avoid single points of failure. 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
The architecture varies between suppliers, but 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
in recent years there has been a trend towards 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
a ‘client/server’ approach that decouples the

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
interfaces to the interlockings and the area-wide 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
functions such as automatic route setting and 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
train describer (see below) from the operator 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
interfaces. This allows the areas controlled by the 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
workstations to be dynamically reconfigured, for 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
instance to reduce the number of workstations 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
that need to be staffed in quiet periods. A further 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
extension of this concept is to allow dynamic 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
reconfiguration between control centres – for 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
instance to provide a backup disaster recovery 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
facility to maintain train operations when the 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
primary control centre building has to be 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
evacuated as a result of a terrorist attack or a 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
natural disaster.

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
Train describer

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
The track occupation indications on a panel 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
or workstation show where there are trains in 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
the controlled area, but the operator (or ARS) 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
also needs to know the identity of each train so 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
that it can be routed correctly. Each train will 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
be allocated a number or alphanumeric code 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
(sometimes called a ‘headcode’) and these are 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
displayed to the operator by a system known as 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
a ‘train describer’. Train describers were one of 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
the earliest applications of computer technology 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
in signalling, and with a control panel the train 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
describer is a dedicated processor interfaced 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
to small alphanumeric displays set into the 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
indications panel, or a separate computer screen. 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
On a computer workstation the train describer is 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
simply a software function within the system, with 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
the train numbers displayed at the appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
locations on the main screens. In either case a 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
user interface to the train describer is required to 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
allow an operator to enter (sometimes referred to 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
as ‘interposing’), delete and amend train numbers 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
or enter other codes such as line blocked.

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
As conventional lineside signalling does not 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
provide a data path for a train to report its identity 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
to the control centre, the train describer requires 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
the train number to be entered manually by an 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
operator or automatically from the timetable 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
at the start of the train’s journey, and it then 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
tracks the train through the controlled area by 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
monitoring the sequence of route setting and 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
track section occupation. The train describer logic 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
is based on the concept that trains move between 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
‘berths’ – when a train is in the berth associated 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
with a signal, it means this is the next signal it will 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
encounter in its journey. Additional berths are 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
provided at locations where trains may reverse, or 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
where permissive working allows more than one 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
train in a section. 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
When a train passes from one control area to 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
another, the train number is transmitted as a data 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
message between the train describers for the two 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
areas. Similar data messages reporting every train 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
step are also sent from each train describer to a 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
national train running information system, which 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
provides the data source for real time customer 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
and staff information displays, automated public 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
address announcements, and recording systems 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
for performance monitoring.

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
Alarms and overrun management

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
Whatever the technology, the interface will 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
provide a number of alerts and alarms. Some 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
of these relate to equipment failures, and 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
others to events that the operator needs to 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
be aware of. A typical example will be a train 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
describer alarm when a track section becomes 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
unexpectedly occupied. 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
A specific alarm for signal passed at danger (SPAD) 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
was introduced in the UK as a result of the public 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
inquiry recommendations following the Ladbroke 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
Grove accident in 1999. When a track section 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
occupation sequence occurs at a red signal which 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
may be as a result of a SPAD, a distinctive (and 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
loud) alarm sounds and the area of overrun at the 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
signal is highlighted on the workstation screens.

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
On some recent installations with computer 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
workstations this facility has been further 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
enhanced with an automated response to the 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
SPAD event to stop other trains in the area. The 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
processor in the interface system sends requests 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
to the interlocking to replace other signals on the 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
approach to the SPAD area. This is known as a 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
‘predefined operational protection’ (POP) control. 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
Providing this capability in the SIL 2 interface 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
system can allow simplification of logic in the SIL 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
4 interlocking.

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
Automatic Route Setting

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
Modern control centres with computer 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
workstations often include an automatic route 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
setting (ARS) facility. This reduces the operator 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
workload linked to routine train movements, 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
allowing them to focus on problem areas and 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
tasks that require voice communications with staff 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
and the public.

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
ARS is usually a separate processor within the 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
operator interface system that monitors the 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
movement of trains as reported by the train 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
describer, and uses an electronic version of the 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
timetable for the day to identify which routes 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
should be set to allow each train to run through 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
the controlled area on its planned path and 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
timings. Where possible the objective is to set 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
routes sufficiently far ahead of the train so the 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
driver always sees green signals, although there 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
are exceptions to this, e.g. where departure from 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
a station needs to wait for a ‘train ready to start’ 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
message from platform staff.

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
An important principle is that ARS should not 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
‘challenge’ the interlocking by requesting a route 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
that is not available to be set. This requires the ARS 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
to be programmed with a copy of the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
route availability logic and to monitor the 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
signalling states such as track occupancy, route 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
locking and reminders.

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
When trains are running late, it is very likely that 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
conﬂ icts will arise where two trains require to 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
run over the same section of track at the same 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
time. This can arise when routes converge or 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
cross, and at crossing points on single lines (see 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
the article by John Francis in the June 2020 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
IRSE News for some examples). ARS requires an 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
“The operator 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
also needs to 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
know the identity 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
of each train”

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
“Modern control 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
centres with 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
computer 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
workstations 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
often include an 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
automatic route 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
setting facility”

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
algorithm to decide which train to give priority in 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
these circumstances – this might be to keep the 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
trains in timetable order, ‘first come first served’ 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
or a comparison of the predicted train delays for 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
the alternative options. At the design stage for a 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
new installation, workshops with operators who 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
are experienced with the train service in the area 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
are a valuable source of information to tailor the 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
algorithms for each potential area of conﬂ ict.

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
The operator retains the capability to set routes 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
manually at any time, and where this is necessary 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
the operator can switch off ARS for an individual 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
train, or for an ‘ARS sub-area’, typically a single 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
junction or running line between stations. ARS 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
sub-areas will also be automatically switched 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
off if an operator cancels a route that has been 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
set by ARS, a SPAD is detected, or a signal group 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
replacement control is operated.

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
Traffic management

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
Traditionally the timetable used by ARS was 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
updated on a daily basis from the national train 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
planning systems. Since ARS can only set routes 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
for trains according to the timetable, additional 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
trains and those required to deviate from the 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
timetable have to be routed manually by the 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
operator. This can be avoided if ARS can be 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
provided with a dynamic timetable, updated 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
throughout the day with changes to the plan. This 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
is the concept behind ‘traffic management’ which 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
aims to move away from operators making train 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
routing decisions in real time, to a process where 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
issues are identified well in advance, and solutions 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
are identified and incorporated into the dynamic 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
timetable so that all trains can be routed by ARS.

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
Traffic management systems are another layer of 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
functionality that sit above the primary operator 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
interfaces described in this article. The interface 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
with the signalling is via timetable updates to ARS, 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
so there is minimal safety impact (i.e. SIL 0). They 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
may also be used by operators who have strategic 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
responsibility for a whole route, a ‘controller’ or 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
‘despatcher’ rather than a ‘signaller’. The user 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
interface is usually in the form of a train graph or 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
a platform occupation chart, which shows the 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
planned, actual and predicted movement of each 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
train and highlights trains that are deviating from 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
the plan and the consequential conﬂ icts with 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
other trains and with planned line blockages. Edit 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
facilities allow trains to be rescheduled, rerouted 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
or cancelled, and additional trains to be inserted 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
into the timetable. There may also be a ‘what if’ 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
facility to allow an operator to try out alternative 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
options for rescheduling, evaluate the impact on 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
train delays and other key performance indicators 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
for the train service, and then deploy the chosen 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
option into the dynamic timetable.

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
Train protection and ERTMS/ETCS

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
Train protection systems overlaid onto 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
conventional lineside signalling using track 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
mounted equipment to communicate with the 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
train (e.g. TPWS in the UK) have little impact on 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
the operator interface, other than perhaps an 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
indication to warn of equipment failure.

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
ETCS level 2 introduces a communication link 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
between the train and a radio block centre (RBC), 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
and this may require an operator interface, 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
to provide information on the ETCS mode of 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
operation of each train, and to allow updating of 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
temporary speed restrictions. In early applications 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
these functions have not been integrated into the 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
primary operator interface system (which is only 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
linked to the interlocking), and a separate stand 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
alone terminal from the ETCS supplier provides an 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
operator interface to the RBC. As ETCS becomes 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
more widespread, more integrated solutions are 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
likely to evolve.

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
Metros

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
On modern metros with CBTC signalling, 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
the system architecture generally includes a 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
component known as ‘automatic train supervision’ 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
(ATS), and this incorporates the operator interface, 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
including automatic route setting and traffic 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
management functions. ATS interfaces with 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
automatic train operation (ATO) so that decisions 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
made in the control centre can directly inﬂ uence 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
movement of trains without involvement of 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
a human driver. 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
For most metros the key parameter being 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
managed is not the adherence to the timetable, 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
but the regularity of trains, and the operator 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
interface allows this to be monitored and 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
managed. If two trains are running close together, 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
ATS can delay the departure of the second train 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
from a station to even out the gaps in the service, 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
or instruct the ATO to run at reduced speeds 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
between stations to save energy. 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
Integration of systems

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
This article has described the operator interface 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
for the core signalling functions, but in a modern 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
control centre the person at a control panel or 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
computer workstation will also have to interact 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
with a number of other systems. Examples of 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
this can include voice communications with train 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
drivers and track workers, closed circuit television 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
(CCTV) monitoring of level crossings and stations, 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
monitoring systems for vehicle or infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
faults, passenger and staff information systems, 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
systems for electric traction power supply, and 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
even corporate information technology (IT) 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
applications such as emails and timesheets.

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
Traditionally there has been little integration of 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
the operator interfaces for these systems – a 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
typical computer workstation will have a separate 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
terminal on the desk for voice communications, 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
an office type personal computer for the 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
corporate IT network, and dedicated screens 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
for CCTV monitoring. The technology exists 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
to integrate all of these into a single interface, 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
but there are practical, commercial and safety 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
assurance obstacles to integrating systems from 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
different suppliers when there are no standard 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
interface specifications, and differing system 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
architectures, SIL requirements and system 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
lifecycles. An integrated solution is most likely to 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
be seen on a turnkey project to build a new metro 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
or high speed line.

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
“Traditionally 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
the timetable

used by ARS was

updated on a

daily basis from 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
the national 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---

systems”

The train graph (above) represents each train as a line on

the graph, the X axis is time and Y axis is distance along 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
the route (Paddington to Reading). The violet vertical 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
bar is the current time with actual train movements 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
to the left and predicted movement to the right. The 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
‘platform docker’ (below) shows platform occupancy 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
at a passenger station (Slough). The X axis is again time, 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
and each platform is represented by a horizontal row 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
with rectangles representing each train and the time it 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
occupies the platform. In this case the trains are colour 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
coded to highlight whether they are running on time or 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
late. The panel to the right on each screen gives statistics 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
relevant to key performance indicators for the train service 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
performance and identifies trains that may incur penalties 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
for late running.

About the author ...

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
Ian Mitchell has 45 years’ experience in the rail industry, in 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
British Rail Research and its post-privatisation successor 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
companies – AEA Technology Rail, DeltaRail and Resonate. 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
He retired as professional head of signalling in 2011, but still 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
does some consultancy for his previous employers as well 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
as acting as one of editors of IRSE News and as a member 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
of the International Technical Committee. He presented a 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
Presidential Paper on the topic “Signalling Control Centres 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
Today and Tomorrow” in 2003, and is due to deliver another 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
in 2021 jointly with Nora Balfe, who is a human factors 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
specialist with Irish Rail.

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
Human factors

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
It goes without saying that an effective operator interface to 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
the signalling system must be designed with the operator in 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
mind, and human factors specialists have played an increasingly 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
important role in design of modern control centres. This starts 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
with workload analysis to determine how large an area of 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
railway can be effectively managed by an individual operator, 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
as this will determine the number of workstations and hence 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
the size of the control room. The constraining factor will 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
be determined by the level of automation in the system; for 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
instance where ARS is provided, the workload during busy 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
periods of train operations may be less than at night when the 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
operator has to manage line blockages for work on the track.

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
At a more detailed level, the size of text and symbols on 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
the screens, the number of screens and their location on 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
the desk, the height of the desk and even the type of chair 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
all need consideration to ensure the operator remains alert 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
and comfortable.

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
Conclusion

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
As with other areas of signalling technology, the evolution 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
from levers to computer mouse has been dramatic, but the 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
fundamental principles of controls and indications remain. 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
What has changed the most is the level of automation; modern 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
systems now require little human intervention when the railway 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
is running to plan, but an experienced operator and a well 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
designed human interface are still crucial in dealing with failures 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
and unexpected scenarios. 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
One of the lectures later in this year’s Presidential Programme 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
will specifically explore the issue of automation in control 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
centres – what are the strengths and weakness of existing 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
systems, what further tasks could be automated, and how 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
do we ensure the human and computer work together 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
most effectively?
