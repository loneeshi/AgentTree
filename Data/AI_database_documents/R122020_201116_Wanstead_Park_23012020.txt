Preface

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
The purpose of a Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation is to 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
improve railway safety by preventing future railway accidents or by mitigating their 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
consequences.  It is not the purpose of such an investigation to establish blame or 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
liability. Accordingly, it is inappropriate that RAIB reports should be used to assign 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
fault or blame, or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
process has been undertaken for that purpose.

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
RAIB’s findings are based on its own evaluation of the evidence that was available at 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
the time of the investigation and are intended to explain what happened, and why, in a 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
fair and unbiased manner. 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
Where RAIB has described a factor as being linked to cause and the term is 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
unqualified, this means that RAIB has satisfied itself that the evidence supports both 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
the presence of the factor and its direct relevance to the causation of the accident or 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
incident that is being investigated. However, where RAIB is less confident about the 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
existence of a factor, or its role in the causation of the accident or incident, RAIB will 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
qualify its findings by use of words such as ‘probable’ or ‘possible’, as appropriate.  

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
Where there is more than one potential explanation RAIB may describe one factor as 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
being ‘more’ or ‘less’ likely than the other.

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
In some cases factors are described as ‘underlying’. Such factors are also relevant 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
to the causation of the accident or incident but are associated with the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
management arrangements or organisational issues (such as working culture).  

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
Where necessary, words such as ‘probable’ or ‘possible’ can also be used to qualify 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
‘underlying factor’.

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
Use of the word ‘probable’ means that, although it is considered highly likely that the 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
factor applied, some small element of uncertainty remains. Use of the word ‘possible’ 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
means that, although there is some evidence that supports this factor, there remains a 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
more significant degree of uncertainty.

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
An ‘observation’ is a safety issue discovered as part of the investigation that is not 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
considered to be causal or underlying to the accident or incident being investigated, 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
but does deserve scrutiny because of a perceived potential for safety learning.  

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
The above terms are intended to assist readers’ interpretation of the report, and to 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
provide suitable explanations where uncertainty remains. The report should therefore 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
be interpreted as the view of RAIB, expressed with the sole purpose of improving 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
railway safety. 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
Any information about casualties is based on figures provided to RAIB from various 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
sources.  Considerations of personal privacy may mean that not all of the actual 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
effects of the event are recorded in the report. RAIB recognises that sudden 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
unexpected events can have both short- and long-term consequences for the physical 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
and/or mental health of people who were involved, both directly and indirectly, in what 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
happened.

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
RAIB’s investigation (including its scope, methods, conclusions and recommendations) 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
is independent of any inquest or fatal accident inquiry, and all other investigations, 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
including those carried out by the safety authority, police or railway industry.

Summary

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
Shortly before 06:00 hrs on Thursday 23 January 2020, a wagon in the rear half of 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
a heavily loaded freight train derailed on a small radius curve as it crossed a bridge 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
in east London. The forces from the train caused the rails on the bridge, which were 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
attached to large longitudinal timbers, to spread apart. Two adjacent wheelsets 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
from different wagons derailed, but one wheelset re-railed itself after travelling a 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
short distance. The other wheelset remained derailed as the train continued for 2.5 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
miles (4.1 km) before stopping, and this caused significant track damage. Wagons 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
positioned behind the derailed wagons remained on the track.

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
Track where the rails are supported on longitudinal timbers is subject to special 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
inspections by staff who have received additional training to undertake this role. 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
RAIB found that the condition of the timbers at the point of derailment had severely 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
deteriorated because of rot, but this was concealed by their superficially good exterior 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
condition. The inspection method and tools used by Network Rail staff were not 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
sufficient to detect the poor internal condition of the timber.

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
The widening of the track gauge was identified, by track recording vehicles operated 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
by Network Rail, six times between March 2019 and January 2020. On three 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
occasions, the track maintenance gangs responded but undertook work in a nearby 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
location due to erroneous GPS data. On three other occasions, the track recording 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
vehicles’ software did not report the location of the fault so maintenance staff remained 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
unaware of it.

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
One wagon in the train exerted sufficient force on the weakened track support to force 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
the rails apart and cause the wagon to derail. Examination of the first wagon to derail 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
and its maintenance records indicated that it had experienced unusually rapid wheel 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
wear over several years. It is possible that this meant it was imposing higher than 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
normal lateral forces on the track and that this is related to a defect which affected the 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
way the bogie was able to rotate.

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
Following the failure of a longitudinal timber on a bridge in the same area in August 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
2017, Network Rail launched a review resulting in an updated standard for the detailed 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
inspection and management of longitudinal timbers. The updated standard was under 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
development at the time of the accident, and was published in March 2020. 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
RAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail regarding improvements in 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
the provision of track recording vehicle data to track maintenance staff, and one 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
recommendation to the wagon owner concerning the monitoring of maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
activities to reduce the risk of defective rail vehicles entering service. It has identified 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
three learning points covering the management of longitudinal timber systems and 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
loading activities in freight loading terminals.

The accident

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
Summary of the accident 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
4 At about 05:54 hrs on Thursday 23 January 2020, two adjacent wagons, 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
positioned towards the rear of a 22-wagon freight train, became derailed between 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
Woodgrange Park and Wanstead Park in north-east London. The rear wheelset 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
of the leading of these wagons derailed with its right-hand wheel dropping to run 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
inside the right-hand rail. The derailment occurred on a curve when rail movement 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
resulted in an increase in the distance between the rails, known as gauge 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
widening or a wide gauge fault. This occurred on a bridge on which the rails were 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
supported on longitudinal timbers running continuously beneath each rail.

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
5 About seven metres beyond the initial point of derailment (POD), and at the end 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
of the bridge, the leading left-hand wheel of the following wagon derailed with 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
its left-hand wheel running inside the left-hand rail. The five following wagons 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
continued without derailing after the rails were able to move back and the gauge 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
reduced.

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
6 The derailed train continued for 4.1 km (2.5 miles), travelling at up to 35 mph 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
(56 km/h) and causing extensive damage to the track. The driver was unaware 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
of the derailment until the brake pipe between the two affected wagons 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
separated causing the train brakes to apply automatically. The train came to a 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
stand between Leyton Midland Road and Walthamstow Queens Road stations 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
(figure 1).

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
7 The railway between Woodgrange Park Junction and South Tottenham East 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
Junction was closed for repair for 27 days, reopening on 19 February 2020.

Location

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
10 The Barking to Gospel Oak (Hampstead) line runs in an arc across north-east 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
London, passing through Walthamstow and Tottenham (figure 2). Electrification of 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
the line was completed in 2018. The route now carries a local passenger service 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
every 15 minutes in each direction, and longer-distance freight trains. In the 12 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
years prior to the derailment, the route saw a 500% increase in the amount of 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
traffic, due to increased passenger services and the opening of new freight and 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
port facilities in east London and Essex (paragraph 55).

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
11 The train involved in the accident (train reporting number 6Z54) was travelling 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
west on the up Tottenham & Hampstead line. The derailment occurred as the 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
train crossed bridge TAH2/456 spanning Lorne Road, a residential road in 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
Forest Gate. The bridge is located at 11 miles 825 yards.1  It forms part of a 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
4.9 km long section of elevated railway with numerous metal bridges spanning 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
roads, interspersed with masonry arched viaducts and some short sections of

12 Bridge 456 is located at the top of a steep gradient ascended by trains travelling 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
west from Barking. The 1 in 65 (1.53%) gradient extends for 0.7 km from 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
Woodgrange Park Junction, reducing to 1 in 190 (0.52%) at bridge 456. This 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
gradient continues for 0.1 km beyond bridge 456, and the track is then level for 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
0.4 km to Wanstead Park station. Bridge 456 is located near the mid-point of a 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
0.2 km long, 400 metre radius left-hand curve (figure 3).

Organisations involved

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
13 Network Rail owns and maintains the infrastructure. It was the employer of staff 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
involved in the inspection and monitoring of the track across bridge 456. 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
14 DB Cargo was the operator of the train and employer of the train driver. It was 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
also responsible for the loading of the wagons at Barking.

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
15 VTG Rail UK Ltd was the owner of the wagons involved, and responsible for their 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
maintenance as the Entity in Charge of Maintenance.

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
16 The above freely co-operated with the investigation.

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
Train and wagons involved

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
17 Train 6Z54 formed the 05:31 hrs service from Barking Eurohub to Calvert, near 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
Aylesbury, via Acton yard. It consisted of 22 loaded JNA, KEA and JXA open 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
bogie box wagons hauled by a Class 66 diesel locomotive (number 66154). 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
Although all three types of wagon had the same capacity, JXA wagons are larger

18 Wagon 3415, the first wagon to derail, was a JNA bogie box wagon, weighing 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
27.4 tonnes tare. Its load carrying capacity was limited to 74.2 tonnes so that 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
its gross loaded weight did not exceed 101.6 tonnes, the maximum permitted 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
on Network Rail infrastructure. The wagon was fitted with Davis & Lloyd - ESC1 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
3-piece bogies, and wheels with a P6 wheel profile (figure 4).

19 On departure from Barking on 23 January 2020, the train weighed 2170 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
tonnes, excluding the locomotive, and was carrying 1435 tonnes of clay spoil. 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
It comprised a rake of wagons being used on a daily round trip from Barking to 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
Calvert, returning empty to Barking to be reloaded overnight. Wagon 3415 had 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
travelled loaded as part of the same train on the same route on nine previous 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
occasions during 2020, including on the two previous days.

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
20 At the time of derailment, the train was running at 22 mph (35 km/h) on a section 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
of line where the maximum permitted speed was 40 mph (64 km/h) and with 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
the locomotive under power as the rear part of the train was still ascending the 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
gradient. There is no indication that the handling of the train had any influence on 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
the cause of the derailment.

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
21 The second wagon to derail was wagon number 3114. This was a type JXA bogie 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
box wagon, and was positioned immediately behind wagon 3415.

Point of derailment (POD1)

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
Rail infrastructure and systems involved

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
22 The railway is double track, and is electrified with 25 kV AC overhead line. It has 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
a maximum permitted speed of 45 mph (72 km/h) in both directions, although this 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
is reduced to 40 mph (64 km/h) in the vicinity of bridge 456 due to the curvature 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
of the line. The track circuit block signalling is operated by a signaller located at 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
South Tottenham Station Junction signal box.

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
23 The track is formed of continuously welded CEN-60 flat-bottomed rails. Most of 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
the track is ballasted with rails secured to EG47 sleepers by Pandrol FastClips. 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
On bridges fitted with longitudinal timbers, rails are secured by NRS2 baseplates 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
which are attached to the timbers using angled baseplate screws (figure 5 and 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
figure 6).

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
transoms which enclose steel tie rods (figure 6). The timbers rest directly on the 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
metal bridge deck and are held in position by metal brackets known as cleats.

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
25 Supporting running rails on longitudinal timbers, rather than using conventional 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
sleepers and ballast, imposes less weight on the bridge and thereby permits 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
a lighter and shallower bridge structure. This increases the clearance for high 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
vehicles using the roads below. Although less expensive to construct, bridges 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
with longitudinal timber systems (also known as waybeams, longitudinal wheel 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
timbers, or longitudinal bearers) are vulnerable to developing track geometry 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
faults and so have increased inspection and maintenance requirements.

26 Network Rail owns over 2,500 spans where the track is supported on longitudinal 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
timbers, and has a long-term policy for replacing them with ballasted track where 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
possible. This normally requires the complete reconstruction of a bridge to take 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
heavier ballasted track. On Anglia route, there are still about 200 track spans fitted 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
with longitudinal timbers of which about 30% are softwood and the remainder 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
hardwood. A single span bridge carrying two tracks is counted as two track spans 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
in this data, and some larger structures carry one or more tracks over several 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
successive track spans. The 200 track spans represent about 4% of Anglia route’s 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
total number of underbridge spans where roads, watercourses or other features 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
pass under the railway. 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
27 Bridge 456 was constructed in 1893 using fabricated steel girders and a metal 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
deck and the line opened in the following year. The bridge has a single span of 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
20.5 metres between abutments, which are skewed at 25° to cater for the relative 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
alignments of the railway and Lorne Road. The bridge carries two tracks on 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
separate, parallel decks with two outer main girders, and a central main girder 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
positioned between the tracks.

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
28 The longitudinal timbers vary in depth between 275 mm on the left-hand (cess) 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
and 350 mm on the right-hand (six-foot) rail. The difference in depth is required 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
to achieve a designed track cross-level (cant) of 75 mm. The longitudinal timbers 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
were last renewed in 2008.

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
29 Network Rail monitors its track using a fleet of track recording vehicles. These 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
vehicles are formed into trains and cover the national network to a pre-determined 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
schedule. They provide data and information to assist track maintenance staff to 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---

The sequence of events

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
Events preceding the accident

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
36 Train 6Z54 completed loading at 03:45 hrs on 23 January 2020 and departed 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
from Barking Eurohub at 05:33 hrs. The train proceeded via Barking station and 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
crossed Barking flyover. It passed Woodgrange Park Junction where it joined the 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
up Tottenham & Hampstead line at about 05:49 hrs.

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
37 The on-train monitoring recorder (OTMR) data from the locomotive indicates that 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
the driver applied full power to climb the 1 in 65 gradient south of Woodgrange 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
Park Junction onto the elevated section of line. The train’s speed had reduced 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
from 29 mph (47 km/h) at the junction to approximately 22 mph (35 km/h) when 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
wagon 3415 reached bridge 456.

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
Events during the accident

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
38 The right-hand wheel of the rearmost wheelset on wagon 3415 derailed as it 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
passed over bridge 456 (figure 7). Less than a second later, the left-hand wheel 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
on the leading wheelset of following wagon 3114 also derailed causing both 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
rails to rotate outwards (figure 8). The driver was unaware of these events and 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
maintained full power. The train gradually accelerated to 35 mph (56 km/h). 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
39 Wagon 3114, the second derailed wagon, re-railed itself after travelling 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
approximately 230 metres and crossing two other longitudinal timber bridges. 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
Rerailing occurred before Wanstead Park station, as the left-hand curve started to 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
transition into a right-hand curve.

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
inside the right-hand rail for approximately 450 metres. As the train traversed a 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
right- hand curve through Wanstead Park station, marks on the railhead indicate 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
that the associated left-hand wheel climbed over the railhead and derailed to 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
the left. The wagon then continued with both wheels of the rear wheelset of 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
the trailing bogie derailed to the left. In this condition it crossed a further seven

the train brakes to automatically apply. This occurred about six minutes after

Analysis

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
Identification of the immediate cause 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
43 The track was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 6Z54 passed 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
over it.

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
44 A derailment mark on the inside face of the right-hand rail on bridge 456 showed 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
that a wheel had dropped into the four-foot (the area between the rails) at 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
this location. Another derailment mark was identified on the inside face of the 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
left- hand rail about seven metres beyond the first mark, showing that a second 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
wheel dropped into the four-foot. Post-accident examination of the two wagons 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
involved showed that the wheels on the derailed wheelsets were at the correct 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
spacing. There was no evidence that they had moved inwards, along the axle, at 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
any time. This demonstrates that derailment was a consequence of rail movement 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
causing the track gauge (the horizontal distance between the rails) to increase by 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
at least 85 mm, sufficient to allow the right-hand wheel of a wagon to drop inside 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
the right-hand rail (figure 7). The locations of the derailed wheelsets (trailing on 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
one bogie and then leading on a following bogie) and the wheels (right then left) 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
are consistent with classic curving behaviour of a conventional bogie vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
on small radius curves, and explain the order that the wheels dropped into the 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
four- foot.

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
45 The absence of derailment marks on the right-hand wheel of wagon 3114 shows 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
that wagon 3415 derailed at the first (right-hand rail) derailment mark and 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
wagon 3114 at the second (left-hand rail). It is likely that spreading of the rails 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
by the derailed wheelset of wagon 3415 provided room for the leading wheelset 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
of the following wagon 3114 to derail. The absence of significant damage to 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
the left- hand rail at the location where wagon 3415 derailed indicates that the 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
accident was initially caused by the right-hand rail rotating or moving outwards.

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
46 The relatively low speed of the train meant that the cross-level or cant at this 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
location was greater than required, a condition known as cant excess. When cant 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
excess is present on a small radius curve, the leading outer wheelset on a bogie 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
would be expected to be displaced to the outside of the curve (right wheel) and 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
the trailing wheelset displaced toward the inside (left wheel), and this is the likely 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
reason why it was the right wheel on the trailing wheelset of the trailing bogie of 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
wagon 3415 that dropped into the four-foot. 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
47 A defect pushing the leading wheelset of the trailing bogie further towards the 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
right-hand rail (paragraph 113) is likely to have increased outward lateral forces 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
on the right-hand rail.  

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
Identification of causal factors 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
48 The accident occurred due to a combination of the following causal factors:

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
a. the rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
gauge (paragraph 49)

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
b. track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived from 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the correct 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
location (paragraph 74)

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
d. the condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
lateral forces on the track (paragraph 111). 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
Each of these factors is now considered in turn.

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
49 The rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
gauge.

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
50 The up line across bridge 456 was supported by four longitudinal timbers under 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
each rail, each about 6 metres long and laid end to end. The combined length of 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
just over 24 metres was sufficient to cross the bridge and extend a few metres 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
onto the embankment at each end, a feature known as a flying end. This was to 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
provide a transition between the relatively stiff bridge deck and the more flexible 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
ballasted embankment. In the direction of travel, the timbers were numbered 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
R4 to R1 supporting the left-hand rail (cess rail) and 4L to 1L supporting the 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
right- hand rail (six-foot rail). The initial derailment occurred close to the joint 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
between timbers 2L and 1L at the location marked POD 1 on figure 12.

--- Document Chunk 569 ---

51 The standard gauge (distance between the vertical faces of two rails on the same 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
track) on Network Rail infrastructure is 1435 mm. Gauge is either measured 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
statically, for instance using a hand-held track gauge, or dynamically when 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
additional deflection due to the forces from passing trains is taken into account. 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
Dynamic measurements can be recorded either by equipment fitted to the track 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
or to a train. The response by maintenance staff to wide gauge faults is specified 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
by Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/001 mod11 (issue 8), published September 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
2015.

52 The standard indicates that for a line on which the maximum permissible speed 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
for trains is between 26 mph and 50 mph (42 km/h and 80 km/h), the following 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
limits apply. If either static or dynamic gauge reaches 1450 mm, the alert limit 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
is exceeded and track maintenance staff are required to plan remedial action. 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
If the static plus dynamic movement reaches 1460 mm, the intervention limit is 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
exceeded and remedial action is required within 14 days, or 36 hours if gauge 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
reaches 1470 mm. If the static gauge plus the additional deflection from passing 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
trains is 1478 mm or greater, the immediate action limit is reached and the line 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
must be immediately blocked to all traffic. These limits are equivalent to wide 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
gauge of 15 mm (alert limit), 25 mm and 35 mm (intervention limits) and 43 mm 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
(immediate action limit). 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
53 Bridge 456’s longitudinal timbers were last renewed in 2008 using Douglas Fir 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
(softwood). Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 (issue 4), which was current 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
in 2008, stated:

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
‘For complete replacement of Longitudinal Timbers on lines with track 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
categories 1A, 1 and 2 only hardwood shall be used. Hardwood timber shall be 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
used for other lines unless the written approval is obtained from the Railtrack 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
Director’s Nominee for the use of softwood.’

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
54 The track category is derived from the speed of traffic and equivalent tonnage 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
using the line, and ranges from 6 (low speed and low use) to 1A, the highest. 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
It is used to determine inspection frequencies and renewals specifications. In 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
2008, this section of line carried 2.9 equivalent million gross tonnes per annum2 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
(EMGTPA) and was rated track category 4.

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
55 Between 2008 and 2018, there was a significant increase in rail traffic using 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
the Barking to Gospel Oak route. During this period the annual tonnage carried 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
increased fivefold from 2.9 EMGTPA to 15.5 EMGTPA. This was due to both the 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
doubling of the frequency of passenger services operated by London Overground, 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
and increased freight traffic associated with Barking Eurohub and the London 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
Gateway container port near Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, which opened in 2013. As 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
traffic increased, the track category changed in steps from 4 to 2. It subsequently 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
dropped back to category 3 in the immediate vicinity of bridge 456 due to the 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
40 mph (64 km/h) permanent speed restriction at that location. Most of the route 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
remained within track category 2 (paragraph 22). 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
56 The maximum weight of vehicles permitted over bridge 456 was managed 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
through Network Rail’s Route Availability (RA) process. The highest routine 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
category is RA8 which permits rail vehicles with a maximum gross laden weight 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
of 91.4 tonnes, but heavier freight wagons are permitted on some lines by a 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
dispensation issued using Network Rail’s RT3973 Heavy Axle Weight process 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
after an assessment by the route’s structures and track engineers. Over 25% of 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
loaded freight trains operate under a dispensation. The Barking to Gospel Oak 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
route had a dispensation allowing its use by wagons of the types in train 6Z54 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
loaded to RA10, a category permitting a maximum gross laden weight of 101.6 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
tonnes and a maximum axle load of 25.4 tonnes. 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
2 The EMGTPA value is obtained by multiplying actual annual tonnage of traffic by factors allowing for axle weight 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
and speed.

least 25 years.

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
58 A GRP (glass fibre reinforced plastic) walkway with a solid surface was installed 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
on the up line between the longitudinal timbers on bridge 456 when the timbers 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
were renewed in 2008. A similar walkway was installed on the down line across 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
the bridge in 2018 during bridge refurbishment work. 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
Inadequate rail restraint

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
59 Evidence of inadequate rail restraint over a period of time is provided by Network 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
Rail’s track gauge measurements. The gauge across bridge 456 had exceeded 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
the alert limit since at least June 2018 when static gauge of up to 1455 mm was 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
recorded during a detailed inspection (paragraph 96), equivalent to wide gauge 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
of 20 mm. Track recording vehicles had recorded dynamic gauge exceeding the 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
intervention limit at about the same location since March 2019 (figure 13). The 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
difference between static and dynamic gauge demonstrates that the track was 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
flexible enough for the gauge to widen significantly under train loading. Issues 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
associated with the management of track gauge are discussed at paragraph 95 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
onwards.

60 RAIB took post-accident measurements on the bridge to determine if the stiffness 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
of the track varied on approach to the point of derailment. A hydraulic ram was 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
installed between the rails, and the pressure was increased in increments, 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
creating spreading forces up to 50 kN (equivalent to 5 tonnes). This test was 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
repeated at five locations across the bridge. The results show that the rails were 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
less able to resist movement under the lateral forces imposed by moving trains 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
as the point of derailment was approached (figure 14). These results are broadly 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
consistent with Network Rail’s track gauge measurements. However, it should 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
be noted that accident damage meant that measured stiffness in the area of 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
significant damage will be less than before the accident and, due to distribution 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
of load along the rails, measured stiffness will also be lower than pre-accident 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
values on the approach to this area. 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
Figure 14: Change in track stiffness between baseplates. These were numbered from 34 at the start of 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
the bridge to 0 at the point of derailment (POD1).

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
61 Further evidence of pre-accident track movement is provided by the right-hand 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
rail’s railhead profile, which varied in shape across the bridge (figure 15). A 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
new rail is rolled to a constant profile, but the wear from passing train wheels, 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
particularly on the outside rail on curved track, will gradually change this shape. 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
The rail showed a relatively consistent amount of wear on the side of the railhead 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
(sidewear), but a pronounced change occurred a few metres before the point of 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
derailment. In this area, there was less sidewear, suggesting that lateral loads 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
from train wheels caused the rail to move away from the wheel flanges. The 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
consequential reduction in lateral force exerted on the outer rail by the wheel 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
flange would have reduced the amount of rail wear.

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
the transoms and tie bars connecting them. They were taken to a secure site and 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
laid out for examination by RAIB, an independent timber specialist commissioned

by RAIB and Network Rail (figure 16 and figure 17). The panels were dismantled

63 The section of timber 2L supporting the track at the point of derailment (figure 18 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
and figure 19) was cut into sections and examined. It was found to be saturated 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
with water and extremely soft. A long probe was pushed into the wood at several 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
locations without meeting resistance and part of the timber disintegrated while 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
being moved during the examination. There was evidence of baseplate screw 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
holes having been plugged and re-drilled, indicating that a previous attempt had 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
been made to restore the track gauge at this location. This method of re-gauging 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
can only be regarded as a temporary measure in softwood as there is often

insufficient sound material to withstand the forces imposed.

64 The section of Timber 1L (figure 20) immediately after the point of derailment had 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
evidence of a longstanding corner fracture (split) and moisture ingress. This was 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
in the area where the leading right-hand wheel of wagon 3415’s trailing bogie was 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
probably pushing against the rail (see paragraph 111) at the moment the trailing 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
right-hand wheel derailed. The longitudinal fracture ran through the outermost 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
baseplate screws. It is likely that this fracture was caused by lateral loads 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
imposed by the screws and stresses associated with natural timber shrinkage 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
around the screws.

65 The split in timber 1L had been identified and recorded during a detailed 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
inspection in June 2019 (refer to paragraph 105). The post-accident examination 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
found evidence of fungi growing within the wood indicating the presence of 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
air. The presence of a split along the line of the large screws securing the rail 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
baseplates meant that the outer row of screws became ineffective in securing the 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
rail. The additional horizontal force applied to the inner row of baseplate screws 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
had caused their holes to become oval shaped, as the metal screw pressed into 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
the partly-decayed wood due to lateral loading from trains (figure 21).

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
66 The timber specialist’s report included the following conclusions: 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
a. timbers 1L and 2L, adjacent to the derailment location, both had significant 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
decay which would have severely reduced their integrity/structural capabilities

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
b. the extent of decay recorded in timber 2L for approximately 2 metres 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
approaching the point of derailment was up to 70% loss of the cross section

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
c. the amount of decay in timbers 1L and 2L would have resulted in these 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
timbers being at risk of deforming either permanently, or when loaded.  

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
67 Laboratory examination confirmed that timber preservative was present on the 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
surfaces, and to a depth of a few millimetres below the surfaces of timbers 1L and 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
2L. The heartwood, the dense inner part of the tree trunk which forms the majority 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
of a timber section of this size, was not protected. The heartwood of Douglas 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
Fir originating from North America and Europe is classified as ‘extremely difficult 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
to treat’,3 even under vacuum and pressure treatment cycles.  Preservative 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
treatments limited to near the surface of the wood can result in timber appearing 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
superficially sound while deeper decay is hidden.

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
68 It is probable that the rot was partly a consequence of rust flakes collecting on 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
the deck and trapping moisture around the base of the timbers. Evidence that 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
this was occurring is provided by photographs taken during an inspection in June 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
2018 (figure 22). Some of this debris was removed during bridge strengthening 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
and refurbishment works completed later that year. It is also probable that 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
evaporation of water from the bridge deck and some faces of the longitudinal 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
timbers was restricted by the solid walkway installed between the rails on the up 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
line in 2008, which restricted ventilation (figure 5).

Lateral restraint to timbers

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
69 Lateral restraint for the longitudinal timbers was provided by cleats attached to 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
the bridge deck and by the tie rod and transom (strut) arrangement described in 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
paragraph 24. The timbers supporting the right-hand rail were significantly deeper 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
than the timbers supporting the left-hand rail due to the need to allow a 75 mm 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
cant on the curve (paragraph 28). 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
70 The height of the cleats retaining the right-hand rail timbers was less than 50% 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
of the timbers’ depth (figure 23). The combined effect of the cleat height and 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
tie rod position was to leave the upper section of the timbers 4L-1L with no 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
lateral restraint except that provided by transferring load downwards through 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
the decayed timber. The tie rods connecting the timbers together to maintain 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
track gauge were set horizontally. They passed through the left-hand timbers at 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
mid- height, but consequently were below mid-height for the deeper right-hand 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
timbers (figure 24).

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
71 A revision to standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 (issue 6) published in 2014, requires 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
new or replacement cleats to be designed with a minimum height of not less 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
than 2/3 the depth of the longitudinal bearer. Although this requirement was not 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
retrospective, it gives an indication of the importance of the relative height of the 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
cleats in restraining the timbers, particularly on curved track where the track is 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
subject to lateral forces.

72 Junction plates connecting the timbers also extended for only part of the timbers’ 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
depth (figure 23). This meant that the outside plate connecting 2L and 1L provided 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
no support to the upper part of the timber and this is a possible reason for the 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
longitudinal split developing in this area. The combination of decayed timber and 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
limited direct support from the tie rods and cleats, possibly exacerbated by the 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
junction plate arrangement, meant that lateral loading from train wheels would 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
result in relatively large movements of the right-hand rail.

73 The track’s ability to resist gauge widening on bridge 456 is likely to have 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
worsened when the vertical split in timber 1L joined up with a horizontal split, 

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
displacing a section of timber (figure 20). Some of the gauge widening forces 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
which could not be resisted by timber 1L will have been transferred by the rail into 

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
the adjacent section of timber 2L which was already weakened by decay.

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
74 Track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived 

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
from this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the 

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
correct location.

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
75 Track geometry data obtained from track recording vehicles (paragraph 29) is 

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
supplied to the TME responsible for each section of track. They are required by 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/001/mod11 to review this data within three 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
weeks of issue. The data includes a trace, comprising a multi-channel graph 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
showing gauge, alignment and other track geometry parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
76 Geometry faults which exceed the intervention limit are also listed, with their 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
global positioning system (GPS) co-ordinates, on a track geometry action report. 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
This is also known as an immediate action report or fault report. Network Rail 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
states that these co- ordinates are accurate to ±1m, providing the track recording 

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
vehicle is able to receive a strong enough GPS signal. The signal can be 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
restricted when a train is within a structure such as a tunnel or station. There are 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
no features of this type at the accident site.

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
Evidence of track movement at bridge 456

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
77 RAIB has reviewed track recording vehicle data for the up line across bridge 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
456 from June 2018 onwards. On 20 June 2018, a dynamic wide gauge fault of 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
23 mm was recorded on bridge 456. This value was 8 mm greater than static 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
gauge recorded at the same location during a detailed inspection on 6 June 2018 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
(paragraph 97), indicating that track movement was already occurring under 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
trains. At this stage, the dynamic gauge fault remained below the intervention limit 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
(25 mm).

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
78 Similar gauge faults were apparent on two subsequent track recording vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
runs during 2018, but the run on 6 February 2019 indicated that the gauge had 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
significantly improved, recording wide gauge of just 10.5 mm near the POD. 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
However, the next run on 6 March 2019 recorded a wide gauge fault of 26.9 mm. 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
Network Rail’s central track geometry processing team compared this data with 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
the previous recording on 6 February 2019 and declared the gauge data invalid 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
for a 10 chain (201 metre) length of track which, by chance, included bridge 456. 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
Consequently, the data was discounted and did not appear in the associated fault 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
report so no action was taken. RAIB has identified that the February data was 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
significantly different to previous recordings and may itself have been spurious.

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
79 On 1 May 2019, the next track recording vehicle run recorded a wide gauge fault 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
of 29.8 mm in the same location, exhibiting a similar ‘shape’ to the data recorded 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
on 6 March (figure 25). This was the first recognised indication of a gauge fault 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
exceeding the intervention limit at this location, and was shown on the trace and 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
listed on the fault report.

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
80 On 23 May 2019, track maintenance staff from Barking depot, led by the team 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
leader [track maintenance], attended site during an overnight possession of the 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
line. The team leader stated that they used an approved app on a Network Rail 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
mobile phone to locate the fault. This app works by manually entering the GPS 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
co-ordinates, and this causes the phone to vibrate when within five metres of the 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
site, and the display to change colour when within three metres, giving staff a 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
three to five metre radius around the reported site to locate and inspect the fault. 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
The process is dependent on the mobile phone’s accuracy when receiving the 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
GPS signal. In this case, although the GPS co-ordinates put the fault on bridge 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
456 (figure 26), staff undertook work about eight metres west of the actual fault 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
location and on a section of track with concrete sleepers. 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
81 The team leader used a cross-level gauge to identify a section of track with 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
wide gauge, and found nine concrete sleepers with crushed or displaced nylon 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
insulation pads4 supporting the right-hand (high) rail. Members of the team 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
unclipped the rail, renewed the nylon pads and clipped the rail back up. When 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
they rechecked with the cross-level gauge, it showed that the gauge was back 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
within tolerance. The team leader signed a form to confirm that work had been 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
undertaken, and under the heading ‘Details of work carried out to repair the 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
fault’, wrote ‘Regauged track’. The team leader stated that he had a quick look at 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
the longitudinal timbers on the bridge and measured the gauge but did not find 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
anything to suggest a wide gauge fault that exceeded the intervention limit on the 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
bridge. 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
82 On 29 May 2019, the next scheduled track recording vehicle run identified and 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
recorded a wide gauge fault in the same location and same magnitude as on 1 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
May (figure 27). The shape of the graph indicated a very similar pattern of gauge 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
widening. On this occasion, the GPS co-ordinates on the fault report put the 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
location of the wide gauge fault just off the bridge.

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
4 Pads are required to electrically insulate the rail from sleepers and clips, and are available in different sizes so 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
they can be used to adjust the track gauge.

87 For the next two track recording vehicle runs on 11 December 2019 and 8

January 2020, wide gauge faults of 26.5 mm and 30.1 mm respectively were 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
recorded on bridge 456. On both occasions, the fault exceeded the intervention 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
limit (figure 29 and figure 30) but was missing from the associated fault report. 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
88 The same issue caused both omissions and is explained by an extract from the

faults, automatically highlighted in red on the trace, corresponding with bridges

89 The TrueTrak recording system used by Network Rail’s fleet of track recording 

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
vehicles incorporates a feature to provide a single GPS location for each track 

--- Document Chunk 1170 ---
geometry fault. Fault sheets are produced following each run which show the 

--- Document Chunk 1171 ---
type of fault detected, its magnitude and the GPS location where the fault is 

--- Document Chunk 1172 ---
most severe. They do not show the distance over which the fault extends. To 

--- Document Chunk 1173 ---
enable it to distinguish between consecutive faults, the processing software 

--- Document Chunk 1174 ---
applies a pre- set quantity known as the hysteresis threshold value. The recorded 

--- Document Chunk 1175 ---
magnitude of the fault must improve until it is better than this threshold for the 

--- Document Chunk 1176 ---
system to register the end of one fault and the start of the next.

--- Document Chunk 1177 ---
90 For wide gauge, the hysteresis threshold value was set nationally at 5.8 mm, 

--- Document Chunk 1178 ---
equivalent to a gauge of 1440.8 mm. However, as gauge widening may occur 

--- Document Chunk 1179 ---
over long sections of track, particularly on curves, only identifying the location and 

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
magnitude of the peak (widest) reading will have the effect of hiding other peaks 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
within a length of track which continually exceeds the threshold.

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
91 On both 11 December 2019 and 8 January 2020, the hysteresis threshold value 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
for gauge was exceeded continuously for a distance of about 240 metres on a 

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
section of track which included bridges 456 and 448. Consequently, this was 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
reported as a single fault with a GPS location corresponding to the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
recorded wide gauge which occurred at bridge 448. The lower peak on bridge 456 

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
was not reported on either fault sheet and was therefore not addressed.

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
92 Gauge widening greater than the hysteresis threshold between bridges 456 and 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
448 probably occurred because of a combination of worn or damaged nylon 

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
insulation pads and rail wear. Network Rail has confirmed that this section of track 

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
did not require designed gauge widening.5  

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
93 When the trace and fault reports were received by the TME following a track 

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
recording vehicle run, technical staff at Barking depot reviewed the trace and 

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
compared it with the previous trace. The purpose was to identify repeat faults 

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---
and poor sections of track where intervention is required. Actionable faults which 

--- Document Chunk 1196 ---
exceeded the intervention limit (also known as Level 2 faults) were reviewed 

--- Document Chunk 1197 ---
at a regular maintenance planning meeting and entered into Network Rail’s 

--- Document Chunk 1198 ---
computerised workbank (Ellipse) so they could be monitored and closed-out 

--- Document Chunk 1199 ---
when remedial work was complete. The TME did not consider that it was the 

--- Document Chunk 1200 ---
responsibility of the depot staff to check that faults shown on the trace were 

--- Document Chunk 1201 ---
included on the fault reports and there was no requirement to do so in the 

--- Document Chunk 1202 ---
Network Rail procedure TRK/001 mod 11 ‘Track geometry - Inspections and 

--- Document Chunk 1203 ---
minimum actions’, issue 8 published in September 2015. However, if the review 

--- Document Chunk 1204 ---
by depot staff identified an anomaly, this would be checked with the central track 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
geometry processing team and, if necessary, the fault would be added to the 

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
Ellipse work bank for correction.

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
94 The data from the track recording vehicle run on 8 January was received by the 

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---
TME on 15 January. At the time of the accident, the technical review was ongoing 

--- Document Chunk 1209 ---
in preparation for a maintenance planning meeting scheduled for 23 January (the 

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
day of the accident).

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---

The inspection process

--- Document Chunk 1221 ---
96 On 6 June 2018, the team leader [longitudinal timbers] for Barking depot 

--- Document Chunk 1222 ---
undertook an annual detailed inspection of the timbers supporting the up line 

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
on bridge 456. This was a role for which he had received specialist training and 

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
which he had undertaken for six years. He was responsible for inspecting 21 

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
structures, most of which comprised two individual spans and which incorporated 

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
282 individual timbers. 

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
97 Although the team leader was not undertaking a scheduled Supervisor’s visual 

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
track inspection, he used form TEF3021 ‘Supervisor’s Visual Inspection of 

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
Longitudinal Timbers – Issue 6 Sept 2013’ to record static gauge readings at 12 

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
positions across the bridge, as there was nowhere to record this information on 

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
the detailed inspection form itself. His report indicates that the static track gauge 

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
ranged between 1445 mm and 1455 mm, equivalent to wide gauge of 10 mm to 

--- Document Chunk 1233 ---
20 mm. As the static gauge exceeded the alert limit of 1450 mm, equivalent to 

--- Document Chunk 1234 ---
wide gauge of 15 mm, at several locations towards the middle of the bridge, he 

--- Document Chunk 1235 ---
recorded ‘adjust gauge’ on this form.

--- Document Chunk 1236 ---
98 He also used form TEF3014 ‘Detailed Inspection of Longitudinal Timber System 

--- Document Chunk 1237 ---
report – Issue 5 Dec 2010’ to record the detailed inspection. He noted that timber 

--- Document Chunk 1238 ---
2L was in ‘good’ condition, but that there was a 300 mm long split at the end of 

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
the timber where the derailment occurred. He recorded that timber 1L was in ‘fair’ 

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
condition with rot starting at the end furthest from timber 2L. He also identified 

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
that the plate decking was corroding, with debris on the bridge. He assessed that 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
all the timbers on the up line had five years’ remaining life. On the final page, he 

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
recorded ‘Some of the timbers are starting to show signs of deterioration on the 

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
up road [up line] so life span has been reduced.’  

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
99 The GRP walkway fitted between the timbers had not been removed as required 

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
by standard TRK/3038 (issue 6), so the team leader was unable to view the 

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
inside faces of the timber. Clause 8.2 which covers the annual detailed inspection 

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
states:

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
‘Where walkway boards prevent inspection of significant elements of the 

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
longitudinal timber system e.g. cleats, transoms and tie rods, the boards shall 

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
be removed to allow inspection.’

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
100 The team leader recorded ‘Underside of timbers not inspected’ and ‘Inside of 

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
timber not accessible due to fibre glass walkway’ in his report. 

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
101 The presence of fixed walkways was an ongoing issue at four spans on the 

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
Barking to Gospel Oak line where there were walkways installed, including 

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
bridges 456 and 448. The team leader stated that walkways were never removed 

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
for inspections (figure 32). The walkway on bridge 456 had been installed to 

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
assist staff walking along the track, but as the bridge was located on a section of 

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
track where access was prohibited except during a possession or line blockage, 

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
it was rarely used. As there was insufficient time during a possession to remove/

--- Document Chunk 1261 ---
reinstall the walkways and complete a detailed examination, the TME planned to 

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
have the walkways removed permanently during 2020.

102 In December 2018, the TME visited bridge 456 during a planned two-yearly 

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
track maintenance engineer’s inspection. He observed and recorded a split in a 

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
longitudinal timber on the down line, but did not observe anything amiss with the 

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
track or any of the longitudinal timbers on the up line. The first indication of a wide 

--- Document Chunk 1274 ---
gauge fault was not apparent until three months later (paragraph 78). 

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
103 In March 2019, the acting team leader [longitudinal timbers] took over 

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
responsibility for detailed longitudinal timber inspections for Barking depot. On 19 

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
June 2019, he undertook an annual detailed inspection of bridge 456. He used 

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
form TEF3021 to record the gauge which ranged from 1448 mm to 1453 mm, 

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
equivalent to wide gauge of 13 mm to 18 mm, and was 14 mm near the POD. The 

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
gauge exceeded the alert limit but remained below the intervention limit and he 

--- Document Chunk 1281 ---
recorded ‘adjust gauge’ on the form.

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
104 During the detailed inspection he stated that he checked for damage, loose 

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
screws, and large splits but found nothing loose. He was unable to inspect the 

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
inside of the timbers and reported ‘inside of timber not accessible due to fibre 

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
glass walkway’. He also identified that 12 cleats were corroding and wrote ‘New 

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
cleat system required.’  

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
105 He identified a split in timber 1L and observed that part of the timber was out of 

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
alignment. He recorded ‘15mm split’ in the relevant part of the TEF3104 report 

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
and included three photographs of the split in his report (figure 33 and figure 34).

106 In answer to the question ‘what method did you use to test timber integrity’, the 

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
report states ‘hammer and drill’. The report does not record which timbers were 

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
tested, but the acting team leader [longitudinal timbers] did not identify decay 

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
within timbers 1L or 2L. Standard TRK/3038 (issue 6) states ‘Test drillings of 

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
timber shall only be taken when there are signs of deterioration or other grounds 

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
to suspect decay of the timber.’  The photographs show that the visible faces of 

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
timber 2L showed no sign of the interior deterioration. This was probably because 

--- Document Chunk 1302 ---
of the effect of the timber preservative (paragraph 67). 

--- Document Chunk 1303 ---
107 The acting team leader had not reviewed a copy of the most recent track 

--- Document Chunk 1304 ---
recording vehicle trace prior to commencing his inspection, despite his training 

--- Document Chunk 1305 ---
telling him that he should do so (paragraph 134). He was therefore unaware that 

--- Document Chunk 1306 ---
during the previous month, two track recording vehicle runs had recorded wide

gauge faults on, or near, the bridge (paragraphs 79 and 82).

--- Document Chunk 1311 ---
vertical movement Under Load’ and ‘Is there any sign of gauge spread’. He also 

--- Document Chunk 1312 ---
reported that drainage was ‘G’ (i.e. Good) and marked Timber 1L condition as 

--- Document Chunk 1313 ---
‘Fair’, and Timber 2L condition as ‘Good’, with 4 years’ serviceable life remaining 

--- Document Chunk 1314 ---
on all timbers. He did not add any comment on the final page of the report headed 

--- Document Chunk 1315 ---
‘General observation & Recommendations’ because he considered it would be 

--- Document Chunk 1316 ---
repeating information in the body of the report. On 3 July 2019, the TME signed 

--- Document Chunk 1317 ---
off both the TEF3021 and TEF3014 reports without adding any comments. The 

--- Document Chunk 1318 ---
TME stated that it was difficult from a photograph to know the severity of the split 

--- Document Chunk 1319 ---
and there was nothing that brought his attention to the split being a concern.

109 The assistant track manager undertook planned supervisor’s visual inspections 

--- Document Chunk 1321 ---
of the longitudinal timbers on 8 February, 23 May, 22 August and 10 November 

--- Document Chunk 1322 ---
2019. On each occasion, he measured the static gauge (figure 13) and recorded 

--- Document Chunk 1323 ---
this on a TEF3021 form. In the vicinity of the POD, gauge measurements ranged 

--- Document Chunk 1324 ---
between 1455 mm (equivalent to 20 mm wide gauge) on 23 May 2019, and 1447 

--- Document Chunk 1325 ---
mm (equivalent to 12 mm wide gauge) on 10 November 2019. He marked the 

--- Document Chunk 1326 ---
timber condition ‘Fair’ for all eight longitudinal timbers on the up line on each 

--- Document Chunk 1327 ---
occasion.

110 On the report for the 22 August 2019 inspection, the supervisor wrote ‘timber 

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
gauge job’ with a reference number. This referred to a work order to correct the 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
wide gauge fault that had been raised in Ellipse on 25 July 2018 following the 

--- Document Chunk 1336 ---
note added to the detailed inspection report the previous month (paragraph 97). 

--- Document Chunk 1337 ---
However, this activity had been repeatedly reprioritised and the work deferred 

--- Document Chunk 1338 ---
because site reports and inspections indicated that the gauge was not 

--- Document Chunk 1339 ---
deteriorating and had not yet exceeded the intervention limit. The TME also 

--- Document Chunk 1340 ---
understood that the previous five track recording vehicle runs had shown there 

--- Document Chunk 1341 ---
were no gauge faults on the bridge, and that the gauge faults that were shown 

--- Document Chunk 1342 ---
related to the concrete sleepers near the bridge with crushed nylon pads where 

--- Document Chunk 1343 ---
remedial work had been undertaken (paragraph 81). Although there was an 

--- Document Chunk 1344 ---
established process for raising queries, the TME did not consider it was his 

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
team’s responsibility to cross-check the centrally-produced fault sheets against 

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
the traces for errors or omissions. 

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
111 The condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
lateral loading on the track.

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
112 The curving behaviour of conventional rolling stock means that significant lateral 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
track forces are normal when trains negotiate small radius curves. However, 

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
the presence of unusually high lateral forces applied to the track by the trailing 

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
bogie of wagon 3415 is suggested by the following six wagons not derailing when 

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
travelling over the position where the bogie derailed (the leading bogie of wagon 

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
3114 derailed beyond this position). This implies that the rails on the curve spread 

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
outwards as the trailing bogie of wagon 3415 travelled past, and moved back 

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
before the remaining wagons passed. Damage to bridge timbers (paragraphs 62 

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
to 73) indicates that most of the spread was due to movement of the right-hand 

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
rail. It is possible that the trailing bogie applied unusually high lateral forces 

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
because of a combination of the following two factors:     

--- Document Chunk 1360 ---
l a defect on wagon 3415 (paragraph 113)

--- Document Chunk 1361 ---
l uneven payload (paragraph 124).

(figure 35) on the right-hand rail is provided in the following paragraphs by 

--- Document Chunk 1365 ---
considering wheel flange wear over the previous three years. Curving behaviour 

--- Document Chunk 1366 ---
under cant excess suggests that the right wheel flange of the trailing bogies of 

--- Document Chunk 1367 ---
each wagon would have been close to, and probably in contact with, the outer

(right-hand) rail (paragraph 46).

114 The corners of the wagon are numbered 1 to 4 in a clockwise direction (as seen 

--- Document Chunk 1389 ---
from above). On 23 January 2020, the 2-3 end of the wagon was leading so the 

--- Document Chunk 1390 ---
trailing bogie was at the 1-4 end of the wagon. Analysis of maintenance records 

--- Document Chunk 1391 ---
provided by the wagon’s owner, VTG, shows that wagon 3415 was removed 

--- Document Chunk 1392 ---
from service in November 2017, August 2018 and September 2019 because its 

--- Document Chunk 1393 ---
wheel flanges had worn thin and were approaching the wear limit. For wheels with 

--- Document Chunk 1394 ---
the P6 profile, as fitted to this wagon, the minimum permitted flange thickness 

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
is 24 mm. On each occasion, the significant flange wear had occurred to the 

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
wheels fitted to the 1-4 end bogie, but only affected one wheel on each wheelset. 

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
Records do not show whether this was the left-hand side or right-hand side. On 

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
each occasion, two full profile wheelsets were fitted to the 1-4 end bogie before 

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
the wagon re-entered traffic. VTG’s Wheel Exchange Authorisation forms show 

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
that throughout this time, the wheelsets on the 2-3 end bogie experienced normal 

--- Document Chunk 1401 ---
wear and were not changed.

--- Document Chunk 1402 ---
115 The most recent wheelset change took place in October 2019. Following the 

--- Document Chunk 1403 ---
derailment on 23 January 2020, wheel measurements showed that the right- hand 

--- Document Chunk 1404 ---
flanges on the two wheelsets fitted to the 1-4 end bogie were at least 2 mm 

--- Document Chunk 1405 ---
thinner than those on the left-hand wheels, despite having been in service for 

--- Document Chunk 1406 ---
less than four months. This unusually high wear is consistent with the right-hand 

--- Document Chunk 1407 ---
wheels of this bogie running for longer in flange contact with the rail than the 

--- Document Chunk 1408 ---
left- hand wheels.

--- Document Chunk 1409 ---
116 A detailed inspection of the 1-4 end bogie, undertaken by RAIB before the wagon 

--- Document Chunk 1410 ---
body was lifted from the bogie, found that the bogie centre pivot, provided to allow 

--- Document Chunk 1411 ---
bogie rotation when the wagon goes around curves, was offset by 7 mm to the 

--- Document Chunk 1412 ---
right of the wagon body centre-line. This suggested an issue with the bogie pivot 

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
so RAIB and VTG carried out further examinations of this centre pivot, and the 

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
2-3 end bogie centre pivot, after the body was lifted from the bogies.

117 To permit bogie rotation, the top of each bogie is fitted with a bogie centre pivot

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
supports a slightly smaller top centre pivot fitted to the underside of the wagon’s

underframe (figure 37). The two parts are designed to allow a radial clearance of 

--- Document Chunk 1429 ---
approximately 6 mm between each of the vertical faces within the assembly. This 

--- Document Chunk 1430 ---
is to allow the bogie to move laterally into the appropriate position relative to the

119 The bogie centre pivots incorporate a central upstand, 40 mm high and 108 

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
mm diameter with a 63 mm diameter hole to contain a pin. The upstand fits into 

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
a recess in the top centre pivot. On the 2-3 end, the top centre pivot recess 

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
measured 43 mm deep, into which the 40 mm high upstand could fit without 

--- Document Chunk 1456 ---
making contact at the top when the large horizonal faces of the castings were 

--- Document Chunk 1457 ---
in contact. On the 1-4 end, the recess was also 43 mm deep, but it contained a 

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
5mm thick plug of hardened debris-impregnated grease which had the effect of 

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
reducing its depth to 38 mm (figure 40 and figure 41). The grease plug pressed 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
against the top of the upstand and carried part of the load intended to be carried 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
on the large horizontal faces. This prevented the bearing from being correctly

120 Part of the recovered grease plug was tested by RAIB to determine the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
compressive force the material could withstand. Samples of the grease were 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
formed into 12 mm diameter x 4.7 mm thick pellets and placed into a testing rig 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
which restricted lateral expansion. A force of up to 60 kN (6,000 kg) was applied 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
and the amount of compression measured and recorded. A series of samples 

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
were each able to support a load of at least 170 N/mm2 before the grease started 

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
to break down and flow. The test rig reproduced loading conditions that were 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
similar to those that the grease plug was subject to when constrained in the 

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
bogie pivot. As the top of the central upstand has a surface area of approximately 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
6,000 mm2, the grease plug would have been capable of carrying the weight of 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
one end of a fully loaded wagon body. 

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
121 When the bogie was installed, the grease would have been of a normal viscosity 

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
and would have flowed relatively freely. Grease contains oil and a thickening 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
agent, but on examination, the grease had lost the volatile compounds of the oil, 

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
and gained some debris. This had resulted in it gradually hardening to form the 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
plug found in the recess.

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
122 The source and role of the three pieces of metal debris in the grease plug is 

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
uncertain, but they may have formed as a result of earlier repair work. It is 

--- Document Chunk 1511 ---
possible that the metal debris had played a part in transferring part of the wagon 

--- Document Chunk 1512 ---
body load into an off-centre position on the upstand, so encouraging an uneven 

--- Document Chunk 1513 ---
build-up of dried grease to one side of the pivot.  This could have been enough to 

--- Document Chunk 1514 ---
bias the bogie to one side and/or to restrict its free movement.

123 This wagon defect is considered to be a factor, since the resulting restricted bogie 

--- Document Chunk 1547 ---
movement possibly explains the uneven flange wear on the right-hand wheels 

--- Document Chunk 1548 ---
of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 and the abnormally high forces that would 

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
be associated with this. The defect is not considered sufficient in itself to have 

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
resulted in the lateral loading needed to cause the derailment. This is evidenced 

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
by the same bogie passing over bridge 456 without derailing on nine previous 

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
occasions in the same month (paragraph 19). 

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---
Uneven payload

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
124 The wagons of train 6Z54 had been weighed when they arrived at Barking 

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
for loading, and again after they were loaded on 23 January 2020. On both 

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---
occasions, the weighing equipment recorded the weight of each wheel. Weighing 

--- Document Chunk 1557 ---
on arrival allowed the amount of residual payload from previous journeys to be 

--- Document Chunk 1558 ---
taken into account when determining the maximum amount of material which 

--- Document Chunk 1559 ---
should be loaded at Barking. Prior to loading on 23 January 2020, the average 

--- Document Chunk 1560 ---
residual payload in each wagon was about 6.6 tonnes and the maximum was 

--- Document Chunk 1561 ---
13.5 tonnes.

--- Document Chunk 1562 ---
125 The wagons were loaded at Barking using a 360° excavator with a weighing 

--- Document Chunk 1563 ---
facility, working from the right-hand side of the train. This method of loading, and 

--- Document Chunk 1564 ---
the nature of the clayey material involved, contributed to the payload in every 

--- Document Chunk 1565 ---
wagon being off-set towards the right-hand side when the train left Barking on 

--- Document Chunk 1566 ---
23 January. Wagon 3415 did not exceed the maximum gross vehicle weight, 

--- Document Chunk 1567 ---
but the load was concentrated towards the rear right corner of the wagon. The 

--- Document Chunk 1568 ---
load on the leading and trailing wheelsets on the trailing bogie weighed 26.4 

--- Document Chunk 1569 ---
tonnes and 25.95 tonnes respectively, both exceeding the 25.4 tonne RA10 limit 

--- Document Chunk 1570 ---
(paragraph 56). In addition, the payload was off-set so that the two right- hand 

--- Document Chunk 1571 ---
wheels on this bogie were carrying over 6 tonnes more than the left-hand wheels 

--- Document Chunk 1572 ---
with a maximum wheel load of 14.9 tonnes, which can be compared to the 

--- Document Chunk 1573 ---
12.7 tonnes carried if the maximum permitted vehicle load is distributed equally 

--- Document Chunk 1574 ---
between all wagon wheels (figure 44). The maximum wheel load is also defined 

--- Document Chunk 1575 ---
by Railway Group Standard GMRT2141 ‘Permissible track forces and resistance 

--- Document Chunk 1576 ---
to derailment and roll-over of railway vehicles’ as not exceeding 124.5 kN. This is 

--- Document Chunk 1577 ---
equivalent to a wheel load of 12.7 tonnes.

126 Industry guidance7 published by the National Freight Safety Group includes the 

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
following advice under the heading ‘Bulk load distribution’:

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
‘Wagons when fully loaded or otherwise are required to operate within 

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
parameters of weight distribution. Unbalanced wagons change the ride 

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
characteristics of a wagon and are likely to have a greater propensity to derail. 

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
As a general rule the more evenly loaded from side to side and end to end the 

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
lower the risk.

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
The side to side placement of the load should be controlled and monitored… In 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
practice parties should target for balanced loading and manage their activities to 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
reduce the potential inadvertent bias generated from loading activities. This can 

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
be achieved by monitoring the performance of their activities (visual or weights 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
recorded) and providing feedback to the staff undertaking the load placement, 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
identifying actions to be taken. The load placement process may require 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
redesign if staff are unable to adjust loading to within the parameters.’

--- Document Chunk 1598 ---
127 RAIB has also analysed wagon loading data for the three preceding journeys. On 

--- Document Chunk 1599 ---
three of the four occasions including 23 January, all wagons were more heavily 

--- Document Chunk 1600 ---
loaded on the right-hand side. The recorded weight exceeded 12.7 tonnes for 

--- Document Chunk 1601 ---
89% of the wheels on the right-hand side of the train on 23 January. Over the four 

--- Document Chunk 1602 ---
journeys, the average was 80%.

--- Document Chunk 1603 ---
128 The magnitude of the payload and its unevenness would have affected the 

--- Document Chunk 1604 ---
vertical loads on the bogie pivot assembly and the side bearers and, as a result, 

--- Document Chunk 1605 ---
the horizontal friction forces acting at each of the various associated contact 

--- Document Chunk 1606 ---
points and surfaces. It is possible that this combined with the behaviour of the 

--- Document Chunk 1607 ---
defective bogie pivot arrangement to exacerbate the restriction on bogie rotation, 

--- Document Chunk 1608 ---
thereby further increasing the lateral forces on the rails.

--- Document Chunk 1609 ---
Underlying factors

--- Document Chunk 1610 ---
129 Network Rail’s inspection and maintenance processes were insufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 1611 ---
rigorous to identify timber deterioration before an unsafe situation 

--- Document Chunk 1612 ---

--- Document Chunk 1613 ---
130 Network Rail manages and monitors the safety of its longitudinal timber assets 

--- Document Chunk 1614 ---

132 The longitudinal timbers course was run by an experienced Network Rail trainer. 

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
The course materials provided an extensive overview of the issues associated 

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
with inspecting and maintaining longitudinal timber systems. The two-day course 

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
was intended to be entirely classroom-based and the syllabus did not include any 

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
practical elements. There was no structured opportunity for delegates to look for 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
rot, wear or damage, and there was no opportunity to practice testing techniques 

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
such as assessing the internal condition of timber by taking drill samples and 

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
sounding with a hammer (listening to the noise made when striking the timber 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
with a hammer). The training was not specific on where or how inspectors should 

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
drill into timbers to detect decay.

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
133 Inspectors are required to assess the remaining life of the timbers, but this is a 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
very subjective assessment - not easy to teach without practical elements, and 

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
dependent on variables including the amount of rail traffic, wheel loadings and 

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
track geometry. The training course included advice on looking for visual signs 

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
of failure starting, although these can be hard to identify in softwood such as the 

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
Douglas Fir used on bridge 456. Assessing the remaining life of a softwood timber 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
was not specifically covered by the training. Some assets, such as earthworks, 

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
use a scoring system to assess asset condition, but there is no similar system for 

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
longitudinal timber inspections.

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
134 Delegates were instructed that they should obtain and review background 

--- Document Chunk 1649 ---
information, including recent track recording vehicle traces, prior to an inspection. 

--- Document Chunk 1650 ---
135 The training course referred to use of the TEF3014 form (paragraph 98), but there 

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
was no guidance on how to complete the form and no guidance on whether the 

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
timber grading (Good/Fair/Poor) should apply to the whole timber or to its worst 

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
part. The course did not refer to the importance of completing the comments and 

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
recommendations section of the report to guide those responsible for reviewing it.

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
136 The techniques available to Network Rail timber inspectors seeking to determine 

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
the internal condition of timbers were limited to sounding with a hammer and 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
taking drill samples. For timbers of this size, the effectiveness of a hammer test 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
is limited, as a timber that made a hollow sound when hit would already be in an 

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
unsafe condition.

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
137 The drill provided to inspectors formed relatively large holes with the potential 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
to introduce water, and so encourage rot, in the inner parts of timbers. Standard 

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
NR/ L2/TRK/3038 (issue 6) therefore limited the use of drills to instances where 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
there were signs of deterioration or other grounds to suspect decay of the timber. 

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
As demonstrated at bridge 456, timbers appearing to be in good condition can 

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
have a good surface concealing a rotten core (paragraph 67).

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
138 The timber specialist commissioned by RAIB to inspect timbers from bridge 456 

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
(paragraphs 62 and 66) concluded that the internal decay in timbers 1L and 2L 

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
should have been detected by an effective inspection regime. The training given 

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
to longitudinal timber inspectors and the techniques available to them when 

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---
undertaking inspections were likely to be insufficient to achieve this.

139 VTG’s processes did not recognise an underlying problem with wagon 

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
3415 despite the unusual distribution and rate of flange wear on some of its 

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
wheelsets.

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
140 The need for frequent replacement of some wheelsets on wagon 3415 and the 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
nature of wheel wear on the trailing bogie provided VTG with an opportunity to 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
recognise a problem requiring consideration as a possible safety issue. However, 

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
the problem was not identified and so VTG did not consider the underlying cause 

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---
and its possible implications for safety. 

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
141 VTG stated that it did not have any specific process for monitoring or identifying 

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
unusual wheel wear patterns. Instead, it relied on the vigilance of the 

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
organisations responsible for maintaining the wagons or supplying the wheelsets 

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
to identify wear patterns which might indicate a significant geometry fault. VTG 

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
provided records of wear patterns for wheelsets fitted to other wagons in the 

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
same train, and RAIB found no other examples of wheel wear occurring as rapidly 

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
as on wagon 3415.

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
142 VTG also stated that uneven wheel flange wear can occur on wagons fitted with 

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
3-piece bogies, such as those fitted to wagon 3415. The wear often occurs when 

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
the bogie needs to steer on sections of track with small radius curves and no 

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
flange lubrication, such as in sidings. Spilt sand and aggregates collecting on the 

--- Document Chunk 1695 ---
track in loading areas can also contribute by grinding the wheelset flanges against 

--- Document Chunk 1696 ---
the rails.

--- Document Chunk 1697 ---
143 Although uneven wheel flange wear is not unusual, significant wear on two 

--- Document Chunk 1698 ---
wheels on the same side of a bogie does appear to be so. Wheel wear data 

--- Document Chunk 1699 ---
provided by VTG for most of the other wagons on the train, measured following 

--- Document Chunk 1700 ---
the accident, showed a variation in flange wear of up to 3 mm when other wheels 

--- Document Chunk 1701 ---
on the same wheelset were compared. However, only wagon 3415 exhibited rapid 

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
flange wear on the same side of both wheelsets on the same bogie. 

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
Observation

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
144 Three wagons on train 6Z54 exceeded the maximum permitted weight.

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
145 Wagon wheel weights measured after loading on 23 January 2020 

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
(paragraph 125) were used by loading staff to calculate the total weight of the 

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
train, and this weight was passed to a member of DB Cargo staff at Barking. They 

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
informed the DB Cargo TOPS office by phone who entered the train’s details 

--- Document Chunk 1709 ---
into TOPS (Total Operations Processing System) which is operated by Network 

--- Document Chunk 1710 ---
Rail for purposes including assisting management and recording freight train 

--- Document Chunk 1711 ---
operations. TOPS carried out some checks before providing output indicating that 

--- Document Chunk 1712 ---
the train was permitted to leave the loading facility. As only the total train weight 

--- Document Chunk 1713 ---
had been provided, TOPS calculated the average weight per wagon, checked that 

--- Document Chunk 1714 ---
this was within the permitted limit, and released the train for departure.

--- Document Chunk 1720 ---
146 On 23 January, train 6Z54 departed from Barking with a total gross weight of 

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
2167 tonnes excluding the locomotive. The maximum theoretical weight for the 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
22 wagons of train 6Z54, each at the maximum permitted weight of 101.6 tonnes, 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
was 2235 tonnes and TOPS released the train on this basis. However, the train 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
was released with three overweight wagons. These were wagons 3114 and 3125 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
positioned directly behind wagon 3415. These weighed 105 tonnes and 105.45 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
tonnes respectively, with the weight concentrated towards the trailing bogie in 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
both cases (figure 44). The other overloaded wagon was the fourth in the train 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
and weighed 102.35 tonnes. All three overloaded wagons were of the JXA type 

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
which are larger vehicles (paragraph 17) and therefore may have appeared to 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
be less full. These three wagons were each carrying a residual payload of at 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
least 10 tonnes on arrival at Barking (paragraph 124). Despite only three wagons 

--- Document Chunk 1732 ---
exceeding the 101.6 tonnes gross weight limit for RA10, uneven loading meant 

--- Document Chunk 1733 ---
that 24 of the 88 individual axles (27%) had loads in excess of 25.4 tonnes, 

--- Document Chunk 1734 ---
and 82 of the 176 individual wheels (46%) had loads in excess of 12.7 tonnes 

--- Document Chunk 1735 ---
(paragraph 125).

--- Document Chunk 1736 ---
147 An alternative way to enter train data into the TOPS system, is to input the total 

--- Document Chunk 1737 ---
weight of each individual wagon. Had this been done on 23 January 2020, TOPS 

--- Document Chunk 1738 ---
would have prevented the train from being released because three wagons 

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
exceeded the maximum permitted weight of 101.6 tonnes (paragraph 18). The 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
total weight of wagon 3415 was 100.15 tonnes and was not sufficient for TOPS to 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
prevent the train commencing its journey. Network Rail has stated that it does not 

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
mandate that weighbridge weights for each wagon are entered into TOPS, but if 

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
overloading is identified, the wagons should be returned to the terminal to allow 

--- Document Chunk 1744 ---
product to be removed.

--- Document Chunk 1745 ---
148 For the journeys on 18, 21 and 22 January, only one wagon in each train 

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
exceeded the 101.6 tonne gross laden weight limit. However, uneven loading 

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
meant that an average of 26% of individual axles exceeded the 25.4 tonne 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
maximum axle weight limit (paragraph 56).

Derailment of a freight train at Bexley, 4 February 1997

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
149 A freight train derailed on Bridge 799, immediately east of Bexley station in 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
south-east London, because of lateral movement of the track on the longitudinal 

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
timbers on the bridge and a resultant widening of the track gauge. The derailment 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
resulted in substantial damage to the viaduct carrying the track. Four members of 

--- Document Chunk 1755 ---
the public who were working in or near the arches under the viaduct were injured.

--- Document Chunk 1756 ---
150 The investigation by HM Railway Inspectorate8 found that the 12th wagon in the 

--- Document Chunk 1757 ---
train was substantially overloaded. It derailed but remained upright. This resulted 

--- Document Chunk 1758 ---
in the forces exerted on the track being on average larger than normal. The train 

--- Document Chunk 1759 ---
was travelling in excess of the speed limit specified for freight trains on the route. 

--- Document Chunk 1760 ---
The investigation also found that the longitudinal timbers of the bridge were 

--- Document Chunk 1761 ---
severely decayed and overdue for replacement.

--- Document Chunk 1774 ---
the RAIB investigation, demonstrated the influence that the leading wheelsets 

--- Document Chunk 1775 ---
had on the gauge presented to the following wheelsets. It showed that, on track 

--- Document Chunk 1776 ---
having poor rail-sleeper lateral restraint, preceding wheelsets progressively widen

the gauge. It also showed how increased flexibility led to increased spreading

Derailment at Angerstein Junction, 2 April 2014 (RAIB Report 11/2015)

--- Document Chunk 1780 ---
152 Two wagons of a nominally empty freight train derailed on the approach to 

--- Document Chunk 1781 ---
Angerstein Junction, near Charlton in south-east London. The wagons derailed 

--- Document Chunk 1782 ---
because the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient 

--- Document Chunk 1783 ---
load to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track. 

--- Document Chunk 1784 ---
The insufficient load was due to a combination of a track defect, an unevenly 

--- Document Chunk 1785 ---
distributed residual payload in the wagon, and an uneven distribution of load 

--- Document Chunk 1786 ---
associated with a twisted bogie.

Derailment at Washwood Heath West Junction, Birmingam, 23 March 2015 (RAIB 

--- Document Chunk 1788 ---
Report 01/2016)

--- Document Chunk 1789 ---
153 One bogie of a wagon in a container train derailed on a set of points as it crossed 

--- Document Chunk 1790 ---
between lines at Washwood Heath West Junction, in Birmingham. The bogie 

--- Document Chunk 1791 ---
ran derailed for 121 metres before rerailing itself as it ran through another set of 

--- Document Chunk 1792 ---
points. The track contained a twist fault of a magnitude which Network Rail’s track 

--- Document Chunk 1793 ---
maintenance standard specified should be rectified within 36 hours. Network Rail 

--- Document Chunk 1794 ---
was not aware of the existence of this fault at the time. 

--- Document Chunk 1795 ---
154 Wagons should be capable of negotiating a track twist of a magnitude which the 

--- Document Chunk 1796 ---
track standard allows to remain in a line open to traffic. When examined after the 

--- Document Chunk 1797 ---
derailment, the liner on the centre pivot of the bogie was found to be worn beyond 

--- Document Chunk 1798 ---
its maintenance limit. The centre pivot liner is made from a plastic material and 

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
is provided to allow relative movement between the body centre pivot and the 

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
bogie. The worn liner had restricted the freedom of the bogie to rotate, increasing 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
its rotational stiffness. Furthermore, it resulted in reduced side bearer clearances, 

--- Document Chunk 1802 ---
increasing wheel unloading in track twist conditions. Both the increased rotational 

--- Document Chunk 1803 ---
stiffness and the increased wheel unloading reduced the wagon’s resistance to 

--- Document Chunk 1804 ---
derailment, causing it to derail when it encountered the track twist on the curved 

--- Document Chunk 1805 ---
track. The worn centre pivot liner had not been identified during maintenance of 

--- Document Chunk 1806 ---
the wagon as the maintenance instructions were unclear about when it should be 

--- Document Chunk 1807 ---
inspected. A check on other wagons in the same fleet revealed that a number of 

--- Document Chunk 1808 ---
other wagons of the same type had experienced a similar degree of centre pivot

liner wear.

155 Two wagons of a freight train derailed on newly laid track at Courthill Loop South 

--- Document Chunk 1818 ---
Junction in Lewisham. The first of the wagons ran derailed, damaging the track, 

--- Document Chunk 1819 ---
then overturned spilling its payload of sand. The RAIB investigation found that 

--- Document Chunk 1820 ---
the derailment occurred because this wagon, which was probably carrying an 

--- Document Chunk 1821 ---
uneven payload, encountered a significant track twist on tightly curved track. This 

--- Document Chunk 1822 ---
resulted in there being insufficient wheel load to prevent its flange climbing over

Failure of a longitudinal timber at bridge 2013, Haringey, August 2017

--- Document Chunk 1825 ---
156 Part of a longitudinal timber from bridge 2013 (St Ann’s Road) in Haringey, north 

--- Document Chunk 1826 ---
London, fell onto the pavement of the street below on another part of the Barking 

--- Document Chunk 1827 ---
to Gospel Oak route. On this bridge, the longitudinal timbers span between 

--- Document Chunk 1828 ---
cross- girders but without a metal deck, so the underside of the timbers is visible 

--- Document Chunk 1829 ---
from beneath the bridge. A member of the public reported the incident to the 

--- Document Chunk 1830 ---
police. There were no injuries.

--- Document Chunk 1831 ---
157 The longitudinal timbers on this bridge had already been identified as being in 

--- Document Chunk 1832 ---
need of renewal, but as this was a relatively long bridge, the work was repeatedly 

--- Document Chunk 1833 ---
deferred due to shortcomings with the arrangements for planning and funding 

--- Document Chunk 1834 ---
the work. RAIB undertook a preliminary examination, but as the incident did not 

--- Document Chunk 1835 ---
appear to be directly associated with the movement of a train, it did not undertake 

--- Document Chunk 1836 ---
a full investigation. However, RAIB highlighted its concerns in a letter to Network 

--- Document Chunk 1837 ---
Rail and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) (Appendix C). 

--- Document Chunk 1838 ---
158 A Network Rail internal investigation found that the affected softwood timber 

--- Document Chunk 1839 ---
had rotted internally to the heartwood, which crushed under load resulting in 

--- Document Chunk 1840 ---
the section of wood detaching. The investigation also found that the route asset 

--- Document Chunk 1841 ---
manager was not informed that the timber required renewal and that detailed 

--- Document Chunk 1842 ---
knowledge of work needing to be done was lost due to the departure of staff. 

--- Document Chunk 1843 ---
159 ORR carried out an intervention and in November 2018, issued a Special 

--- Document Chunk 1844 ---
Track Inspections Intervention Report to Network Rail which addressed the 

--- Document Chunk 1845 ---
management of longitudinal timbers on Anglia route, including factors relating to 

--- Document Chunk 1846 ---
the incident at bridge 2013. The review found that the route conducted no formal 

--- Document Chunk 1847 ---
analysis of inspection information to see trends. The report recommended that the 

--- Document Chunk 1848 ---
route should define in more detail exactly when and where drill samples should be 

--- Document Chunk 1849 ---
taken and when a hammer should be used for sounding.

Summary of conclusions 

--- Document Chunk 1856 ---
Immediate cause 

--- Document Chunk 1857 ---
160 The track was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 6Z54 passed over it 

--- Document Chunk 1858 ---
(paragraph 43).

--- Document Chunk 1859 ---
Causal factors

--- Document Chunk 1860 ---
161 The causal factors were:

--- Document Chunk 1861 ---
a. the rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide 

--- Document Chunk 1862 ---
gauge (paragraph 49, see action already taken (paragraph 171) hence no 

--- Document Chunk 1863 ---
recommendation, Learning point 1)

--- Document Chunk 1864 ---
b. track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived from 

--- Document Chunk 1865 ---
this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the correct 

--- Document Chunk 1866 ---
location (paragraph 74, Recommendation 1)

--- Document Chunk 1867 ---
c. Network Rail was not aware of the severity of the longitudinal timber 

--- Document Chunk 1868 ---
degradation and so took no action to deal with this (paragraph 95, see action 

--- Document Chunk 1869 ---
already taken (paragraphs 171 to 173) hence no recommendation, Learning 

--- Document Chunk 1870 ---
point 2)

--- Document Chunk 1871 ---
d. the condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high 

--- Document Chunk 1872 ---
lateral loading on the track (paragraph 111) due to a combination of the 

--- Document Chunk 1873 ---
following:

--- Document Chunk 1874 ---
i. a defect on wagon 3415 (paragraph 113, Recommendation 2)

--- Document Chunk 1875 ---
ii. uneven payload (paragraph 124, Learning point 3).

--- Document Chunk 1876 ---
Underlying factors 

--- Document Chunk 1877 ---
162 The underlying factors were:

--- Document Chunk 1878 ---
a. Network Rail’s inspection and maintenance processes were insufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 1879 ---
rigorous to identify timber deterioration before an unsafe situation 

--- Document Chunk 1880 ---
developed (paragraph 129, action already taken (paragraph 172) hence no 

--- Document Chunk 1881 ---
recommendation)

--- Document Chunk 1882 ---
b. VTG’s processes did not recognise an underlying problem with the wagon or 

--- Document Chunk 1883 ---
bogie despite the unusual distribution and rate of flange wear on the wheels 

--- Document Chunk 1884 ---
on some of its wheelsets (paragraph 139, Recommendation 2).

--- Document Chunk 1885 ---
Observation

--- Document Chunk 1886 ---

Previous RAIB recommendations relevant to this

investigation 

--- Document Chunk 1895 ---
164 The following recommendations, which were made by RAIB as a result of its 

--- Document Chunk 1896 ---
previous investigations, have relevance to this investigation.

--- Document Chunk 1897 ---
Freight train derailment at Angerstein Junction, 2 April 2014 (RAIB report 11/2015), 

--- Document Chunk 1898 ---
published August 2015

--- Document Chunk 1899 ---
165 Recommendation 5 of the RAIB report into the derailment at Angerstein Junction 

--- Document Chunk 1900 ---
is relevant to the Wanstead Park derailment because it relates to the detection 

--- Document Chunk 1901 ---
of incorrectly loaded wagons. The intention of this recommendation was to 

--- Document Chunk 1902 ---
encourage use of available monitoring data from wheel impact load detection 

--- Document Chunk 1903 ---
systems, such as Gotcha, to inform rolling stock maintenance.

--- Document Chunk 1904 ---
Network Rail should review the potential to use wheel impact load detection 

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
system data to provide information about possible defects, such as uneven 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
wheel loading or uneven load distribution, relating to specific wagons. The 

--- Document Chunk 1907 ---
review should include cosideration of how this information could be used to 

--- Document Chunk 1908 ---
improve control of overall derailment risk (such as identifying the need for 

--- Document Chunk 1909 ---
entities in charge of maintenance to check the condition of suspect wagons and 

--- Document Chunk 1910 ---
take appropriate remedial action). Network Rail should seek inputs from relevant 

--- Document Chunk 1911 ---
entities in charge of maintenance as part of the review. If justified by the review, 

--- Document Chunk 1912 ---
Network Rail should implement track side and reporting processes needed for 

--- Document Chunk 1913 ---
collecting and disseminating this information.

--- Document Chunk 1914 ---
166 Recommendation 6 is also relevant:

RSSB, in consultation with industry, should review the risks associated with 

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---
the uneven loading of wagons, with particular reference to partial loads, 

--- Document Chunk 1917 ---
and propose any necessary mitigation, so that the extent of permitted load

171 Following several incidents on Anglia route, including the failure of part of a timber 

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
at bridge 2013 in August 2017 (paragraph 156), Network Rail commenced a 

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
detailed review of how it manages its longitudinal timber systems. Actions taken 

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
on Anglia route as a result of this review have included:

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
a. creating a new role of senior asset engineer (track structures) to centralise 

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
responsibility for managing the process of inspecting and renewing 

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
longitudinal timber systems and to provide support for team leaders based at 

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
depots and responsible for longitudinal timbers

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
b. instructing TMEs to provide reports to the senior asset engineer (track 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
structures) for all longitudinal timber structures requiring renewal within three 

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
years so that the asset engineer can check that the correct priority has been 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
assigned

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
c. introducing a four-weekly meeting between the senior asset engineer (track 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
structures), track renewals engineer and structures engineer to co-ordinate the 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
work of the delivery teams.

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
172 In March 2020, Network Rail published issue 7 of standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
‘Longitudinal Bearer Systems – Inspection, Maintenance and Design’. Issuing 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
the significantly updated standard was already at an advanced stage when 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
the accident occurred at bridge 456. The new version of the standard provides 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
additional guidance for staff and introduces a new TEF 3279 Long Bearer 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
Management Plan for each structure. This requires provision of photographs and 

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---
sketches and is intended to exist as a live document, being updated when work 

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
is completed. After each detailed examination TEF3279 shall be reviewed and, if 

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
necessary, revised by the TME and the section manager (track). The Long Bearer 

--- Document Chunk 1975 ---
Management Plan requires a structure specific risk assessment of the frequency 

--- Document Chunk 1976 ---
at which any walkways should be lifted.

--- Document Chunk 1977 ---
Standard 3038 (issue 7) also includes:

--- Document Chunk 1978 ---
a. advice on factors to consider when establishing the year of expiry of the 

--- Document Chunk 1979 ---
bearers (module 2, clause 5.7)

--- Document Chunk 1980 ---
b. the requirement for examinations to include drainage and ventilation 

--- Document Chunk 1981 ---
arrangements (module 2, clause 5.4)

--- Document Chunk 1982 ---
c. the requirement that non-destructive and intrusive testing shall include the 

--- Document Chunk 1983 ---
use of an approved microdrill [a very small diameter drill to avoid drilling large 

--- Document Chunk 1984 ---
holes in timbers]

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
d. a reminder that the internal condition of the timber can be poor even if the 

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
surface is good (module 2, Clause 5.5)

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
e. a requirement that staff responsible for inspecting longitudinal timber systems 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
should be provided with information on recently recorded track faults in 

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
advance of their inspection.

173 Network Rail has notified RAIB that it is updating its training syllabus to 

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
accompany the roll-out of issue 7 of standard NR/L2/TRK/3038. The full course 

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
will be delivered to staff learning to undertake longitudinal timber inspections. 

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
Staff who already hold the competency and are currently responsible for 

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---
undertaking these inspections will receive training on new and updated elements. 

--- Document Chunk 2000 ---
The specification for the new course includes measures to address the following 

--- Document Chunk 2001 ---
gaps identified by RAIB during this investigation:

--- Document Chunk 2002 ---
a. how to grade the timber as Good / Fair / Poor ratings and link this to estimated 

--- Document Chunk 2003 ---
remaining life, taking account of site conditions

--- Document Chunk 2004 ---
b. how to complete the TEF3014 form (including the importance of highlighting 

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
key findings in the summary of the inspection report so that the need for any 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
action is identified).

Recommendations and learning points

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
Recommendations

--- Document Chunk 2014 ---
174 The following recommendations are made:9

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
1 The intent of this recommendation is to reduce the risk that track 

--- Document Chunk 2016 ---
maintenance staff miss defects identified by track recording vehicles; it is 

--- Document Chunk 2017 ---
likely that work already started by Network Rail will assist implementation 

--- Document Chunk 2018 ---
of this recommendation.

--- Document Chunk 2019 ---
 Network Rail should take measures to improve the clarity of information 

--- Document Chunk 2020 ---
provided from Track Recording Vehicle systems, and the procedures 

--- Document Chunk 2021 ---
adopted by those investigating defects, to assist track maintenance staff 

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
to correctly locate all recorded defects. The improvements shall include 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
consideration of: 

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
l ways of identifying discrete defects when these occur within one area 

--- Document Chunk 2025 ---
of relatively poor track quality where multiple defects are currently 

--- Document Chunk 2026 ---
reported as a single defect at one location due to the ‘hysteresis 

--- Document Chunk 2027 ---
threshold’ feature of the track recording vehicle system

--- Document Chunk 2028 ---
l the extent to which staff should look for defects beyond a nominal 

--- Document Chunk 2029 ---
defect position due to inaccuracies in locations determined using 

--- Document Chunk 2030 ---
global positioning system (GPS) equipment (paragraph 161).

--- Document Chunk 2031 ---
2 The intent of this recommendation is to reduce the risk of defective rail 

--- Document Chunk 2032 ---
vehicles entering service; it is likely that work already started by VTG will 

--- Document Chunk 2033 ---
assist implementation of this recommendation.

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---
 VTG should review and improve monitoring of maintenance activities 

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
on individual rail wagons to detect repetitive maintenance requirements 

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
which may indicate an underlying fault which is not being addressed 

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
(paragraph 162b).

--- Document Chunk 2038 ---
 This recommendation may apply to other Entities in Charge of 

--- Document Chunk 2039 ---
Maintenance. 

--- Document Chunk 2040 ---
9 Those identified in the recommendations have a general and ongoing obligation to comply with health and safety 

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
legislation, and need to take these recommendations into account in ensuring the safety of their employees and 

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
others. 

--- Document Chunk 2043 ---
Additionally, for the purposes of regulation 12(1) of the Railways (Accident Investigation and Reporting) Regulations 

--- Document Chunk 2044 ---
2005, these recommendations are addressed to the Office of Rail and Road to enable it to carry out its duties under 

--- Document Chunk 2045 ---
regulation 12(2) to: 

--- Document Chunk 2046 ---
(a) ensure that recommendations are duly considered and where appropriate acted upon; and 

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
(b) report back to RAIB details of any implementation measures, or the reasons why no implementation 

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
measures are being taken.

--- Document Chunk 2049 ---

Learning points

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---
175 RAIB has identified the following important learning points:10

--- Document Chunk 2058 ---
1 Staff involved with management of longitudinal timber systems 

--- Document Chunk 2059 ---
constructed from softwood are reminded that these may lose significant 

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
strength before decay or degradation becomes clearly visible on the 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
surface (paragraph 161).

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
2 The importance of providing longitudinal timbers with an environment 

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---
which is free from standing water, well ventilated and fully visible to staff 

--- Document Chunk 2064 ---
carrying out inspections (paragraph 161).

--- Document Chunk 2065 ---
3 Freight terminal operators and freight operating companies are reminded 

--- Document Chunk 2066 ---
of the importance of avoiding over-loaded or unevenly loaded wagons 

--- Document Chunk 2067 ---
as addressed by the National Freight Safety Group code of practice 

--- Document Chunk 2068 ---
‘Loading bulk wagons’ NFSG-COP-004. This should include:

--- Document Chunk 2069 ---
l allowing for any residual payloads from previous journeys

--- Document Chunk 2070 ---
l adopting loading techniques which reduce any tendency to fill wagons 

--- Document Chunk 2071 ---
unevenly

--- Document Chunk 2072 ---
l using wagon weighing data and Gotcha monitoring system data to 

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
identify uneven loading (paragraphs 161 and 163).

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
10 ‘Learning points’ are intended to disseminate safety learning that is not covered by a recommendation. They are 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
included in a report when RAIB wishes to reinforce the importance of compliance with existing safety arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
(where RAIB has not identified management issues that justify a recommendation) and the consequences of failing 

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
to do so. They also record good practice and actions already taken by industry bodies that may have a wider 

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
application.

Dear 

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
Partial loss of track support, bridge 2013, St Ann’s Road, Haringey, 26 August 2017 

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
I am writing to advise you of the outcome of the RAIB’s preliminary examination into an 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
incident that occurred at St Ann’s Road, Haringey overnight on 25/26 August 2017. A large 

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
piece of timber was found under the bridge by a member of the public (figure 1), and was 

--- Document Chunk 2140 ---
reported to Network Rail by the Metropolitan Police. The wood was part of an unsupported 

--- Document Chunk 2141 ---
longitudinal timber (ie there was no supporting deck plate) carrying the 6 foot rail of the up line 

--- Document Chunk 2142 ---
which had rotted. Network Rail staff initially imposed a 5 mph emergency speed restriction, but 

--- Document Chunk 2143 ---
the line was later blocked when track maintenance staff determined that the timber had to be 

--- Document Chunk 2144 ---
renewed. The remaining section of the timber was found to have rotted through from the top 

--- Document Chunk 2145 ---
and it disintegrated as it was being removed from the bridge on 28 August (figure 2). Sections 

--- Document Chunk 2146 ---
examined by the RAIB on 30 August were found to be spongy and wet.

November 2020

--- Document Chunk 2151 ---
The current longitudinal timbers on bridge 2013 were installed in about 1986 with a 20 year 

--- Document Chunk 2152 ---
service life. By 2012, their condition had deteriorated to the extent that the Barking Track 

--- Document Chunk 2153 ---
Maintenance Engineer proposed that the timbers be renewed. 

--- Document Chunk 2154 ---
Longitudinal timber systems, because of their vulnerability, are subject to annual inspections in 

--- Document Chunk 2155 ---
accordance with Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/3038. The last three TEF3014 long timber 

--- Document Chunk 2156 ---
examination reports for this bridge have marked the timbers as ‘red’, meaning replacement 

--- Document Chunk 2157 ---
required in 1-12 months. The length of the bridge meant that this activity exceeded the 

--- Document Chunk 2158 ---
capability of the local delivery unit and required funding from the CAPEX budget. The RAIB 

--- Document Chunk 2159 ---
understands that, prior to the incident, this renewal work was planned for 2019. 

--- Document Chunk 2160 ---
Prior to the line reopening after an eight month electrification blockade in February 2017, the 

--- Document Chunk 2161 ---
newly-appointed Infrastructure Maintenance engineer (IME) sent an email to the RAM [Track] 

--- Document Chunk 2162 ---
proposing that advantage be taken of the blockade to gain access and renew timbers. The 

--- Document Chunk 2163 ---
RAM [Track] did not take the proposal forward, apparently due to budget constraints. The line 

--- Document Chunk 2164 ---
reopened with tie bars fitted and a 20 mph emergency speed restriction. The poor condition 

--- Document Chunk 2165 ---
of the longitudinal timbers is illustrated in a photograph dated January 2017 (figure 3) which 

--- Document Chunk 2166 ---
shows the disintegration of the top surface.

--- Document Chunk 2167 ---
Figure 3: photograph dated January 2017 Figure 4: damaged timber from below. Daylight is 

--- Document Chunk 2168 ---
visible.

--- Document Chunk 2169 ---
A structures visual examination report dated March 2017 identified that urgent attention 

--- Document Chunk 2170 ---
was required to replace the severely decayed wheel-timbers. This concern was raised by 

--- Document Chunk 2171 ---
the examiner even though longitudinal timbers are not deemed a structures asset. The IME 

--- Document Chunk 2172 ---
forwarded a copy of this report to the RAM [Track] to reinforce his request that action be 

--- Document Chunk 2173 ---
taken. The most recent supervisor’s inspection in August 2017 also categorised the affected 

--- Document Chunk 2174 ---
timber as ‘poor’. 

--- Document Chunk 2175 ---
It is apparent that numerous warnings were raised about the deterioration of the longitudinal 

--- Document Chunk 2176 ---
timbers on this bridge. In view of the similarities with the 1997 Bexley derailment which was 

--- Document Chunk 2177 ---
caused by significant deterioration to the track support and fastenings, I would like to draw 

--- Document Chunk 2178 ---
your attention to the following aspects of this event:

--- Document Chunk 2179 ---
1. The RAM [Track] did not approve work to renew the longitudinal timbers. The RAIB has 

--- Document Chunk 2180 ---
not sought to establish why, but observes that as the longitudinal timbers on bridge 2013 

--- Document Chunk 2181 ---
were un-supported (ie there was no deck plate beneath the timbers - figure 4), so were 

--- Document Chunk 2182 ---
required to have the strength necessary to carry and transfer rail traffic loading to the 

--- Document Chunk 2183 ---
supporting structure.

--- Document Chunk 2184 ---
2. A review, required by standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 when the tonnage of traffic using a 

--- Document Chunk 2185 ---
longitudinal timber bridge was expected to increase significantly, either did not occur, or 

--- Document Chunk 2186 ---
did not identify that work was urgently required.

3. It would appear that the sponsors of the electrification project either did not identify, or did 

--- Document Chunk 2194 ---
not promote/support work which essential for the project’s own success. This is surprising, 

--- Document Chunk 2195 ---
as the scope of the project included bridgeworks elsewhere on the line.

--- Document Chunk 2196 ---
The RAIB has decided to take no further action in respect of this incident. However, given 

--- Document Chunk 2197 ---
the apparent safety management issues it raises, we advise Network Rail to take the above 

--- Document Chunk 2198 ---
points into account when concluding their own investigation and developing recommendations 

--- Document Chunk 2199 ---
to prevent a reoccurrence. I am copying this letter to the Office of Rail and Road for their
