(This document is intended for candidates taking Module A of the IRSE Professional Examination.  Some content comes from the IRSE Metro Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
Systems textbook) 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
Rail based public transport covers a wide spectrum ranging from tramways with little or no signalling to high speed lines with cab signalling and full 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
automatic train protection.  Within that range, this comparison seeks to summarise the main differences between a typical metro and a typical main line 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
railway.  The main line railway is assumed to be a mixed traffic network of lines (express passenger, suburban or local passenger & freight).  The metro is 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
taken to be a “mass transit” railway with high passenger flows and some underground sections such as exist in many large cities globally.  It can also be 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
known as the underground, subway, or tube. 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
The document also outlines the various degrees of automation applied to metros worldwide.

Summary of differences 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
Metro railway Main line railway 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
Traffic patterns  

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
High frequency service, particularly in city centres.  Frequency of more 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
than 30 trains per hour can be achieved. 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
Very wide range of frequencies though not as high as the most frequent 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
metros. 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
High capacity capable of transporting up to 50,000 passengers per hour. High capacity can be delivered, usually with longer, less frequent trains. 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
Trains nearly always stop at all stations Variable stopping patterns to accommodate express and stopping trains.  

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
This has an adverse effect on capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
Does not share tracks with freight or inter-city type services, but some 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
systems share some sections of route with suburban trains. 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
The same tracks are used by express passenger, suburban passenger & 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
freight trains. 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
Station stops are often close together Station stops can be very widely separated. 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
Passenger management  

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
Carry large numbers of people over relatively short distances in city 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
centres and the surrounding areas.  Managing passenger flows within 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
stations is an important consideration. 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
Typically longer journeys with lower passenger densities at stations.  

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
Passenger management is only critical in locations with high passenger 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
densities. 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
Headway & Capacity  

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
Station dwell times are minimised because at high frequencies on an 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
existing system, this is the most significant limiting factor on capacity.  

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
More and wider train doors tend to reduce dwell time. 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
Station dwell times are less critical on most routes. 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
When designing a new metro line, higher capacity trains (e.g. more cars, 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
fewer seats) will increase passenger capacity.  High acceleration and 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
braking rates are more important ways of increasing capacity than high 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
maximum speeds. 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
The same principles apply, but are only significant where there are high 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
passenger densities.   

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
Terminal station layouts and procedures are designed to deliver rapid train 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
turnrounds to maximise the train frequency for the number of platforms.  

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
The number of platforms can be a major constraint on line capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
Relatively long layovers at terminal stations are usual. 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
Fixed block is widespread, but with short track circuit sections carefully 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
designed to optimise capacity.  Moving block is used by modern CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
systems to increase capacity and shorten signalling headway by reducing 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
the allowed train separation as the following train slows down. 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
Fixed block is the norm.  Moving block is enabled by the highest level of 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
ETCS (not yet widely implemented), but this is less valuable in increasing 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
capacity where different types of train share the same tracks.

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
Safety  

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
More frequent service increases collision risk.  Collisions in tunnels have 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
the potential for very serious consequences.  Automatic Train Protection 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
(ATP) to prevent collisions is considered essential on most lines. 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
ATP is typically integrated within modern systems such as CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
Higher speeds increase the potential consequences of a collision or 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
derailment (though there are far fewer tunnels).  A wide variety of ATP 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
systems exist and are commonly used.  ATP is typically integrated within 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
modern systems such as ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
Fire or smoke are more dangerous in a tunnel, resulting in many metros 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
implementing their own specific approvals regimes to manage the risk 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
posed by equipment deployed in these locations. 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
The same applies, but there are far fewer tunnels.  

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
High passenger numbers mean that controls need to be applied in the 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
event of service disruption (e.g. by temporary station closure).  Platform 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
screen doors are often provided on new metros. 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
This only applies where there are high passenger densities. 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
Reliable and audible public address (both on trains and in stations) is vital 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
to maintain passenger safety during emergencies and service disruption.  

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
Robust voice communications between the control centre and the train 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
driver (or attendant) is vital too. 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
Important, but less critical except where there are high passenger 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
densities. 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
Evacuation of passengers in tunnels is difficult, particularly if there is no 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
side walkway. As a result, many metros include specific evacuation shafts 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
at certain locations.  These are typically equipped with systems to support 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
the evacuation of passengers under the supervision of operational staff 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
and the emergency services. 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
The same applies, but very little of the network is in tunnel. 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
Control system  

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
Modern systems use Communication Based Train Control (CBTC).  

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
Currently systems from different equipment suppliers are not 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
interoperable.  This is not a big compatibility issue because most metro 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
lines are self-contained.  Lineside signals are not necessary for normal 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
operations, but are sometimes installed (e.g. backup, running of trains that 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
are not CBTC fitted) 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
Most modern systems without lineside signalling use the European Train 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
Control System (ETCS) or a near equivalent.  There is a common 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
specification such that systems from different equipment suppliers are 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
interoperable (i.e. each train only needs one set of equipment to 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
communicate with any ETCS fitted infrastructure).  Positive Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
(PTC) in North America has similar functions.

Automation  

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
Increasing use of high levels of automation, up to and including driverless 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
and unattended operation.  Elimination of lineside signals.  Attended 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
operation enables automated driving, but provides an on-board human 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
presence to manage passenger safety and/or manually drive the train in 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
the event of failure. 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
See Automation section below for more details. 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
Increasing use of automation to support the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
Automatic Train Operation (ATO) can improve capacity by consistently 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
driving every train in a way which minimises transit times between 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
stations.  This means that recovery margins do not need to allow for the 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
differing driving styles of a large number of drivers. 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
The same principles apply, but are only significant where there are high 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
passenger densities.   

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
Data communications  

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
Combination of highly directional aerials and radiating cables (leaky 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
feeders) to communicate between control centre and trains in tunnels.  

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
TETRA radio and Wi-Fi with robust coding are the commonly used systems.  

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
These systems are sometimes used to provide train fault reporting data 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
(often routed directly to the rolling stock maintenance location) and 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
customer information system updates.   

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
Similar technology used in tunnels.  GSM-R is the current standard in 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
Europe for secure communications with trains. 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
Metro railway Main line railway 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
Voice communications  

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
TETRA radio is the most commonly used system providing voice 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
communication: 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
- Between control centres and trains 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
- For station staff 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
- For maintenance staff 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
- For incident response teams 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
Note that TETRA radio base stations are capable of continuing to provide 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
local service to radio users in the event of disconnection from or failure of 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
the wider network.  This resilience is a key feature of their role within 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
operational management of the station (particularly at large underground 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
locations). 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
GSM-R is the current standard in Europe for secure communications with 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
trains, usually supplemented with track side telephones deployed at 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
appropriate locations. 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
Station radio is often provided by separate local spot systems rather than 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
using the GSM-R network. 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
Emergency Services radio system coverage is often provided throughout all 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
underground locations (stations, tunnels and evacuation shafts).  This is 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
typically achieved by connecting dedicated emergency services radio 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
equipment to the metro’s coverage infrastructure. 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
Emergency Service radio coverage is provided at key locations where a 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
risk assessment has identified it as necessary, for example long tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
sections.  This may be provided on its own dedicated infrastructure or 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
using existing railway coverage infrastructure if appropriate. 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
Stopping distances  

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
Relatively slow speeds, high braking performance and uniform rolling stock 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
mean that stopping distances can be quite short.  This enables a high 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
frequency of service. 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
Higher speeds and the variety of train types (including freight) mean that 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
the signalling system needs to allow for long stopping distances on mixed 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
traffic lines. 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
Signals & Overlaps  

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
Short stopping distances mean that lineside stop signals do not always 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
have to be preceded by a caution signal providing the sighting distance is 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
sufficient 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
Lineside stop signals are almost always preceded by at least one caution 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
signal.

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
Dependability  

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
Given the effect on trains and on passenger management of even short 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
duration failures, very high levels of system reliability and availability are 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
required.  Robust hardware, equipment redundancy (duplication), remote 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
condition monitoring and fast system recovery can all be used to achieve 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
this.  Fallback capabilities to maintain operations also need to be able to be 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
implemented quickly. 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
These factors are important, but less critical apart from the most densely 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
used sections of the network. 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
Infrastructure  

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
Often in tunnels or overhead viaducts, particularly in city centres.  Tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
lengths can be very long. 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
A very small proportion of route is in tunnels.  Most are quite short, 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
except where the routes pass through major mountain ranges or under 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
the sea. 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
Grade separated junctions (e.g. flyovers) are the norm in the areas of the 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
highest frequency traffic to increase capacity by avoiding conflicting 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
routes. 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
Similar considerations apply in the areas of highest frequency traffic, but 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
the majority of junctions are “flat” to avoid expensive civil engineering 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
works and greater land take. 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
Usually completely independent of road or pedestrian traffic.  Trains are 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
typically too frequent to allow realistic opportunities for crossing the 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
railway. 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
Level (grade) crossings for road or pedestrian movements across the 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
railway are common on many lines. 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
Traction  

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
Electric for avoidance of air pollution and for high acceleration with high 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
performance motors.  Regenerative braking for lower heat gain in tunnels 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
and energy economy. 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
Mostly electric or diesel.  Benefits of regenerative braking are greatest on 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
electrified lines with frequent services so that other trains can use the 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
electricity generated.

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
Automation 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
Grades of Automation 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
Metros can be designed to operate under several degrees of automation, ranging from nil (now unusual except for systems operating like 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
tramways) to full automation (with no staff member on the train).  These are described by a number of Grades of Automation (GoA). 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
The automation functions (ATP, ATO, ATS) are described below. 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
Automatic Train Protection (ATP) 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
The ATP sub-system delivers the limit of movement authority to each train.  This determines where the train is permitted to travel based on the routes set 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
by the interlocking and the position of other trains. The ATP supervises train movements and ensures that they only occur on authorised routes, in the 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
correct direction and within the limits of the movement authority. The ATP ensures the safety of all train movements, irrespective of whether train control 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
is from the Automatic Train Operation sub-system or the train operator (driver). The primary ATP functions are as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
 Trackside ATP equipment, most commonly found in signalling equipment rooms at stations and/or at control centres 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
o Train location tracking 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
o Movement authority determination to ensure safe train separation 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
o Temporary speed restriction application 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
o Emergency train evacuation supervision 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
o Interlock train movement with platform screen doors, staff protection key switches (work zone protection) and platform emergency stop 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
plungers 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
 Train borne ATP equipment 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
o Determine the position of the train and report to the trackside ATP 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
o Determine the status of the ATP sub-system health and which driving modes are available (manual, automatic etc.) 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
o Ensure the train does not exceed the movement authority limit 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
o Ensure that train does not exceed the permanent or temporary speed restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
o Train direction supervision 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
o Correct side door enabling at platforms (door open control protection interlocks) 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
o Supervise emergency train evacuation 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
o Ensure all doors closed and locked prior to station departure. 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
 Track-mounted ATP sub-system 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
o Equipment mounted on the track (such as beacons/transponders) to provide a positioning reference; also used by the ATO equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
Automatic Train Operation (ATO) 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
This is the sub-system that drives the train between stations within the constraints established by the ATP sub-system. The functionality of the ATO will vary 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
depending upon the grade of automation. For GoA4 metros where no train operator is present, all functions performed by the train operator on a GoA1 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
metro are performed by the ATO sub-system.  The ATO functions include: 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
 Driving the train from station to station obeying permanent and temporary speed restrictions within the movement authority provided by the ATP 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
 Train door and platform screen door open and closing 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
 Platform dwell time management 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
 Apply applicable energy saving driving strategies  

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
 Jog, realigning an incorrectly stopped train to within the specified ATP door opening tolerance. 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
 Selecting the appropriate driving profile for the line type, such as surface tunnel, wet etc. 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
 Applying platform hold, train hold and station skip commands 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
Signalling and train control facilities in metro depots often are not provided, or they are very simple.   However, it is becoming common on modern metro 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
systems (and in particular on driverless/unattended metro systems) to deploy the same signalling solution in depots as on the rest of the line to provide 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
ATP and ATO functions.  This could include, for example: 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
 Automatic routing of trains to and from storage tracks, to permit efficient scheduled and “on-demand” service build ups and reductions 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
 Automatic close-up of trains on storage tracks 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
 Automatic coupling and uncoupling of trains 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
 Automatic cycling of trains through train inspection facilities or exterior car wash facilities. 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
The ATS sub-system is responsible for the overall line control function.  It is located at the control centre and it presents the state of the railway to the 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
operators.  It controls the trains, but the operators can intervene when the service deviates beyond the recovery capability of the ATS sub-system.  

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
The primary functions of the ATS sub-system are as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
 Issue commands to the interlocking and other sub-systems to route trains to their destinations.  

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
 Display the state of the railway to the operator, tracking trains and displaying the signalling equipment status. 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
 Service regulation, adjusting the service to keep to the timetable or to equalise the interval between trains. 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
 Provide the user interface for operators to adjust the service when needed 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
 Alarm management 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
 Provision of service information to customer information systems 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
 Logging and playback for incident investigation. 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
Failure of the ATS sub-system should not directly affect the safety of passengers. 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
Automation benefits 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
The benefits of the various degrees of automation include the following: 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
 Automation of the train driving functions can provide for more regular and predictable run times between stations, eliminating the variations 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
inherent with manual driving.  This can enable higher line capacity by reducing recovery margins which partly allow for different driving styles. 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
 Driverless and unattended train operation, with automatic passenger door opening and closing and with automatic train departure from station 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
platforms, can further reduce the variations in line operation. 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
 Unattended train operation frees the metro operator of the constraints imposed by the need to roster train crews.  It also provides the flexibility to 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
operate shorter trains more frequently.  This makes it easier to respond to variations in demand throughout the day, while still delivering a frequent 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
service. 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
 Unattended train operation, when combined with fully automated maintenance yards and stabling tracks, provides the flexibility to respond to 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
unexpected increases in passenger demands by adding additional trains to the service, all without requiring additional train drivers or manual 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
intervention. 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
 Lower operating costs for driverless trains. 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
 Automation of turnback at terminal stations can reduce turnover times, reducing the number of train sets needed for operation. 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
 Automation of train regulation, train dispatching and train routing functions can more effectively regulate the performance of trains in relation to 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
timetable (schedule) and headway adherence.  Regulation (e.g. to equalise the time interval between successive trains) can be achieved by 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
automatically adjusting dwell times and/or by automatically controlling run times between stations (e.g., through adjustments to train acceleration 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
and service brake rates, and speeds). 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
 Automation of train regulation functions can minimise overall system delays by optimising the scheduling of each train. 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
 The automatic, real-time control and coordination of train acceleration, train coasting, and train braking can also be utilised to implement energy 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
optimisation algorithms, for example though coasting controls or by synchronising the acceleration of one train with the braking of another train to 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
maximise use of brake energy recovery. 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
 Automated failure detection and response can be more effective in responding to system disturbances and emergencies through the elimination of 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
human error. 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
There are some drawbacks to set against the benefits above. 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
 Increased staff costs for any additional passenger service and security personnel 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
 Additional capital and maintenance costs associated with the automation system itself 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
 Additional costs arising from contingency arrangements to deal with failures and emergencies on unattended systems.   

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
Control Systems 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
These range from systems with lineside signals observed by a driver to ones with full automation and no drivers.  Three common systems are described 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
below.  The more advanced systems will typically be able to deliver higher line capacity (i.e. more trains per hour) 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
Lineside Signals with fixed block working 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
The diagram below illustrates the headway that can be achieved with 2 aspect signalling. 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
Cab Signalling with Coded Track Circuits 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
With cab signalling, headway is no longer constrained by the distance between lineside signals.  Shorter headways can be achieved by the subdivision of a 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
signal block into shorter sections.  Train speed is detected and controlled separately in each of these short sections, thus enabling shorter headways and 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
greater line capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
The track is divided into predetermined short track circuit lengths and each track can be fed with any one of a number of codes, each code signifying a 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
maximum safe speed, target speed, or for some metro systems, both the maximum safe speed and target speed.   

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
The appropriate code for each track circuit is determined by the nearby interlocking depending upon the position of track occupancy ahead of any train, or 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
the requirement for junction or other speed restriction.  Modern systems typically use audio frequency signals to convey a specific command. 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
A train traversing a track circuit picks up the coded signal from the transmitter via an antenna.  The signal is decoded, and the actual train speed is 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
compared with the decoded track signal to determine if the train is above or below the authorised speed.  

--- Document Chunk 338 ---

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
Example of ATP code sequence in a track circuit based speed code system 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
If the train speed is excessive the driver must reduce the speed to below the authorised speed or be subjected to an emergency brake action, generally to a

standstill.  A typical arrangement is shown in the diagram above in which it can be seen that if the train is driven in accordance with the Target Speed 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
indications, it will be brought to a stop with one track circuit between it and the preceding train. Should the train fail to operate below the Maximum Safe 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
Speed profile at any time (and no corrective action is taken) the train will be automatically brought to a stop within or before the 0/0 code track circuit. As a 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
train moves from block to block, the codes step up in the blocks behind.

Moving Block Signalling (loop & radio-based systems) 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
Moving block systems provided by Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) systems are now the preferred metro train control technology. The principle 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
of a moving block system is that each train moves within its own allocated block.  A limit of movement authority is issued to the train which defines the 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
point beyond which the train must not go.  This is usually the end of the route or the rear of the train ahead, whichever is encountered first. There is a 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
safety margin to account for rollback and errors in train location reporting. As the preceding train moves, so does the block, hence the name. The length of 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
the block depends on the braking distance of the following train, so (unlike a fixed block system with lineside signals) a train can safely come to a stop very 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
close to the rear of a stationary train.

 Moving block signalling train separation 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
Moving block systems do not need traditional train detection sub-systems such as track circuits or axle counters, but some do have them to support mixed-

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
mode operations or to facilitate system recovery following a train location determination failure. Moving block systems require continuous communications 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
between the train and trackside to receive train position reports and provide updated movement authorities.  Two solutions are currently in use, inductive 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
loops and radio. 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
Fully automatic trains 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
There are no technical reasons why trains cannot be driven fully automatically without the need for any manual intervention on board trains.  The economic 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
and operational benefits of fully automatic operation are significant, largely due to the greater degree of flexibility in scheduling trains without the need for 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
arranging for drivers to be present at the correct time and place.   

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
Trains equipped with a continuous form of ATP and ATO are capable of operating safely and efficiently with minimal action by drivers or attendants.  Generally 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
the role of the staff is to ensure that alighting passengers are clear of closing doors prior to train departure from stations and/or opening train doors on arrival 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
at stations.  Such functions can be automated, provided that equipment is installed to fulfil these roles safely and provide passengers with information which 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
may have been provided had a driver been present.  Such equipment may include: 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
 additional CCTV equipment on station platforms to ensure passenger safety; 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
 on track obstruction detection equipment in-station areas (infra-red or radar systems); 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
Mod.A Metro differences v5.docx 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
 platform screen doors; 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
 bi-directional voice communication between train passengers and control centre; 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
 additional train systems monitoring and reporting equipment for diagnostic purposes. 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
However a trained human presence on the train can deal with failures and emergencies (e.g. by manual driving or passenger evacuation) and it is necessary 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
for a fully automated line to have processes for both passengers and trains to deal with these events. 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
Metros operating fully automatic systems include: 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
 Vancouver Skytrain 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
 VAL systems (France and elsewhere);

 Lyon Metro Line D
