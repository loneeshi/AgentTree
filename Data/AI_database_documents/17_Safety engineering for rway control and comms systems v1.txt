Part 1: Safety Principles

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
This part should be treated as an addendum to the item in the Module A reading 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
list entitled "Back to Basics - Principles of Railway Safety Engineering, IRSE News, 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
Issue 267, June 2020“ which explains the identification and analysis of hazards and 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
risks. 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
Hazard, Risk and Safety Requirements

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
It is essential to derive a complete and correct

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
specification of safety requirements as part of system 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
development.

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
Systematic identification of hazards generally involves two phases:

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
• an empirical phase (exploiting past experience, e.g. checklists)

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
• a deductive phase (proactive forecasting, e.g. brain-storming, 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
structured what-if studies, HAZOP , FMEA).

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
Hazard Control consists of a number of activities which can be 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
summarized as follows:

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
• define the safety assumptions and system functions related to 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
the defined hazards

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
• define the system architecture and allocate system functions 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
within the architecture (technical solution) to meet the safety 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
requirements including the defined THRs

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
• perform the hazard analysis (or causal analysis), to evaluate 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
the possible causes of hazards

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
• determine the safety integrity requirements for the functions 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
of the system

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
• complete the safety requirements specification

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
• identify potential new hazards arising out of the system design

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
Process Overview

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
Risk Acceptance

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
Risk acceptance criteria depend on national or international legislative requirements.

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
The Common Safety Method (CSM) promoted by the European Rail Agency (ERA) recognises three risk 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
acceptance principles:

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
use of a code of practice;

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
use of a similar system as a reference;

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
explicit risk estimation (here the ERA says “The acceptability of the estimated risks shall be evaluated 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
using risk acceptance criteria either derived from or based on legal requirements stated in Community 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
legislation or in notified national rules”).

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
In the UK the legal requirement (Health & Safety at Work Act) is that risk should be made as low as reasonably 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
practicable (the ALARP principle – see next page).

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
In practice the CSM and ALARP principles are convergent, as use of a relevant industry code of practice or use 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
of a system similar to one already in use in comparable applications may be accepted as meeting the  ALARP 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
principle by following industry best practice.

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
ALARP

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
The ALARP principle:

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
Risk should be made As Low As Reasonably Practicable

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
A safety measure is not reasonably practicableif its cost is 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
grossly disproportionate to the safety benefit which it would 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
provide

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
Ways of demonstrating ALARP:

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
Cost/benefit analysis – show that the cost of preventing a 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
fatality is greater than the nominal value of life. UK has 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
financial values for preventing fatalities based on surveys of 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
people’s willingness to pay for safety.

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
Best practice – show that best practice in the industry has been 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
applied. It is not considered reasonably practicable to do 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
more than the best that others in the same industry achieve. 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
Compliance with ENs may be enough to demonstrate ALARP . 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
Engineering Safety Management

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
Safety Management can be defined as the organisational measures applied to ensure that an acceptable level 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
of safety is maintained throughout the life of a system. It has much in common with Quality Management: 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
both are concerned with the avoidance of loss.

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
What distinguishes Safety Management from Quality Management, or from the principles of good 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
management in general, is that Safety Management must concern itself with events which are sufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
improbable to be ignored by other aspects of management. For this reason hazard identification and risk 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
assessment are prominent components of Safety Management.

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
The respective contributions of Quality Management and Safety Management to the safety of a system can be 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
simply stated as follows: Quality Management ensures that the system does what was intended, while Safety 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
Management ensures that what was intended was safe.

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
Safety Management as a Process

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
The safety management process, especially in high-

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
hazard industry sectors, such as nuclear power, 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
aviation or petro-chemicals, is often depicted as 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
‘Plan-Do-Check-Act’ and can be likened to a closed-

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
loop feedback control system, as illustrated in the 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
figure on the right, which is based on the model used 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
by the Health and Safety Executive in their guidance.

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
Safety Management and Safety Integrity

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
The standards for safety-related electronic systems and software place particular emphasis on two aspects of 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
engineering safety management: INDEPENDENCE and DOCUMENTATION.

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
Independence of Roles

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
Many roles within an organisation, such as verifier, tester, validator or assessor, are concerned with confirming 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
the safety of what has been produced by other roles, such as designers and installers. Independence between 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
such roles may be required in order to reduce the probability of people in different roles suffering from the 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
same misconceptions or making the same mistakes. 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
It is also important that people in roles which involve making judgements about the acceptability of a product 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
or process from the point of view of safety should not be influenced by pressure from their peers or 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
supervisors, or by considerations of commercial gain. 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
Documentation

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
To engineer is essentially to generate or transform information, and engineering is a social activity involving 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
collaboration and exchanges between individuals and organisations.  Engineers work primarily with their 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
brains, and documentation is the medium through which the product of this work is recorded and shared with 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
others.

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
Ensuring the safety of complex systems is heavily dependent on large amounts of information being shared 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
among all the parties concerned, including designers, operators, safety assessors, regulators and safety 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
authorities.  Documents form the principal medium of exchange of information, and there are established 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
standards and guidelines for safety in systems engineering which set out requirements for what should be 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
documented and by whom the documents should be reviewed and assessed

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
Safety Case: Origins and Definitions

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
safety case

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
the documented demonstration that the 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
product complies with the specified safety 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
requirements

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
“A documented body of evidence that provides 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
a convincing and valid argument that a system 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
is adequately safe for a given application in a 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
given environment”

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
In the term “Safety Case” the word “case” is used with 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
the same meaning as in a law court – the evidence 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
offered in court to support a claim.

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
Safety cases were first used in the nuclear 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
and off-shore oil industries to gain 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
approval from their safety regulators

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
Why Safety Cases?

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
• In a Safety Case regime the Developer has to demonstrate that the 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
system is safe.

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
• This is potentially more effective than relying on the Assessor or 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
Approver investigating the system to find out if it is safe.

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
• With complex systems only the Developer has sufficient knowledge of 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
the system to produce the evidence of safety   

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
Structure and Content of a Safety Case

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
Types of Safety Case

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
The three types of safety case would apply to a

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
programmable interlocking system as shown 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
here. The signalling logic embodies the 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
signalling principles of the railway network, 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
while the geographical data configures each 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
interlocking to its respective track and signal 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
layout. 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
Part 2: Achieving Safety Integrity

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
What is Safety Integrity?

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
Safety Integrity is defined as the likelihood of a system satisfactorily 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
performing the required safety functions under all the stated 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
conditions within a stated period of time.

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
The expression “required safety functions “ includes the function of 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
reverting to a safe state in the event of a failure.

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
To achieve acceptable safety integrity we need to know why failures 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
occur and how components and systems behave in the event of failure.

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
Failures relevant to safety are commonly classified as being  either 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
random or systematic.

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
Random and Systematic 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
Failures

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
• From the point of view of the user, all failures are 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
random. If it was known when they would occur they 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
could be prevented or avoided.

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
• The failure of physical components is determined by the 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
laws of physics. They appear to happen at random 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
because we do not know enough about the precise 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
physical condition of the component.

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
• The significant demarcation is between failures whose 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
distribution is known and those whose distribution is 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
unknown.

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
• Failures for which there is reliable statistical data, i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
failures of well-established components, are treated as 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
Random Failures

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
• Failures for which reliable statistics do not exist, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
design errors (especially software) or failures of new 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
types of component, are treated as Systematic Failures.

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
Failure Categories

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
Designing to Take Account of Failure

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
In general, failures classified as “random” are those whose rate of occurrence cannot be made low enough to 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
provide to provide sufficient assurance of safety. For such failures safety is assured by means of the fail-safe 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
principle, which can be defined as “a design property of signalling equipment, and of the system within which 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
it is used, that under failure conditions will provide safety for traffic”.

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
In practice this is achieved by constructing signalling systems from subsystems or components having well-

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
defined predictable failure modes and ensuring that failure states correspond to restrictive traffic conditions.

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
Fail-safety, can be achieved in three different ways:

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
Inherent fail-safety, where the system or subsystem is designed so that any credible failure mode of any 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
of its component parts will result in a restrictive state.

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
Composite fail-safety. With this technique, each safety-related function is performed by at least two 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
items. Each of these items shall be independent from all others, to avoid common-cause failures. Non-

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
restrictive activities can progress only if the necessary numbers of items agree.

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
Reactive fail-safety. This technique allows a safety-related function to be performed by a single item, 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
provided its safe operation is ensured by rapid detection and negation of any hazardous fault by 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
another item.

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
Inherent Fail-Safety: The Semaphore signal

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
Perhaps the simplest example of a fail-safe component 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
is the semaphore signal with its counterbalance weight 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
to restore the signal to the “on” position should the 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
operating wire break.

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
Note that fail-safe behaviour also depends on the drive 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
rod being sufficiently strong not to beak or deform 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
under any force which may be applied to it.

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
OFF ON

--- Document Chunk 189 ---

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
Inherent Fail-Safety: The Signalling Relay

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
The fail-safe characteristics of the signalling relay are at 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
the heart of almost all classical electrical signalling 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
safety. In British signal engineering practice the principal 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
relay safety characteristics are an armature and contact 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
operating mechanism with sufficient restoring forces 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
from gravity and spring pressure to ensure that it will 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
release when the coil is de-energised, and non-weldable 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
contacts formed from mating and silver-impregnated 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
carbon pairs. 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
Signalling circuitry using such relays is designed so that 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
relays are required to be energised to enable a 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
“proceed” signal aspect to be given. Any failure, such as 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
a broken wire or high-resistance contact, will cause one 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
or more relays in the circuit concerned to de-energise, 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
in which case a restrictive signal aspect will be 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
displayed.

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
Safety features of Signalling relay

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
Non-weldable contacts

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
Restoring spring

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
Non-magnetic stud to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
armature being held by 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
residual magnetism when relay 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
de-energised

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
Composite and Reactive Fail-Safety

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
Inherent fail-safety is difficult to achieve in electronic systems because they generally comprise a large number 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
of electronic components with a wide variety of possible failure modes, so that it is not feasible to design so 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
that no credible failure mode of any component will result in an unsafe state.

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
Inherent fail-safety has been achieved for relatively simple electronic devices, such as the transmitter and 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
receiver units of audio frequency track circuits, but for more complex applications based on microprocessors 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
and other large-scale integrated electronic components, for example signal interlockings, composite or reactive 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
fail-safety, or often a blend of the two, is almost always the preferred solution.

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
Both techniques depend on there being a very low probability of simultaneous failures in independent parts of 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
the overall system. This calls for the system design to ensure that the time to detect and react to individual 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
failures is sufficiently short. It is also necessary to ensure that inherent fail-safety will be achieved with regard 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
to common-cause failures which might result in multiple simultaneous failures.

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
Composite Fail-Safety

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
Composite fail-safety not only requires two 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
independent functional channels to agree in 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
order to produce and output but also 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
requires that neither channel will have 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
detected a fault, typically by means of 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
internal self-testing routines.

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
The ability to detect a first fault and isolate 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
the faulty channel makes a significant 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
contribution to safety. If the first fault were 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
to remain undetected indefinitely, the 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
probability of a similar fault occurring in the 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
second channel during the life of the 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
equipment would be far from negligible. 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
Reactive Fail-Safety

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
In the event of a failure of Function A an 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
unsafe output can be present until negated 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
by the fault detection. Hence the value of T 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
for reactive fail-safety is much shorter than 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
the value for composite fail-safety.

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
Reactive fail-safety is to be found in relay 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
interlocking, where failure of signal lamps, 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
which are not inherently fail-safe, is 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
protected by lamp-proving circuits which 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
restrict the aspects of relevant signals when 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
a lamp failure is detected.

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
Common-Cause Failures

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
The Venn diagram and simple fault tree show how a common-cause failure (CCF) can 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
undermine the protection given by composite fail-safety. A common-cause failure between 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
function and fault detection would have a similar effect on reactive fail-safety.

Systematic Failures

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
Systematic failures result from errors which can occur at any 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
point in the lifecycle of a system or an item of equipment.

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
Examples of such errors are shown on the right. It is not 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
possible to use the fail-safe principle to protect against the 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
effects of systematic failures because there is no way of 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
ensuring that the only errors which can occur will be those 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
which result in a restrictive state.

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
Protection against systematic failure depends on preventing 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
or detecting and removing errors at each stage of the 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
lifecycle. The development of safety-related software is a 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
prime example of this approach.

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
The Advent of Software

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
The development of processor based systems in the 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
1980s brought the problem of software, which cannot 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
be fully tested.

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
The focus of safety assurance then shifted from product 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
to process.

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
The SIL Concept

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
• The concept of SIL (Safety Integrity Level) was introduced early in the development of standards 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
for safety related software because there was no way of measuring the probability of unsafe 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
failure of software.

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
• There is still no way of measuring this probability.

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
• Although it is not possible to determine a numerical value for the probability of failure, it is 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
reasonable to believe that if more effective design and Verification & Validation methods are 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
used, the probability will be lower.

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
• If the best possible methods are used, the software will have the highest possible safety integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
It was decided to have four categories of method, so that SIL 4 is the highest possible. 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
• The SIL concept has been extended from software to cover all types of systematic failure, such as 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
errors in requirements, design errors and manufacturing errors.

• The following definitions are shared by standards BS EN 50126, 50128 and 50129

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
Principles of Development for SIL 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
The principles applied in developing high integrity systems and software include, but 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
are not restricted to:

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
top-down design methods

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
modularity

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
verified components and component libraries (mainly for software)

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
verification of each phase of the development lifecycle,

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
clear documentation and traceability

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
auditable documents

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
validation

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
assessment

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
configuration management and change control

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
appropriate consideration of organisation and personnel competency issues

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
The standards EN 50129 (electronic systems) 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
and EN 50128 (software) include tables of 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
techniques and measures for implementing

Signalling and Data 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
Transmission

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
The diagram shows a state-of-the-art signalling 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
system where there are no lineside signals and vital 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
data giving authority for train movements is 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
transmitted to the train by radio. A fixed data link, 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
which may use optical fibres or copper conductors 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
for its transmission medium, transmits command 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
and status data between lineside equipment and the 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
control centre, and a speech link is also provided by 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
radio between the signaller and the train driver. This 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
system architecture is typical of that adopted for the 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
European Train Control System (ETCS)

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
Conceptual Model of Data Transmission System

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
Failures, errors and noise may affect any component in the model

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
Based on the OSI model of open transmission systems

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
Information may be transmitted through a 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
hierarchy of electronic systems which may 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
store, forward or otherwise manipulate the 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
information. Hardware or software faults in 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
any of these systems might corrupt the 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
information in unpredictable ways. The vital 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
information receiver and the safe process 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
must be capable of distinguishing between 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
valid and corrupt information. Ways of 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
making this distinction include:

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
• All physical signals above a certain 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
amplitude or within a certain frequency 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
band

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
• Digital data which satisfies particular 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
coding rules

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
• Messages which satisfy certain protocols, 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
e.g. have correct addresses or valid time 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
stamps

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
 Repeat messages

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
 Block coding

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
 Convolution or cyclic block coding

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
Protection in the procedural dimension

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
 Closed-loop protocols: receiver repeats message back to sender and awaits confirmation from sender before acting 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
on message

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
 Time stamping: message contains time of origin – receiver will reject information which is too old

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
 Sender’s address included in message – receiver will reject information from wrong sender, e.g. in the event of 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
message routing errors or cross-talk

Fail-Safe

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
The fail-safe principle is applied in the 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
transmission of safety information by 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
designing the receiving safe process to 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
adopt a restrictive state in the event of 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
errors being detected or loss of 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
transmission
