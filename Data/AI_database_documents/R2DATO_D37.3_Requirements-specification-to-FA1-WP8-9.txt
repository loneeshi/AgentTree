EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
Passenger traffic has significantly increased over the last few decades, straining existing 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
technologies and making further capacity increases through traditional methods unfeasible. Current 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
signalling systems have reached their limits. However, new altern atives that align with European 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
objectives ‒ such as creating a high-capacity, integrated railway network by removing interoperability 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
barriers, providing full integration solutions, and speeding up innovation  ‒ offer a way forward. 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), is one of the 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
implementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context of FP2 R2DATO, WP37 aims at 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the implementation of HTD. In this 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
deliverable, we set the requirements specification for the simulations that will be performed by FP1 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
WP8/9. To this end, we provide a methodology for defining the requirements specification to FP1 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
WP8/9. In particular, we define performance indicators related to capacity and robustness, where 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
capacity is assessed in simulations without external delays and robustness in simulations with 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
external delays (compared to the undelayed simulations). 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
This deliverable addresses the basis of the urgent need for railway signalling innovative solutions to 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
enhance railway capacity and efficiency. Many passengers are affected by these constraints, and 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
the consequences of not addressing these issues could severely impact the reliability and 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
sustainability of Europe's transportation network. This report seeks case studies in various European 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
countries to bridge existing gaps and foster consensus on the future direction of railway signalling 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
technology deployment, particularly focusing on ETCS HTD, which offers a balanced solution that 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
combines the benefits of modern train control technologies with the practicality and cost -

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
effectiveness of using existing infrastructure. This makes it an attractive option for rail operators 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
looking to enhance their systems without incurring the high costs and complexities associated with 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
full-scale replacements or upgrades. 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
Existing literature and prior research highlighted the potential benefits and initial successes of 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
HL3/HTD. However, significant gaps remains, particularly in real-world applicability and performance 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
under varied conditions. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
ERTMS/ETCS, followed by the investigation of various case studies and variables pertaining to the 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
HTD design. These variables are the size of the Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks, the size of 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
the Virtual Sub  Sections (VSS) and the s hare or types of trains equipped with Train Integrity 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
Monitoring (TIM). The scope encompasses various scenarios across fifteen rail lines and networks 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
in Europe, namely Spain, France, Sweden and the Netherlands. The case studies vary in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
infrastructure, traffic, general assumptions and scenarios. In particular, the level of complexity can 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
be different depending on the investigated set of performance indicators and scenarios, as well as 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
on the market segment. The investigated market segments include high-speed, mainline, regional, 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
(sub)urban and freight railways. By collaborating with key stakeholders and industry experts, these 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
specifications will be simulated on CAF tool (for the Spanish cases) and RailSys tool (for the Dutch, 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
Swedish and French cases)  to model and analyse different performance indicators under various 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
scenarios, including traffic and infrastructure conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
The added value of this deliverable is to check based on these requirements specification in which 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
design configurations, scenarios, market segments and cases HTD can be mostly beneficial. This 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
would allow to find the scenarios that would significantly reduce headways, allowing for more trains 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
to operate safely on the same tracks, thus addressing congestion issues effectively. The findings 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
from these test specifications will underscore the EU's added value in standardising and supporting 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
advanced rail technologies, promoting a more integrated and efficient European rail network.

While this deliverable  marks a significant basis and milestone for futher developments towards 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
deploying HL3/HTD, further research and innovation are necessary to fully realise the potential of 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
implementing this railway signalling technology . This deliverable  is the foundation for additional 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
studies focusing on long -term impacts, cost -benefit or multi -criteria analyses, standardisation, 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
roadmapping and deployment strategies. Future works within FP2 WP37 will include the 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
development of the methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks and determining ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
HL3 capacity impact analysis based on the FP1 WP8/9  simulations. In addition, next steps will 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
involve evaluating the market acceptance, with a focus on harmonising standards and regulations to 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
facilitate widespread adoption. Continuous advancements in technology and simulation models  for 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
various market segments and cases in Europe will be cruciall in refining the system and ensuring its 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
readiness for broader implementation.

2 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
Throughout Europe, passenger traffic has significantly increased over the last few decades, which 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
has led to a limitation of the existing technologies to meet future projected demand. Existing 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
signalling systems have been exploited to such an extent that c apacity increase by means of 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
conventional methods is no longer possible. However, new alternatives that fit the overall European 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
objectives (e.g., to deliver a high -capacity integrated European railway network by eliminating 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
barriers to interoperability, p roviding solutions for full integration, and achieving faster uptake and 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
deployment of innovation) represent a step ahead to tackle the abovementioned limitation: 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
Digitalisation and automation solutions for rail operation (e.g., Automatic Train Operation ( ATO) up 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
to Grade of Automation (GoA)4, ETCS Hybrid Train Detection and Moving Block and Advanced Safe 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
Train Positioning (ASTP) among others). 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
Deliverable D37.3 belongs to FP2 WP37 ‘ETCS HL3 Deployment Strategies’ that aims at developing 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of ETCS Hybrid Level 3, currently 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), which consequently reap the benefits as quickly as possible 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
and avoids costly investments in new infrastructure as much as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
2.1 RELATIONS WITH OTHER FLAGSHIPS, WORK PACKAGES AND DELIVERABLES IN 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
EUROPE'S RAIL 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
D37.3 relates to FP2 WP15 ‘Hybrid Level 3 Specification’ whose main objective is to align and 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
integrate the HTD approach into the future Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
System Pillar and to apply the defined principles to different kinds of railways. D37.3 also relates to 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
publicly available documents on ETCS HL3 specifications published by the ERTMS Users Group 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
(EUG).  

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
This deliverable is a main input to FP1 WP8 ‘Development - Simulation and operational feedback for 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
improved planning’ and F P1 WP9 ‘Demonstration - Simulation and operational feedback for 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
improved planning’. FP1 WP8/9 will perform the capacity simulations that align with the requirements 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
specification defined in this deliverable.  D37.3 also has dependencies with D37.1 ‘Standardisation 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
and deployment’ since the requirements specification are crucial when defining standardisation and 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
deployment. In addition, it relates to D37.2 ‘Methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks’ 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
since based on the input that will be received from FP1 WP8/9, the method for optimising the design 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
of blocks will be defined. In a further step, the results from D37.2 and from the capacity studies in 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
FP1 WP8/9 will be used as input for D37.4 ‘Determining ETCS HL3 capacity impact analysis using 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
simulations’. 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
2.2 OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
The main objective of this deliverable is to describe the requirements specification for the capacity 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
simulation studies. In particular, this deliverable aims at providing the performance indicators and 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
scenarios to be included in FP1 WP8 and calculated in  FP1 WP9 in order to find the right method 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
for applying HTD in several environments and for various market segments. These work packages 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
will perform research on the railway capacity  and the number of trains that can be handled, given 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
several infrastructure designs, timetables and technologies installed on the infrastructure side and

train side of the railway system. The description of the scenarios therefore focuses on finding the 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
different methods for infrastructure design from a railway capacity perspective. This deliverable sets 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
the basis for these work packages, that will also perform part of the research on the robustness of 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
the railway system for disturbances. This will be done with only deterministic delays. Stochastic 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
delays are excluded here, because of the lack of good input data (there are no comparable HTD 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
systems in operation). In addition, the reproduction of a scenario in a stochastic environment  and 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
the comparison of the results is more difficult  (due to the different propagation of knock -on delays 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
based on input delays). 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
This deliverable focuses on the simulation specifications that will be sent to EU Rail FP1 WP8/9 for 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
calculation and simulation. The analysis of the results of WP8/9 will be performed in Deliverables 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
D37.2 and D37.4 and will there lead to conclusions on bl ock layouts and optimal deployment 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
strategies.

3 ERTMS/ETCS OVERVIEW 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
The European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS), as introduced in the newly published 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
Technical Specification for Interoperability (CCS TSI 2023/1695), is being implemented all around 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
Europe to ensure interoperability. ERTMS includes the European Train Control System (ETCS) for 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
automatic train protection, the first baseline of ATO up to GoA2, the Global System for Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
Communications for Railways (GSM -R) and FRCMS . Improving the safety of national and 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
international train traffic, bringing benefit in terms of Total Cost of Owne rship (TCO) of the entire 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
Control Command and Signalling system (CCS), by reducing trackside assets, and increasing 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
capacity are among the most relevant advantages of ERTMS.  

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
Depending on the application level, ETCS trackside and on-board subsystems are characterized by 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
specific equipment on both the track and the train, their interaction, and their functions. The ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
levels establish different uses of ERTMS as a train control system [1]: 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
• ETCS Level 1: track-to-train spot communications, where a significant and costly amount of 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
trackside elements are required to control the movement of the train. Train detection and 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
train separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying  signalling 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
system.  

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
• ETCS Level 2: continuous communications between the train and the track, which enable a 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
reduction in OPEX and CAPEX and increase line capacity. Train detection and train 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
separation can be performed by the Radio Block Centre (in cooperation with the train which 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
sends position reports and train integrity information) and/or by other trackside equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
ETCS Level 2 is therefore a crucial player in the search for delivering better capacity, reducing costs, 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
improving flexibility, and increasing reliability of the railway network since dependency on trackside 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
equipment is minimized.   

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD) based on the ERTMS 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
Users Group [2], is one of the ETCS L2 implementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
of R2DATO, WP37 aims at developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
implementation of HTD.  

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
HTD is a concept that uses pre-configured fixed virtual blocks for the separation of trains. The virtual 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
blocks can be used by trains that are able to send integrity confirmation in the position report, while 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
trackside train detection is still used for the separation of trains which are not able to send integrity 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
confirmation. The trackside train detection is also used for the handling of degraded situations. The 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
main advantage of HTD is the reduction of trackside implementation cost (extending current 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks), an improved capacity performance (by introducing shorter 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
blocks), or a combination of both. 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
3.1 ETCS HYBRID LEVEL 3/HYBRID TRAIN DETECTION OBJECTIVE 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
The ERTMS Users Group [2] discuss how ETCS HL3/HTD aims at increasing line capacity and 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
optimizing the use of existing infrastructure. HTD improves train detection and safety by combining 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
track-side and on-board systems. In addition, HTD facilitates a smooth transition from conventional 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
systems and ensures compatibility. Therefore, the main goal of HTD  is to improve railway system 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
capacity, safety, and efficiency while reducing costs and enhancing operational flexibility.

3.2 ETCS HYBRID LEVEL 3 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND FUNCTIONALITY 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
The reference architecture for HTD is the current ERTMS architecture defined in the TSI (omitting 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
some ETCS level 1 features), as shown in Figure 1 [3]. 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
Figure 1: Current ERTMS architecture defined in the TSI [3] 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
Regarding this architecture and the associated functionality of HTD, the following considerations are 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
made: 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
In general, the trains without ETCS but with the National System can be managed in HTD as “ghost 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
trains” (detected by the TTD but not reporting its location to the trackside). These features are subject 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
to specific application analyses, as the behaviour of the National System is not harmonised. 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
The HTD-ready trains are generally expected to be equipped at least with a system providing the 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
train integrity information to the EVC (OTI-I) and optionally a system providing the safe train length 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
(OTI-L). Integrated devices providing more than one information are possible. Trains equipped with 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
ETCS but without OTI -I can be allowed in HTD, but treated as non -integer trains, still having the

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
HTD performance however giving to the following train a performance analogue to ERTMS Level 2 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
with only TTD.   

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
The functionality of the system relies in the Hybrid Train Detection Concept. This concept is based 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
on the following essential components/functionalities: 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
• Positive Train Detection (PTD): PTD relies on information received from the train itself. It 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
uses position reports sent by the train, including data such as position, integrity status, and 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
safe train length. When a train reports “integrity confirmed,” it becomes an “integer train”. The 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
trackside can use this information to determine the train’s location and manage train 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
movements. PTD allows for reduced trackside infrastructure since it does  not rely solely on 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
physical sensors (such as track circuits or axle counters). 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
• Trackside Train Detection (TTD): TTD is the conventional method of train detection using 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
physical sensors installed along the track (e.g., track circuits or axle counters). In the HTD 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
system, the TTD sections are subdivided into smaller units called Virtua l Sub -Sections 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
(VSSs). Each VSS corresponds to a portion of the TTD section and has its own occupation 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
status (free, occupied, ambiguous or unknown). TTD information can confirm whether a train 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
is or not physically present on a VSS. 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
• Virtual Sub-Sections (VSS): VSSs are the building blocks of the HTD system. They allow for 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
finer granularity in train separation. Each VSS can be in one of four states (based on trackside 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
information): 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
o Free: No train is located on the VSS. 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
o Occupied: An integer train is present on the VSS, and no other vehicle is behind it. 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
o Ambiguous: A train is present, but there might be another non -connected vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
behind it. 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
o Unknown: No train is confirmed on the VSS, but its status is uncertain. 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
VSS states are dynamically updated by means of a VSS state machine, which is operated 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
based mainly on position reports, TTD information, the status of the HTD timers and 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
Movement Authority (MA) information. 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
• Train Location: The concept of “train location” defines the trackside view of the portion of 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
track currently occupied by a connected train. The front end of the train location is determined 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
by the train’s max safe front end position and train detection inf ormation. According to the 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
EUG document on the HTD Principles (published on 16 July 2024), the front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
location is not depending on the integrity status. The train integrity is based on the rear end 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
of the train location which is "established" for a train treated as integer or "assumed" for a 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
train which is not treated as an integer  [2]. Therefore, the rear end of the train location is 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
either “established rear end” (for integer trains) or “assumed rear end” (for non-integer trains). 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
• HTD timers: For handling degraded situations, there are two types of timers defined within 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
the HTD concept: 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
o Waiting timers: they are aimed to avoid unnecessary changes in the state of a VSS 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
due to the asynchronicity of train position, train integrity and TTD information. They 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
are: 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
▪ Mute timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider after a 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
defined time that the communication with that train is lost; 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
▪ Wait integrity timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
after a defined time that the integrity of that train is lost when no integrity 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
information is available;

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
▪ Shadow train timer: used to prevent wrongful detection of shadow trains 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
(ghost trains chasing normal HTD operated trains). 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
o Propagation timers: they are implemented in the trackside to avoid unnecessary 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
propagation of  the state “unknown” to VSS sections for which there is no immediate 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
risk that a rail vehicle could be located on them. They are: 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
▪ disconnect propagation timer: used at the trackside for each track section to 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
consider after a defined time that an “unknown” track section should be 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
propagated after train disconnection; 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
▪ ghost train propagation timer: used to prevent the risk of undetected ghost 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
trains; 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
▪ integrity loss propagation timer: used at the trackside for each track section to 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
consider after a defined time that an “unknown” track section should be 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
propagated after integrity loss. 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
The introduction of VSS in general does not change the principles of route setting and handling of 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
MAs since VSSs are treated in the same way as sections with TTD. HTD is an enhanced train 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
detection concept too allow an optiomal use of PTD and TTD train detection systems. HTD can be  

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
used in train centric or geographical safety sytems and with conventional signalling systems. The 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
HTD can be used with the existing legacy rules and interfaces. To give an example, it is possible 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
that the RBC today takes as a necessary but not sufficient condition to send an MA in Full

4 METHODOLOGY 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
This chapter presents the methodology used for defining the requirements specification to FP1 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
WP8/9. In particular, in section 4.1 we present the performance indicators for the capacity simulation 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
studies. In 4.2 we define the set -up of scenarios and varia bles, followed by the description of the 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
simulation environments CAF tool and RailSys in 4.3.  

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
4.1 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
There are several performance indicators to be assessed after executing the simulations. Together, 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
these performance indicators will provide a complete overview of the effects of ERTMS HL3/HTD 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
regarding capacity. These relate to the general terms of capacity and robustness. The capacity will 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
be assessed in simulations without external delays and the robustness in simulations with external 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
delays (compared to the undelayed simulation). Both require different performance indicators that 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
are elaborated in Table 1 and Table 2. 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios without external delays are explained in 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
Table 1.

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
The scenarios of the Swedish southern mainline and the Dutch SAAL corridor will be assessed 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
further for the aspect of robustness by letting a train block the other traffic for a set number of 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
minutes. This gives the insight in how quickly the block layout given a particular traffic pattern helps 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
to solve the congestion. The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios with external 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
delays are explained in Table 2.

4.2 SET-UP OF SCENARIOS AND VARIABLES  

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
This section describes how the scenarios have been set -up to achieve the aim of this deliverable. 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
Note that there are several benefits of HTD that will not be the focus of this deliverable. Only research 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
related to capacity and robustness will be the focus  of these case studies as stated in Section 4.1. 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
For capacity, the headway between two following trains  will be computed or the relative capacity 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
utilisation of a full timetable will be calculated. For robustness calculations , some scenarios will be 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
set up in which a train blocks the corridor for a set time period, where the aim is to study the recovery 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
time, number of affected trains and total delay.  

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
Simulation with stochastic disruptions will not be included in this stage, for several reasons. The 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
input data of real disruptions is not available for future or hypothetical situations analysis, scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
are harder to reproduce or compare and finally thi s method requires many runs which makes 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
simulation and analysis more time consuming. Overcoming these issues does not outweigh the 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
benefits, so stochastic analysis is not foreseen in this deliverable. Therefore, all simulations will be 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
deterministic with no delays or fixed delays in the simulation.  

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
In every scenario, we define a reference situation, using the current or future base information about 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
the track and calculating the headway or relative capacity utilisation. After that, and through 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
variations of the physical blocks and incorporating virtual blocks, accordi ng to what is proposed in 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
each scenario, improvement in capacity will be sought in these cases where the capacity is the main 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
objective. When the objective is cost reduction and only keeping equal capacity, we look for keeping 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
the current headway but changing the physical blocks into VSSs. 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
These results are used not only in this work package in tasks T37.3 and T37.5, but also in FP2 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
WP32. 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
Each case study described in Chapter 5 includes four parts:  

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
• Infrastructure: a description of the part of the railway network used in the case studies, either 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
the current infrastructure for existing lines or the planned infrastructure for a greenfield situation. 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
• Traffic: a description of the train services on the delimited network and possible alterations that 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
could influence the scenario. The described traffic could be either current traffic (high flows

where HTD could help increase robustness), or future traffic flows demands that could only 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
possibly be achieved with HTD.  

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
• Assumptions: this section describes additional assumptions for the simulations, like timetable 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
principles. 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
• Scenarios: a description of the different infrastructure and traffic scenarios. They always relate 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
to reference scenario and then build up in order to make the results comparable with only one 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
variable changed at a time. The variables are described below. 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
For our simulation studies of HTD there are three variables of interest: the lengths of the TTD blocks, 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
the lengths of the VSSs and the availability of TIMs on trains. These variables are defined for each 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
scenario and depend on the state and aim of each network. 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
• Size of the TTD blocks [m] : A benefit with HTD is the possibility to extend the current TTDs 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
without affecting capacity negatively. This means that for some scenarios varying the size of 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
TTD is of interest. 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
• Size of the VSS [m]: For creating additional capacity with additional blocks it is not necessary 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
anymore to add axle counters or loops, but it can be done with adding VSSs. Therefore the 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
size of VSSs is crucial for the capacity computation. 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
• Share of trains equipped with TIM [% or based on train type]: The availability of TIM equipped 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
trains in the traffic pattern has impact on the capacity and robustness. This might be a 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
percentage of the trains or defined as one train category to have a TIM and another to not have 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
a TIM. 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
4.3 SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
Two simulation environments will be used in EU Rail FP1 WP9 for assessing the case studies of this 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
work package: the tool of CAF for exploratory research based on the headway of two trains for the 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
Spanish case studies and RailSys for the French, Swedish an d Dutch case studies that involve a 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
complete timetable and in some cases external delays. Both simulation environments are briefly 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
described in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
4.3.1 CAF tool 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
The simulations for the Spanish cases will be performed in the CAF tool. It is focussed on calculating 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
headways. Therefore the tool needs information about the rolling stock and about the technical and 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
the physical characteristics of the track. The tool is limited to work with two trains at the same time: 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
the predecessor and its follower. According to this information, it offers the headway between them 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
as a solution. 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
4.3.2 RailSys  

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
The simulation software RailSys is an integrated microscopic planning tool, developed by RMCon. 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
RailSys is widely used in the railway sector by infrastructure managers, railway undertakings 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
consulting firms and research institutes [4]. RailSys features native ERTMS/ETCS support and

detailed calculations of the ETCS braking curves. Infrastructure and rolling stock are modelled on a 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
microscopic level, which provides sufficiently detailed settings for the modelling of HTD and 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
analytical possibilities for the results. 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
Infrastructure models are needed for all scenario s which utilise RailSys. In case of current lines, 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
existing models will be used as a basis of the studies. For some scenarios, ERTMS/ETCS will need 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
to be implemented in the models. HTD needs to be designed and applied to a ll existing models for 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
the relevant scenarios. It is important that relevant settings are correctly used to achieve a credible 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
simulation result. Coordination between partners is necessary for this purpose. 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
For the evaluation of capacity utilisation, the UIC-406 compression method in RailSys will be used. 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
In RailSys, the interpretation of UIC -406 is based on the compression of sequential timetable train 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
paths within divided sections [4]. According to the method, RailSys identifies conflicts in the timetable 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
and moves affected trains exactly unhindered behind the conflicting train. The outcome from the 

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
RailSys computation is the capacity utilisation which will be generated from specific case studies as 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
described in Chapter 5.

5 CASE STUDIES AND SCENARIOS 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
To fulfill the aims of developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
ETCS HTD, the several research scenarios have been defined according to the set-up described in 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
the previous chapter. These scenarios are used for evaluating the requirements specification of HTD. 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
The lines have been chosen where the main advantages of HTD can be f ound, both in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
reduction of trackside implementation costs and improvement of capacity performance.  

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
The general outline is that the Spanish cases and a Swedish case will be described and analysed 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
based on headways. Thereafter , the French and Swedish case s will be assessed on capacity by 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
relative capacity utilisation. Finally another Swedish case and the Dutch case are desribed and 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
analysed for relative capacity utilisation and robustness aspects. 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
Since there are many case studies described in this chapter, Table 3 provides an overview of the 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
locations, market segments, network length, reference signalling system and performance 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
indicators. The explanation follows in the paragraphs of every separate case study.

5.1 SPAIN: ATOCHA COMMUTER TUNNELS  

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
5.1.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
This is a double -track ETCS Level 1 section for commuter trains between Chamartín and Atocha 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
stations, with a length of 7.4 km, this section is selected for study as it is a central node where many 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
lines come together, more specifically, almost all of Madrid's commuter lines. 

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
There are two options for this route: through Recoletos tunnel stopping at Recoletos station 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
(Chamartín-Nuevos Ministerios -Recoletos-Atocha) or through Sol tunnel stopping at Sol station 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
(Chamartín-Nuevos Ministerios-Sol-Atocha). Figure 2 displays the schematic of the lines involved.

5.1.2 Traffic 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
The traffic of the line consists of commuter trains every 7 minutes on both Recoletos and Sol routes, 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
regional trains every 45 minutes through Recoletos and every 3 hours through Sol. The timetable for 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
the Atocha commuter lines can be found in [6]. The maximum speed of the trains is 90 km/h. 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
5.1.3 General assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
All the trains are equipped with TIMs in the reference scenario. 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
TIMs conditions are changed for the rest of the simulations as explained in the following section. 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
5.1.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
For the scenarios to be simulated in this section, two objectives are pursued. On the one hand, the 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
aim is to achieve an increase in capacity; on the other hand, the aim is to reduce costs. Considering 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
the following described conditions, the goal is to find a balance between both, cost and capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
In order to achieve these objectives, different scenarios are proposed to check, by simulation, if, 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
firstly, the defined goals are achieved and, secondly, if the results are valid. 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
First, the reference scenario is defined, which is the current track and traffic status, and will be used 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
to compare the rest of the scenarios to be simulated. In this way, we will obtain an answer on whether 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
we have improved the defined goals regarding the current state. 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
These scenarios are determined by modifying different elements: making changes in the 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
infrastructure (TTD), modifying the integrity of the rolling stock and incorporating VSSs. 

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
Since the objectives to be achieved for this line are both capacity improvement and cost reduction, 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
the chosen scenarios are the following: 

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
In relation to traffic and rolling stock, two alternative conditions are defined: the first is that it is 

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
assumed that commuter trains are equipped with TIMs, whereas regional trains are not equipped 

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
with it (Scenarios 1 and 2 in Table 4). The second condition is to consider that all the trains are 

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
equipped with TIMs (Scenarios 3 and 4 Table 4). This way, differences regarding capacity between 

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
those cases can be compared, where it could be visualized whether a decrease in capacity is 

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
obtained as a result when not having TIMs equipped. 

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
Regarding TTDs, in the first scenario, the current TTD layout remains with no change. As mentioned, 

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
the cost reduction goal is also pursued, therefore, a case where TTDs are reduced between stations 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
to the minimum is defined. By reducing the number of physical TTDs, a cost reduction could be 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
obtained as a result of not installing them when designing a track.

However, if we only reduce the TTDs, this could be reflected in a decrease in capacity, hence, VSSs 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
are incorporated. For the length of these, a methodology for optimal VSS lengths for each specific 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
line should be followed. 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
However, in the absence of such methodology, it is intended to make an engineering study of the 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
line, where the most critical sections of the track will be identified and analyzed. Firstly, a maximum 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
VSS length (taking into account the TTD maximum size) is implemented, then, a simulation is runned 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
and a new VSS size decreased by multiples of 25  is simulated. Several iterations are performed

5.2 SPAIN: MADRID C-5 CERCANÍAS  

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
5.2.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
This is a double -track commuter line between Mostoles-El Soto and Humanes with 21 stations in 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
between them, with a length of 45.1 km. The used signalling system is Class B. 

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
This line is selected for study as it is the only one in Spain working with automatic driving, where it 

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
is expected to eliminate this LZB and install ERTMS. 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
Figure 4 represents the  scheme of the line where all the  21 stations appear . A  fully technical

5.2.2 Traffic 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
Unlike the rest of the commuter network, the C -5 line has similar frequencies to the Madrid Metro 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
lines. 

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---
The traffic consists of commuter trains every 5 minutes during peak hours and every 10 minutes 

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
during off-peak hours. 

--- Document Chunk 1060 ---
This is the only case study where there is a differentiation between peak and off -peak hours 

--- Document Chunk 1061 ---
regarding train frequency. 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
The maximum speed of the trains is 155 km/h. 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1064 ---
5.2.3 General assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
Stations are closer to each other than the rest of the Madrid commuter lines and it has a particular 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
signalling and supervision system, the LZB, a train protection system with continuous transmission 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
of information and monitoring of the vehicle speed. 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---

5.2.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
The objectives of this scenario are also cost reduction and capacity increase, where different 

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
infrastructure, rolling stock and VSS conditions are defined. 

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
Regarding rolling stock, it is defined a case where all the trains are equipped with TIMs and another 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
case where trains are not equipped with TIMs. This way, we could compare the two situations in 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
terms of capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
Concerning trackside conditions and in order to get a cost reduction, a condition where TTDs are 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
reduced  between stations with no change in stations is defined while another condition is defined 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
where the current TTD layout is maintained. 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
In the case of VSSs, once the knowledge acquired in the Atocha commuter tunnels study for 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
determining the most critical sections can be applied while using the previously mentioned 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
methodology for determining the optimal VSS size for each case, several simulating iterations 

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
starting from the minimum possible VSS length will be carried out.  The proposed scenarios for the

This is a double-track high-speed line between Barcelona and Figueras with a length of 130 km. It 

--- Document Chunk 1198 ---

--- Document Chunk 1199 ---
following: Barcelonna-Sants, Sant Andreu Comtal, Mollet, Llinars, Riells, Vilobi d´Onyar, Girona, 

--- Document Chunk 1200 ---
Figueres. 

--- Document Chunk 1201 ---

km/h) every 2 hours and high-speed trains (250-350 km/h) every 3 hours. 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
5.4.3 General assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
Current trains are equipped with TIMs. For the simulations, passenger trains remain equipped with 

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---
it and freight trains will not. 

--- Document Chunk 1209 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
5.4.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---
The objective to reach by this simulating experiment is to get an increase in capacity. This is a 

--- Document Chunk 1212 ---
mainline with high-speed and freight traffic between Madrid and Torrejón de Velasco.   

--- Document Chunk 1213 ---
Concerning rolling stock, passenger trains will remain all equipped with TIMs as it is more critical 

--- Document Chunk 1214 ---
because of punctuality and other possible service problems. Freight trains will not be equipped with 

--- Document Chunk 1215 ---
TIMs because it  is deemed less critical than for passenger trains, primarily due to punctuality 

--- Document Chunk 1216 ---
concerns and their associated impacts.  

--- Document Chunk 1217 ---
The TTDs remain as they are now in the reference scenario . However, VSSs are incorporated in 

--- Document Chunk 1218 ---
order to get an increase in capacity. The VSS lengths will be the ones taken from the methodology 

--- Document Chunk 1219 ---
for reaching optimal sizes through iterations by simulating this specific scenario taking into account

following: El Prat de Llobregat-Paseo de Gracia (Paseo de Gracia tunnel), Hospitalet-Aragó (Plaza 

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
Cataluña tunnel) and Sagrera -Granollers (Montmeló tunnel) . The reference signalling system is

5.7.4  Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1378 ---
The main objective for this line is to improve capacity, hence, conditions for rolling stock, TTD and 

--- Document Chunk 1379 ---
VSS are determined. 

--- Document Chunk 1380 ---
For the rolling stock, a case where passenger trains are equipped with TIMs and freight trains are 

--- Document Chunk 1381 ---
not is defined and another case where both passengers and freight trains will be equipped with TIMs 

--- Document Chunk 1382 ---
is also defined. The TTDs remain as they are now in the reference  scenario, however, VSSs are 

--- Document Chunk 1383 ---
incorporated in order to get an increase in capacity. The VSS lengths will be the ones taken from the 

--- Document Chunk 1384 ---
methodolgy for reaching optimal sizes through iterations by simulating. The proposed scenarios for 

--- Document Chunk 1385 ---
the Cercanías Barcelona case study are shown in Table 10.

5.8 FRANCE: LILLE 

--- Document Chunk 1426 ---
5.8.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
This case study consists of a  project for the development of the regional lines around Lille. The 

--- Document Chunk 1428 ---
project is planned to be completed in 2040, and includes both capacity improvements of existing 

--- Document Chunk 1429 ---
infrastructure and a new double -track line (Hénin-Beaumont – Lille) for high-speed regional trains. 

--- Document Chunk 1430 ---
The new line is planned to be equipped with ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1431 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1432 ---
5.8.2 Traffic 

--- Document Chunk 1433 ---
The traffic of the network includes regional and suburban trains. The aim of the project is to increase 

--- Document Chunk 1434 ---
traffic on all routes to/from Lille, doubling the frequencies to four train s per hour. The new Hénin -

--- Document Chunk 1435 ---
Beaumont – Lille line has a target of 12 trains per hour in each direction.  It is planned to have only 

--- Document Chunk 1436 ---
suburban and regional trains on the new line that will be studied. The time-distance diagram for the 

--- Document Chunk 1437 ---
Lille case study is shown in Figure 8.

5.8.3 General assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 1444 ---
All trains running on the “Réseau Express Hauts-de-France, REHF”, will be equipped with TIMs for 

--- Document Chunk 1445 ---
the ETCS HTD scenarios. 

--- Document Chunk 1446 ---
There is currently no scheme plan that shows the divi sion of the ETCS block sections for the line. 

--- Document Chunk 1447 ---
Therefore, asumptions will be made for the division of ETCS block sections (around 1.5 km for ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1448 ---
L2 and less for ETCS HTD (length to be determined).

5.8.4 Scenarios  

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
The aim in this case study is to determine the capacity effect of ETCS HTD compared to ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
level 2 on the new double track line (Lille Euraflandres – Henin Beaumont). Because all trains in 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
the network are regional and suburban, it can be assumed that all trains will either not have TIMs 

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
(the reference) or have TIMs. This gives the following proposed scenarios in Table 11.

5.9 FRANCE: BRETAGNE PAYS DE LOIRE (LNOBPL) 

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
5.9.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
The LNOBPL is a new proposed high-speed line in France. The aim of the project is to improve the 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
rail connection between Brittany and Pays de la Loire. Several infrastructure improvements are 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
proposed, including a new high-speed line, capacity treatment of critical sections of the existing 

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
infrastructure, and implementation of ERTMS/ETCS on the existing lines. Implementing HTD on new 

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
lines or on an existing line is seen as an option. 

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
As the new high -speed line will not have a high capacity requirement, the study will focus on the 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
existing line that are planned to be equiped with ETCS. These lines have high capacity requirement 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
as they support mixed trafic (regional, suburban, high -speed and freight trains) The exact relev ant 

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
lines of the network where the study will be carried out are still to be determined. 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---

5.9.2 Traffic 

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
The aim the project is to improve the frequency of the suburban, inter-regional , and high-speed links 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
to/from Paris by increasing rail capacity and improving journey times, while supporting the 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
development of rail freight. The traffic is mixed with high-speed train, regional trains, suburban trains 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
and freight trains running on the sames tracks. The planned timetable for the line Rennes – Brest is 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
shown in Figure 9.

--- Document Chunk 1512 ---
All suburban and regional trains running on the network will be equipped with TIMs for the ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1513 ---
HTD scenarios. 

--- Document Chunk 1514 ---
All freight trains running on the network will not be equipped with TIMs for the ETCS HTD scenarios. 

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
Two scenarios for the ETCS HTD will be studied for the high-speed trains : 

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
• 1st scenario: High-speed trains equipped with TIMs. 

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
• 2nd scenario: High-speed trains not equipped with TIMs. 

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
There is currently no scheme plan that shows the division of the ETCS block sections for the Britany 

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
and Pays de la Loire network. Ther efore, asumptions will be made for the divi sion of ETCS block 

--- Document Chunk 1520 ---
sections (around 1.5 km for ETCS L2 and less for ETCS HTD (length to be determined)). 

--- Document Chunk 1521 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
5.9.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
The interest of this case study is to determine the capacity effect of ETCS HTD compared to ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
level 2, as displayed in Table 12, where different scenarios will be compared with trains equiped or 

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---
not with TIMs.  

--- Document Chunk 1526 ---
For the reference scenario, no trains will be equipped with TIMs (only ETCS L2).  

--- Document Chunk 1527 ---
For ETCS HTD, we will model a scenario with only the regional/suburban trains equiped wih TIMs 

--- Document Chunk 1528 ---
and a scenario with either the regional/suburban trains and the high-speed trains equiped with TIMs.  

--- Document Chunk 1529 ---
For all scenarios, freight trains will not be equipped with TIMs.  The proposed scenarios for the 

--- Document Chunk 1530 ---
LNOBPL French case are displayed in Table 12.

5.10 SWEDEN: STOCKHOLM CITYBANAN  

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
5.10.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
A 6 km long commuter line through the city centre of Stockholm. The line is doubletrack with two 

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
stations on the line (Stockholm City and Stockholm Odenplan), both with platforms on the main track.  

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---
No shunting is allowed at Stockholm City or Stockholm Odenplan. The tunnel is deep which means 

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
that there are high gradients at the start and end of the line, which affects the braking curves 

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
depending on down - or uphill. Gradients could also limit the possibility of VSS deployments, as i t 

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---
should be possible to stop and accelerate at each VSS. The current line uses track circuit for TTD. 

--- Document Chunk 1557 ---
However, there are plans to change the TTDs to axle counters. The timeline is not confirmed. For 

--- Document Chunk 1558 ---
the simulation of the line, the length of model should be longer than the 6 km. This is because the 

--- Document Chunk 1559 ---
traffic on the connected lines will limit the possible capacity on Citybanan. The infrastructure layouts 

--- Document Chunk 1560 ---
of the Stockholm Citybanan case are shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11.

--- Document Chunk 1571 ---
Traffic on the Citybanan consists of only commuter trains. The capacity consumption is high, with 

--- Document Chunk 1572 ---
392 trains/day (data from Trafikverket 2023), see Figure 12. It is also likely that there will be a need 

--- Document Chunk 1573 ---
to increase the traffic in the future.

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
Dwell time at Stockholm City is limited to 2 min during peak traffic, and 1 min at Stockholm Odenplan. 

--- Document Chunk 1584 ---
Trains also need to time the stops with platform screen doors, which can lead to extended dwell 

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
times. In some cases, trains need to reverse to align wit h the screen doors. Adding strain to the 

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
timetable, increasing the need for increasing the capacity, which HTD can help to alleviate.

5.10.3 General assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
For the simulations, it is assumed that all other traffic (non -commuter trains) at lines connecting to 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
Citybanan are non-integer. 

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
Traffic is assumed to be the same as the current timetable. 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
5.10.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
As the line has high capacity utilisation today, the performance indicator headway and the UIC-406 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
compression method are relevant for this case. Capacity is a prioritising criterion on this line as it is 

--- Document Chunk 1598 ---
already at its limits. Robustness could be of inter est. However, as trains travel on a much larger 

--- Document Chunk 1599 ---
network than Citybanan, the simulated network would need to be extended. Therefore, a simulation 

--- Document Chunk 1600 ---
of the extended network would be too complex for analysing capacity. The benchmark, i.e. signalling

--- Document Chunk 1610 ---
system used as a starting point, should be ETCS L2, as the line is planned to be upgraded to 

--- Document Chunk 1611 ---
ERTMS.  

--- Document Chunk 1612 ---
The specific scenarios have been chosen depending on shares of trains integrated with train 

--- Document Chunk 1613 ---
integrity. Because all the trains occupying the line have the same train types, it can be assumed that 

--- Document Chunk 1614 ---
there will be a migration phase (where some of the train have  train integrity), followed by the entire 

--- Document Chunk 1615 ---
fleet being upgraded with train integrity. The specific value of VSS should be selected with the aim 

--- Document Chunk 1616 ---
of decreasing the headway. The Citybanan trains are already tightly packed, so the VSS should be 

--- Document Chunk 1617 ---
as short as possible. The document ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Train Detection: Principles [2] mentions 

--- Document Chunk 1618 ---
25 meters as an example of minimum length. However, if there are restrictions with the simulation 

--- Document Chunk 1619 ---
tool (e.g., run time of the simulation), a VSS length of up to 100 meters can be accepted. We 

--- Document Chunk 1620 ---
therefore propose the infrastructure and traffic scenarios as presented in Table 13.

new stations (Vagnhärad, Nyköping, Skavsta, Norrköping and Linköping) and is planned to allow 

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
train speeds of 250 km/h. The line is part of a future high -speed line in Sweden, connecting

5.12  SWEDEN: SOUTHERN MAINLINE (NORRKÖPING – MJÖLBY)  

--- Document Chunk 1699 ---
5.12.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1700 ---
The section Norrköping–Mjölby is part of the Southern Mainline between Stockholm and Malmö, one 

--- Document Chunk 1701 ---
of the most important railway connection in Sweden. The section between Norrköping –Mjölby is 

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
about 79 km long, double track and electrified. The Southern Mainline infrastructure is illustrated in 

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
Figure 14. The allowed speed on the section is between 110 –200 km/h. The section consists of 

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
seven stations, where two stations (Linghem and Kimstad) have platforms on the main track and no 

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
possibility for overtaking.

5.12.2 Traffic 

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
The traffic on the section Norrköping–Mjölby (Table 15) consists of freight, long-distance and 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
regional trains. There is a high degree of speed difference of the train types. Long-distance trains 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
have an allowed speed of 200 km/h, regional trains of 160 km/h, and freight trains of 100 km/h.

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
Traffic is assumed to be the same as the current timetable. 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
5.12.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
Performance indicators of specific interest for the Southern Mainline are headway, the UIC -406 

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
compression method and recovery time. The reason is that capacity and robustness are important 

--- Document Chunk 1744 ---
aspects of this line, as the capacity utilization is high, and the  line is prone to disturbances. The 

--- Document Chunk 1745 ---
signalling system ETCS L2 is used as benchmark, as there is an ongoing project to implement 

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
ERTMS on the line.  

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
The traffic scenarios have been chosen from the assumption that different train types will be 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
upgraded with train integrity in steps, from easy implementation to complex. For this reason, it is 

--- Document Chunk 1749 ---
assumed that railcars will have working train integrity in a f irst step, followed by locomotive-hauled 

--- Document Chunk 1750 ---
passenger, and lastly freight trains. The value for VSS lengths in this case study should be from the 

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
assumption of a simple deployment strategy. Meaning, that the VSS lengths have a standardized 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
length. This is mainly because of two reasons: firstly, it simplifies the simulations in this first step of 

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
studying the deployment strategies; secondly, studying the effect of a standardized length could be 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
of interest as it would save cost for the HTD deployment project. A standardized VSS length, in this 

--- Document Chunk 1755 ---
step, should be in the range of 200 – 500 meters. The reason for this is that similar values have been 

--- Document Chunk 1756 ---
used in earlier studies [12]. 

--- Document Chunk 1757 ---
The total number of scenarios to be simulated for the Swedish Southern mainline is 16  (four train 

--- Document Chunk 1758 ---
integrity scenarios per infrastructure scenario). The scenarios for the implementation of virtual blocks 

--- Document Chunk 1759 ---
and the extension of current blocks are reported in Table 16.

5.13 THE NETHERLANDS: SAAL-CORRIDOR (SCHIPHOL AIRPORT, AMSTERDAM, 

--- Document Chunk 1798 ---
ALMERE, LELYSTAD) 

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
The SAAL-corridor is one of the busiest railway lines in the Netherlands on which a capacity increase 

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
is planned by implementing ETCS L2. From Schiphol airport, the line runs to the intercity station of 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
Amsterdam Zuid, then via Weesp to Almere and ends in Lelystad. The line contains multiple 

--- Document Chunk 1802 ---
locations where traffic merges and diverges to other corridors.  

--- Document Chunk 1803 ---
In this section, we describe the infrastructure scenarios and traffic scenarios for the SAAL corridor. 

--- Document Chunk 1804 ---
Next, we elaborate on several assumptions that are relevant for the Netherlands. Finally, we describe 

--- Document Chunk 1805 ---
which simulations are to be executed. 

--- Document Chunk 1806 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1807 ---
5.13.1 Infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 1808 ---
The infrastructure consists of several parts of 4 -track. These sections lie between Hoofddorp, 

--- Document Chunk 1809 ---
Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid and around Weesp. Furthermore, the stations of Rai, Weesp, Almere 

--- Document Chunk 1810 ---
Centrum, Almere Oostvaarders and Lelystad Centrum provide more than 2 platform tracks. The rest 

--- Document Chunk 1811 ---
of the line is all double track. 

--- Document Chunk 1812 ---
The reference infrastructure scenario is the base infrastructure on which a Level 2 design from the 

--- Document Chunk 1813 ---
real project is assigned according to design version 2.0 of February 2024. We will vary two 

--- Document Chunk 1814 ---
infrastructure design parameters in order to find the ideal desi gn principle under various conditions 

--- Document Chunk 1815 ---
of usage.propose 7 different infrastructure scenarios, based on variations around two parameters to 

--- Document Chunk 1816 ---
find the proper design principles for various usage of the: 

--- Document Chunk 1817 ---
1. Number of axle counters 

--- Document Chunk 1818 ---
2. Distance of virtual blocks 

--- Document Chunk 1819 ---
3. Based on these two parameters we have created seven infrastructure design scenarios that 

--- Document Chunk 1820 ---
will be described below. 

--- Document Chunk 1821 ---
The number of TTD blocks can be varied in 3 gradations: 

--- Document Chunk 1822 ---
1. The base infrastructure on which a Level 2 design from the real project according to design 

--- Document Chunk 1823 ---
version 2.0 of February 2024. This is infra scenario I-0. 

--- Document Chunk 1824 ---
2. The first HTD design, numbered I-1, is based on the base L2 design of I -0 and assumes a 

--- Document Chunk 1825 ---
headway of approximately 1 minute without buffer times still reachable on the TTD for 

--- Document Chunk 1826 ---
degraded situations and behind trains without TIM. This leads to a reduction of 50 % axle 

--- Document Chunk 1827 ---
counters as a result of the following assumptions: 

--- Document Chunk 1828 ---
• Physical blocks of ~ 2 km on tracks without regular freight traffic, given passenger 

--- Document Chunk 1829 ---
trains running at 140 km/h 

--- Document Chunk 1830 ---
• Physical blocks of 0,5 – 1 km on tracks with regular freight traffic, given freight trains 

--- Document Chunk 1831 ---
running at 100 km/h 

--- Document Chunk 1832 ---
• Some shorter physical blocks near stations 

--- Document Chunk 1833 ---
• No additional virtual blocks 

--- Document Chunk 1834 ---
3. The second HTD -design, numbered I-4, is the base infrastructure with only a minimum 

--- Document Chunk 1835 ---
number of axle counters, always near other physical objects (switches and level crossings).

--- Document Chunk 1844 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 1845 ---
This leads in the worst case to trains running only at station distance in degraded situations 

--- Document Chunk 1846 ---
or behind trains without TIM. 

--- Document Chunk 1847 ---
The distance of virtual blocks can be varied in 2 gradations: 

--- Document Chunk 1848 ---
• The base infrastructure from scenario I -1 or I -4 with additional virtual blocks to further 

--- Document Chunk 1849 ---
optimise capacity. The virtual blocks are 200 -250 meters apart (usually by splitting the 

--- Document Chunk 1850 ---
designed TTD -blocks in 2 VSS). This fits to a headway of approximately the t imetable 

--- Document Chunk 1851 ---
resolution of 6 s for the shortest and fastest trains. These scenarios get the numbers I-2 and 

--- Document Chunk 1852 ---
I-5. 

--- Document Chunk 1853 ---
• The infrastructure from scenarios I-2 and I-5 with additional virtual blocks to further optimise 

--- Document Chunk 1854 ---
capacity. The virtual blocks are 100-125 meters apart. This fits to a headway of approximately 

--- Document Chunk 1855 ---
half the timetable resolution of 3 s for the shortest and fastest trains. These scenarios get the 

--- Document Chunk 1856 ---
numbers I-3 and I-6. 

--- Document Chunk 1857 ---
This leads to the total of 7 infrastructure scenarios, numbered I-0 to I-6, as shown in Table 18.

all scenarios in which the distance between virtual blocks are varied only on the “Flevo” line between

Muiderberg Aansluiting and Lelystad (note that the Flevo Line is the northeastern part of the SAAL

5.13.2 Traffic  

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
The SAAL-corridor contains high density mixed traffic of intercities and regional trains in an hour -

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
pattern, including two international paths and two freight paths. In Figure 17, the line plan is 

--- Document Chunk 1975 ---
described. Between Schiphol and Lelystad, and between Schiphol and Hilversum, an intercity 

--- Document Chunk 1976 ---
service runs every 15 minutes. Furthermore, there are 6 Sprinters an hour between Almere and 

--- Document Chunk 1977 ---
Amsterdam Centraal, 4 Sprinters between Hilversum and  Amsterdam Centraal and 2 Sprinters 

--- Document Chunk 1978 ---
between Hilversum and Almere. Finally, 4 Sprinter trains run from Amsterdam Zuid to Lelystad that 

--- Document Chunk 1979 ---
do not stop at local stations between Weesp and Lelystad.  

--- Document Chunk 1980 ---
Freight paths are also part of this corridor and run twice every hour between Amsterdam Bijlmer and 

--- Document Chunk 1981 ---
Hilversum. International paths are part of regular intercity traffic on this corridor. One of the four 

--- Document Chunk 1982 ---
intercities to Lelystad runs from Brussels, and one of the intercities to Amersfoort continues to Berlin. 

--- Document Chunk 1983 ---
In this study, these trains are considered as regular national intercities.  

--- Document Chunk 1984 ---
The intercities run in a strict 15-minute interval, while all other trains are evenly divided in this interval.  

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
This leads to multiple short headways. Between Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid a train runs every 

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
2.5 - 3 minutes without exception. The most restr icting part of the OV -SAAL network is between 

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
Weesp and Almere. This time-distance diagram is visualized in Figure 18, in which the intercities are 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
shown in blue. The local trains from Amsterdam Zuid run non -stop between Weesp and Almere. 

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
Together with all Sprinters, the structure is described from Weesp to Almere as follows: Intercity, 

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
local train from Amsterdam Centraal, local train from Amsterdam Zuid, local train from Amsterdam 

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
Centraal or Hilversum, Intercity. Almost all headways on Weesp and Almere are planned at 2.5 

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
minutes.

5.13.3 General assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
There are several assumptions specific for the Dutch network that are described in this section. All 

--- Document Chunk 2016 ---
of these are used to increase the applicability for the Dutch system.  

--- Document Chunk 2017 ---
The rolling stocks we use for passenger trains are ICNG -13 (Intercity Nieuwe Generatie) for all 

--- Document Chunk 2018 ---
intercities in Flevoland and Hilversum, and SNG -10 (Sprinter Nieuwe Generatie) for all local trains 

--- Document Chunk 2019 ---
and express trains. 

--- Document Chunk 2020 ---
Running time supplements are applied in the timetable, and therefore need to be incorporated in the 

--- Document Chunk 2021 ---
simulation as well. The running time supplement is described as a percentage of the technical 

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
running time. The OV-SAAL timetable uses  7% for all intercities, and 6% for all local trains and 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
express trains.  

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
A buffer time of 60 seconds is applied to all passenger trains. This practically means that every 

--- Document Chunk 2025 ---
section is occupied 60 seconds after a train has left that specific section. We use this method on all 

--- Document Chunk 2026 ---
scenarios. This value is used in order to have an additional buffer between two trains in the timetable  

--- Document Chunk 2027 ---
for the purpose of robustness, when they have to occupy the same infrastructure shortly behind each 

--- Document Chunk 2028 ---
other.

The freight paths we consider run from Kijfhoek, through Weesp to Amersfoort and further, in both 

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
directions. These trains have a length of 720 metres, carry 2400 tonnes and are propelled by one 

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
BR189. Freight trains do not run with a running time supplement and do not use a buffer time.  

--- Document Chunk 2043 ---
We consider two types of dwell time. The first is the dwell time at small stations. On these, local 

--- Document Chunk 2044 ---
trains will dwell for 30 seconds and intercities dwell for 54 seconds. Those are the technical minimum 

--- Document Chunk 2045 ---
dwell time based both on realisation data and proces analysis of the dwell procedure. On larger 

--- Document Chunk 2046 ---
stations, a larger value is used based on both realisation data and robustness measures. We use a 

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
list made by ProRail that includes all intercity stations and differs for Sprinters and Intercities.  

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---

5.13.4 Scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 2050 ---
We propose 7 timetable scenarios numbered with “T -” to assess the impact on capacity and 

--- Document Chunk 2051 ---
robustness. The scenarios outlined in Table 19 are based on the areas to simulate specified in Table 

--- Document Chunk 2052 ---
18. Scenarios T-1 and T-3 are analysed for both the SAAL corridor and the Flevo Line, whereas T-

--- Document Chunk 2053 ---
2 is analysed exclusively for SAAL. Scenarios T -4, T-5, T-6, and T -7 are analysed solely for the 

--- Document Chunk 2054 ---
Flevo Line.  The combination of the infrastructure scenarios and timetable scenarios lead to 31 

--- Document Chunk 2055 ---
combinations as depicted in Table 19. In all timetable scenarios except for T -3 the assumption is 

--- Document Chunk 2056 ---
that all regular passenger trains have a TIM. 

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---

6 CONCLUSIONS 

--- Document Chunk 2088 ---
The goal of this deliverable is to describe the test specification requirements for ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 2089 ---
Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), also known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), to be considered in EU Rail FP1 

--- Document Chunk 2090 ---
WP8 and of which the capacity and robustness effects according to the specified performance 

--- Document Chunk 2091 ---
indicators will be calculated in EU Rail FP1 WP9.  The methodology, case studies and scenarios 

--- Document Chunk 2092 ---
have been reviewed by partners from EU Rail FP1 WP8, that are now making preparations to 

--- Document Chunk 2093 ---
execute the required scenarios for WP9. 

--- Document Chunk 2094 ---
The scenarios are provided for seven Spanish case studies, two case studies in France, three in 

--- Document Chunk 2095 ---
Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The Spanish cases cover all five market segments: high-speed, 

--- Document Chunk 2096 ---
mainline (mixed traffic), (sub-)urban, regional and freight. They are exploratory of the headway 

--- Document Chunk 2097 ---
performance indicator. The insights can be used further in t he French, Swedish and Dutch cases, 

--- Document Chunk 2098 ---
that cover the high-speed, mainline (mixed traffic) and (sub-)urban market segments. They use also 

--- Document Chunk 2099 ---
relative capacity utilisation as a measure in order to evaluate the capacity from a line and network 

--- Document Chunk 2100 ---
perspective. Finally, two cases from Sweden (Southern mainline) and the Netherlands  (SAAL -

--- Document Chunk 2101 ---
corridor) will be used to evaluate HTD-designs for their robustness by adding a deterministic delay 

--- Document Chunk 2102 ---
to a single train. This is measured by the performance indicators: recovery time, number of affected 

--- Document Chunk 2103 ---
trains and total delay in the system. 

--- Document Chunk 2104 ---
The scenarios are built specifically around logical combinations of infrastructure and traffic. In the 

--- Document Chunk 2105 ---
infrastructure, the variance lies in the number and positioning of trackside train detection and the 

--- Document Chunk 2106 ---
virtual subsections in between. In the traffic the variance is possible in the share and types of trains 

--- Document Chunk 2107 ---
that are equipped to fully utilise HTD by having a Train Integrity Monitor on board. 

--- Document Chunk 2108 ---
The results of the calculations of EU Rail FP1 WP9 will be used in the development and evaluation 

--- Document Chunk 2109 ---
of the method for track layout with ETCS HTD, that will be described in deliverable 37.2 of this work 

--- Document Chunk 2110 ---
package. Another evaluation of the results will be performed in EU Rail FP2 WP32, where different 

--- Document Chunk 2111 ---
DATO-concepts are compared.
