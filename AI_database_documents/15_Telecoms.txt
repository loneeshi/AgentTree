Back to basics: 

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
Telecoms part 1

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
This ‘Back to basics’ article covers the 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
subject of railway telecommunications. As 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
with other such articles, our intention is 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
to provide an overview for IRSE members 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
new to the industry or who may not have 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
experience of working in this specific area. 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
The content may also be useful for people 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
studying for the IRSE Exam. The objective is 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
to describe the subject in a generic manner 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
and we have used examples based mainly 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
on UK main line railways. Part 1 covers 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
telecoms networks and part 2 in another 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
issue of IRSE News will look at telecoms for 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
passenger use. 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
Communication is essential to all businesses 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
including railways and without telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
services trains would not run effectively. It is 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
possible for trains to move without signalling, 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
but communications are necessary for efficient 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
operation. Railway telecoms covers voice, data 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
and radio for rail operations, rail business, and 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
passenger use. It can also cover commercial 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
telecoms services for some railways. 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
Role of operational telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
Operational telecoms systems have four 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
roles for a railway:

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
• To facilitate normal day-to-day voice and 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
data communications. This includes links 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
to support the operation of signalling and 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
electrification systems.

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
• To facilitate quick communications in the 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
event of a problem or hazard.

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
• To facilitate communications of those 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
attending an accident.

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
• To provide bearer services for other 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
systems to enable communications where 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
and when required.

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
Normal day-to-day operational verbal 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
communication includes the use by signallers to 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
give instructions to drivers to move their trains 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
in the event of a signalling system failure and to 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
persons wishing to use level crossings. They are 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
also used to take and give back line possessions 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
and grant electric traction isolations for 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
emergencies and to facilitate engineering works. 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
“Without 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
communications 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
trains cannot 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
move”

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
It also includes day-to-day conversations to plan 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
train movements and manage the railway. In all 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
these cases it is very important that the receiver of 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
the instruction correctly interprets the instruction 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
in order to carry it out. Most railways do this by the 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
use of a voice protocol which requires messages 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
to be repeated back. However, for the telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
service it is important that the voice channel is 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
clear and of sufficient volume to enable messages 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
to be understood. Also, if the display system 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
shows the location or role of the users then this 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
must be proven correct, as far as is practical, since 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
credible but incorrect information could mislead a 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
user into making an incorrect decision or miss-

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
understanding the context of the message being 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
passed. A misinterpretation of an operational 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
message can result in an incorrect action and 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
potentially lead to a hazardous situation.

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
When there is a hazardous situation it needs to 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
be rectified, often with trains being stopped, 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
before an accident occurs. Railway telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
radio systems have a key role in managing such 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
situations where trains need to be stopped. Trains 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
may need to quickly alert the signaller of a hazard 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
and request assistance. The person becoming 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
aware of the hazard needs to be able to contact 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
all trains in the immediate area quickly and easily, 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
and instruct the drivers to bring their trains to a 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
stop. Time is of the essence in passing this type 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
of message. Even if the train cannot be brought 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
to a stand before the collision, a reduction 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
in speed can significantly reduce the impact 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
of the accident.

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
If there is an accident it is important that the 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
emergency services can be contacted quickly to 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
help with recovery and reach any injured people. 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
In many cases the emergency services provide 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
their own communications systems but when 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
access distances are extended, for example in 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
sub-surface stations, tunnels, or remote locations, 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
the equipment to allow the emergency services to 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
extend their normal radio systems may need to be 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
provided by the railway.

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
Voice communications by telephone

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
Some railways provide lineside telephones for the 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
public at level crossings so they can contact the 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
signaller in an emergency or to obtain permission 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
to cross the track. Other lineside phones may also 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
be provided to facilitate engineering or operational 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
activities, although these are often undertaken 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
using a public or railway specific radio system. 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
Lineside telephones are normally analogue 300-

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
3400Hz in operation and connected via a twisted 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
copper pair in a cable to the nearest signal box or 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
transmission node. No power supply is required 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
at the telephone location, as it is powered over 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
the copper circuit, at normally 50V DC. This is 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
known as Central Battery (CB) working. When a 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
user wishes to establish a call, they lift the handset, 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
which places a 600Ω loop on the pair. This allows 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
a current to flow which is detected at the far end. 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
The actual loop current will be dependent on the 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
resistance of the copper circuit and will decrease 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
with distance. Depending on the use of the 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
telephone, the far end may route the call directly 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
to the signaller and return ringing tone to the user. 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
This is a point-to-point telephone circuit and is 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
commonly used for level crossings. Alternatively, 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
the far end may return dial tone which tells the 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
user to enter the number for the extension or 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
service they require. The number is normally sent 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
as a sequence of multi-frequency tones which 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
are decoded at the far end and used to route 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
the call to the required destination. Once the 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
far end answers the call, a duplex speech path is 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
established back to the initiator and conversations 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
can take place. When the user wishes to terminate 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
the call, he replaces the handset which removes 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
the loop. If a phone needs to be rung, an AC 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
ringing current typically 75V at 25Hz is applied 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
to the line. The current is interrupted to give the 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
distinctive ringing cadence. The telephone will be 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
rung by this current until the handset is lifted and 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
the loop applied. At this point the ringing current is 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
removed and the speech circuit established.

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
Copper cable

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
Telephones will normally be connected via a 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
two pair ‘tail cable’ to a lineside location or 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
connection box where the circuit is connected 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
to the main line side cable. Copper cables come 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
in many varieties as the number of pairs can vary 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
from single pairs to hundreds of pairs and the 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
conductor size can vary from typically 0.63mm or 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
0.9mm gauge (diameter) to much bigger sizes on 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
older copper cables. Each pair is twisted together 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
“If there is an 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
accident it is 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
important that 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
the emergency 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
services can 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
be contacted 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
quickly”

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
Telecommunications 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
are essential for the safe 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
and smooth operation of 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
railways worldwide. The 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
people upon which the 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
network depends work in 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
different roles, and have 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
different needs of their 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
equipment.

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
to reduce crosstalk from other circuits in the cable 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
and from external sources. In cables with many 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
pairs, these are arranged in layers. A system of 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
colour coding is used so that each pair and the 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
conductors forming each pair (known as legs) 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
can be individually identified. The copper pairs 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
are normally protected by a moisture barrier and 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
petroleum jelly to prevent water ingress, and an 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
insulating sheath, which can be zero halogen and 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
low smoke if required for underground locations. 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
Some older copper cables were provided with a 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
steel armoured layer for electrification traction 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
immunisation purposes, but this is now normally 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
provided by a separate screening conductor. The 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
sheath is normally marked with information so that 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
cables can be identified. 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
Telecoms copper cables can be used to carry 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
DC signalling circuits, but not vice versa as 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
conventional signalling cables are not constructed 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
with twisted pairs since they are designed for only 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
DC circuits. If a telecoms cable is used to carry 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
both telecoms and signalling circuits it is normally 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
recommended to fully terminate all the cable pairs 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
in every trackside location case, using a method 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
which facilitates easy identification of pairs, testing 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
and isolation. For good quality speech and data 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
services, a telecoms cable will require a cable 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
insulation resistance of several megohms, which is 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
far higher than needed for a DC signalling circuit. 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
Fibre cables 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
The introduction of fibre optics revolutionised 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
telecoms cable networks for railways. Fibre optic 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
cables are small and light (compared to copper 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
multipair cables) and can be used to transmit very 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
high data rates (several 100Gbit/s) and are immune 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
from electrical interference. The distance between 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
transmission nodes can be increased significantly 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
compared to copper cabling.

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
Fibres carry short wavelength light pulses and 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
are used in conjunction with digital transmission 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
systems. Early fibre cables were multimode 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
graded-index but were quickly superseded by 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
single mode fibre using 1310 nanometre (nm) 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
wavelength with improved attenuation and 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
bandwidth. Multimode cable remains cheaper 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
and can still be used on short haul applications, 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
typically in buildings. Early cables typically 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
contained 8 or 10 fibres positioned within a loose 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
tube construction with a Kevlar® central strength 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
member with no metallic elements. Fibre count 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
within cables has increased and cables containing 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
hundreds of fibres in several tubes are now 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
available. Fibre cables, being much smaller than 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
copper equivalents, can be rolled on to a drum in 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
much greater lengths, requiring less joints when 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
installed trackside. Care has to be taken however 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
during design and installation not to bend the fibre 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
cable too tightly around corners.

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
The essential tools for working on fibre are 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
a fusion splicer and an Optical Time Domain 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
Reflectometer (OTDR). A splicer effectively 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
heats and welds the fibre together. Early models 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
required the jointer to align the two ends 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
mechanically using a built-in microscope but now 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
the process is automated. The OTDR is used to 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
send pulses of light down a fibre and measure any 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
reflection that occurs, to identify any problems 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
that might be present in the cable. A clean cut is 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
easy to locate but a poor joint or deteriorating 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
fibre connection will result in a higher reflection 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
reading, with the OTDR indicating the distance 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
to the problem.

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
Spare network bandwidth can also be leased 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
to others for commercial telecoms purposes, 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
if permitted by the national legislation 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
covering commercial telecoms. This could 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
include individual fibres or capacity in railway 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
telecoms cable routes leased to third parties. 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
Any lease agreements will need to take into 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
account the priority of telecoms services 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
for railway operational purposes and the 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
maintenance arrangements. 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
Concentrators

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
At the signal box there will be an operator 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
interface, sometimes called a “concentrator”, to 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
which all the lineside phones and other phones 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
are connected e.g. phone connections to 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
adjacent signal boxes, electrical control rooms 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
and operational control rooms. When a phone 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
is ringing in, an appropriate light flashes or the 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
display is changed to show which phone it is. 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
The signaller can choose which line to answer by 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
lifting his handset and selecting the particular line. 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
He can also ring a phone by lifting the handset 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
and pressing the appropriate button. In some 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
railways, phone lines for some level crossings 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
give a distinctive different ringing sound so the 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
signaller can take quicker action. Sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
the signaller’s handset is equipped with a press-

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
to-talk button so that the driver can only hear 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
what is said by the signaller to the handset and 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
not hear conversations on other lines. There are 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
many versions of concentrators based on the 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
technology available when they were brought 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
into service. Some have a key and lamp for each 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
line, others are based on touch screens telephone 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
systems similar to those used in money markets 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
and known as ‘dealer boards’. Some combine the 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
radio and fixed lines on the same display as the 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
signalling controls. Modern concentrators are 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
based on computers that communicate using the 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
Internet Protocol (IP) see later.

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
If the signal box and phone are separated by an 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
appreciable distance, say over 15km (10 miles), 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
then a transmission system will be needed to 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
extend the circuit. This is covered later. 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
Voice communication by radio

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
UHF (Ultra High Frequency) radios are generally 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
used for station management, shunting and to 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
facilitate engineering work. Some are used as 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
‘back-to-back’ radios and some have base stations 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
which allow the connection of a landline from, say 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
the signal box. UHF radios are normally simplex so 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
each user has to press a button when they wish 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
to talk and release to listen. Individual radios are 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
distinguished by callsigns and strict voice protocol 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
is required as a licence condition. When used by 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
a shunter to give instructions to a driver, some 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
radios have a facility to transmit a confidence 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
tone so the driver knows the shunter still wishes 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
them to continue or else the shunter has to keep 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
“Telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---

--- Document Chunk 305 ---

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
to carry DC

--- Document Chunk 309 ---

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
repeating the instruction. For engineering work 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
public radio networks are often used if there is 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
coverage at the location. 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
Many railways have or are installing their own 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
national radio networks to the GSM-R standard. 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
This system is based on the 2G version of public 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
networks with some extra enhanced facilities:

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
• Railway Emergency Call (REC).

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
• Prioritisation for important calls.

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
• Location dependent addressing e.g. contact 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
the signaller who controls the section of line 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
for the train making the call.

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
• Functional dependent addressing e.g. contact 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
the driver of train number 50629.

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
• Voice group calls e.g. a shunting group.

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
• Data services e.g. European Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
System (ETCS) data.

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
Figure 1 shows a schematic of typical GSM-R 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
system. GSM-R systems have dedicated spectrum  

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
which is harmonised across Europe as: Uplink  

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
876–880MHz for mobile transmission and 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
Downlink 921–925MHz for mobile reception.

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
Radio coverage is critical to the success of a 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
GSM-R system. Many issues affect radio coverage, 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
including cuttings, trees, hills, mast height and 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
the frequency used. A public mobile system radio 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
coverage will be optimised for revenue and it may 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
be acceptable for small areas to have no coverage. 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
For a railway radio network, complete coverage 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
along a line of route will be required, including all 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
cuttings, bridges and tunnels. 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
It makes a significant difference to radio coverage 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
design if a network is being designed for vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
mounted mobile radios or hand held portable 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
radios, as the former can have the antennas 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
mounted on the train or vehicle roof and have 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
higher power levels. As a train passes along 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
a section of route it reselects the next base 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
station to monitor based on the “neighbour list” 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
transmitted from each base station and the relative 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
received signal strengths of each neighbour and 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
the currently selected base station. 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
In a public network it does not matter which 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
base station is used for a call, but for a railway 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
emergency call it is important as it is established 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
around the GSM-R cell which the train mobile 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
had selected before the call set up, to make sure 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
a call is routed to the controlling signaller. Thus, 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
the control of the reselection is important and 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
needs careful design of frequency allocation 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
and neighbour lists, especially when there is a 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
parallel railway close by. Frequency allocations 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
also have to take account of any noise which 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
may be introduced by the receivers picking up 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
signals on the same or adjacent frequencies 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
from other masts in the area. In addition, to 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
reduce the size and hence impact of a railway 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
emergency call, operators normally want to be 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
able to distinguish between trains on the various 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
lines approaching busy junctions with often the 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
base station mast covering three or more sections 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
of line approaching a junction. This has to be 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
achieved using only a small number of frequencies 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
compared to a public GSM system. In Europe only 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
19 are currently available for GSM-R.

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
It is also important for the handover of calls to 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
occur robustly so as to not interrupt speech 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
or data communications. This handover takes 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
time and therefore the handover zone has to

may be required in large stations, cuttings, under 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
bridges and tunnels. 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
A common problem to almost all railways is 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
providing radio communications in tunnels. 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
Communication using a tunnel mounted aerial 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
in a single bore tunnel at 450MHz is possible 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
up to around 500m, whilst it can reach 1.5km 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
in a double track tunnel. At the higher band 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
frequency of 900MHz the distance increases to 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
around 2km or more for double track tunnels. 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
The tunnel dimensions become significant as 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
greater propagation distances have been found in 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
the tunnels on the high-speed lines in Germany, 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
which are built to a more generous loading gauge 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
than other railways, such as the UK. 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
The effect of introducing a train into the tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
is to increase the attenuation rate due to the 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
blocking presence of the train. In a single 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
bore tunnel this can be a significant problem, 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
depending on the tunnel dimensions. In a double 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
track tunnel the effect may become significant 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
when trains are passing. At certain frequencies 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
some tunnels can act as waveguides, which 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
can lessen the rate of field strength attenuation 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
through the tunnel. Factors that can increase the 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
rate of attenuation include the presence of bends 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
in the tunnel and the construction of the tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
(concrete, brick or rock-lined).

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
The space occupied by trains in the tunnel is 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
also important. In tunnels with no overhead line 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
electrification and a restricted clearance, for 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
example, the distance radio waves propagate 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
is lower than comparable tunnels with a larger 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
gap between the roof of the train and the 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
tunnel ceiling.

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
The alternative approach to the use of free-space 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
antenna propagation is to use leaky feeders or 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
radiating cables. These have the advantage of 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
having a consistent and generally predictable level 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
of attenuation, which is not affected by passing 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
trains. The cable is ‘leaky’ in that it has gaps or 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
slots in its outer conductor which unbalances the 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
radio signal in the cable and causes it to propagate 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
radio frequencies along its entire length. 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
Work is underway on the replacement for 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
GSM-R, called FRMCS (Future Railway Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
Communication System) but it is expected that 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
the current GSM-R functionality will be carried 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
forward to the new system.

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
Data

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
Railway telecoms does not just use voice as data 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
circuits are required to allow remote control 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
and monitoring of equipment. Data circuits are 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
provided to support signalling systems, e.g. SSI, 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
Westlock, Smartlock when long distance terminals 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
are required. Data circuits can be supported over 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
copper cables using modems or plug directly into 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
transmission equipment.

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
The near continuous data connection between 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
trains and control centre to support the European 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
Train Control System (ETCS) is normally provided 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
via a GSM-R network in Europe and beyond. 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
Railways, particularly metros, that use other cab 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
based signalling systems (e.g. Communications 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
Based Train Control CBTC) may adopt an 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
alternative radio system such as TErrestrial Trunked 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
Radio (TETRA) or even Wi-Fi if the line is in tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
where external interference can be controlled. 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
Early versions of ETCS used circuit switched data 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
and hence required a constant data connection 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
circuit to be available for the whole journey. This 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
causes problems in dense areas where many 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
trains are trying to access the network. To address 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
this, some GSM-R networks are being enhanced 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
to support GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
which allows better use of the radio bandwidth. 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
Packet and circuit switching are explained later in 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
the IP section. 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
SCADA Systems

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
systems can be used to monitor and control many 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
different processes and systems for railways. 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
However, the primary railway application is the 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
control of electric traction systems over wide 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
areas. Telecoms data links with high availability 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
will be required for electric traction SCADA system 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
control, together with robust voice services 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
for routine and emergency isolation purposes. 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
Tunnels require 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
significant consideration 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
when providing radio 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
communications.

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
Eliminating common failures which could isolate 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
more than one successive electrical supply site is 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
important, so an emergency isolation can still be 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
implemented. SCADA systems may also be used 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
for the monitoring and control of ancillary systems 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
such as lifts and escalators, ventilation and air-

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
conditioning and drainage systems and will also 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
require telecoms links.

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
Traditionally signalling telemetry systems are 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
generally not regarded as SCADA systems but 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
they perform a very similar function, transmitting 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
commands and receiving indications on the status 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
of signals, points, track circuits. However in some 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
railways SCADA capable equipment is used for 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
signalling remote control systems. 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
Transmission systems

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
Transmission systems are used to transmit 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
and receive more information than a single 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
cable pair or fibre and over longer distances. 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
They have evolved over time, mainly driven by 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
developments for public telephone networks. 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
Nowadays transmission systems are normally 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
designed in layers to reflect the capacity and 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
points of presence for the different services. 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
The core network layer has relatively few nodes 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
connected by high speed links and configured 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
in a diverse manner. The access layer, on the 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
other hand, would have frequent nodes situated 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
where services are required, e.g. at base stations 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
or signal boxes. 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
Transmission equipment is normally connected 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
using lineside fibre cables, but older systems may 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
still be connected by copper cable. To provide 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
diversity transmission equipment can also be 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
connected by a service provided from a public 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
telephone operator. 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
Primary layers and primary 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
multiplexers

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
Older telecoms and data transmission systems, 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
such as Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
known as “circuit switched” transmission, with a 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
permanent connection established between two 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
applications. The primary layer is where channels 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
are converted from analogue to digital form so 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
they can be combined with other circuits and 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
sent around the network. When the primary layer 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
is connected to line side cables, this is normally 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
done using a primary multiplexer (PMux). PMuxs 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
can support, speech circuits and data circuits up 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
to 2Mbit/s. PMuxs are connected using an E1 data 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
stream at 2Mbit/s. PMuxs can be configured as 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
point to point or in rings. Each E1 data stream has 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
32 timeslots. Timeslot (TS) 0 is for synchronisation 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
and alarms and normally TS16 is used for channel 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
associated signalling. The other 30 timeslots each 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
of 64kbit/s can be used to support speech or 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
data circuits. The main interface cards used on a 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
railway network may be:

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
• Subscriber – to connect to a phone via the 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
lineside cable.

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
• Exchange – to connect to the exchange 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
or concentrator.

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
• 4-wire E&M – to provide transmit and receive 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
paths and up to 4 status circuits which can be 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
used to operate relays.

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
• G703 data interface for SSI.

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
• V24 or X21 for lower speed data.

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
• ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) for 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
some terminal equipment.

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
A normal telephone circuit has a frequency range 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
of 300-3400Hz. A PMux converts analogue 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
speech into a digital form by sampling the sound 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
every 125μS (i.e. 8kHz) and then converting 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
the sample value to a digital number between 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
-128 and 128 i.e. 8bits. This conversion is called 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
quantising and is done to limit the noise due to 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
the process to a small proportion of the amplitude 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
of the signal. So, the overall bit rate by channel is 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
8bits/sample x 8000samples/second = 64kbits/s. 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
The interface card then allocates this data stream 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
into a timeslot of the E1 circuit. In addition, it 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
detects items such as the loop condition or 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
ring current and sends codes in timeslot 16 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
to enable the interface card at the far end to 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
reproduce the condition.

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
PMuxs are normally connected via bearer services 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
through the higher order transmission layers but 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
can also be supported using Digital Subscriber 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
Line (DSL) modems over lineside copper networks. 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
A typical network configuration based on SDH 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
equipment is shown in Figure 2.

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
To connect a circuit switched network to an 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
Internet Protocol (IP) network, gateways are 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
required to convert the circuits or E1 data 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
streams into a set of packets to send round 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
the network. Data circuits for some signalling 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
applications (example SSI) have specific time delay 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
requirements which need to be addressed in the 

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
design of the core network and require allocation 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
rules for such circuits, or for the E1 data streams 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
supporting the circuits.

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
Figure 3 shows a typical example of how lineside 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
phones may be connected to a signal box, using 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
older circuit switched transmission.

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
Internet Protocol (IP) networks

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
IP (Internet Protocol) as its name suggests is 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
the basic protocol used on the internet, but has 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
been the heart of all new telecoms networks and 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
data communications systems provided for a 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
number of years. 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
The PDH and SDH “circuit switched” transmission, 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
with a permanent connection established between 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
two applications, ‘locks up’ the communication 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
resource and is inefficient, as the transmission 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
path is used even when no data is being 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
transmitted. IP however is a “packet switched” 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
network, with the data message split into small 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
packets to share capacity and transmission paths 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
which are only used when data needs to be sent. 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
This requires ‘routing’ to be established for each 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
data exchange, however resilience is built in and 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
the communications resources are shared, making 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
IP far more efficient than circuit switching.

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
Each packet needs to be given information about 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
the destination, its origin, and other information, 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
to allow the data to be routed around a meshed 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
network of routers. An IP packet is shown in 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
Figure 4. The payload is a variable amount of data 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
to be transmitted and is typically a few kilobytes, 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
but can be up to 64 kilobytes. The IP header is 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
fixed at 20 bytes and contains a 32-bit source 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
and destination address as well as an indication 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
of the length of the overall packet. Other fields 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
provide a checksum, the version of IP being 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
used, and a simple type of service indicator. The 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
“time to live” field is used to set the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
number of hops between router nodes to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
unsuccessful delivered packets circulating and 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
clogging up the network. After the packet has 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
transferred its specified number of hops it is simply 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
discarded and ‘dies’.

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
The IP network as described in its raw state is 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
simply a “best effort network”, and there is no 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
guarantee of the packets arriving, or in which 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
order they arrive, and the network is what is 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
known as connectionless, so the transport layer

Control Protocol (TCP) sits within the IP payload 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
and envelopes the source data by a 20-bit header 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
and is carried by the IP packet as the payload. TCP 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
acts as a connection-ordinated protocol within 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
the connectionless network, it assumes the IP 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
network is unreliable and numbers the IP packets 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
or “datagrams” at the transmitting end of the link. 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
It examines the numbers at the receiving end and 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
requests the retransmission of any packets not 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
arriving within a specified period. The numbering 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
sequence is used to arrange the packets into the 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
correct order, and finally TCP monitors the flow of 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
packets getting through the network and adjusts 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
the launch rate accordingly.

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
A network of routers is shown in Figure 5 together 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
with the role of the TCP and IP headers. The 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
routers only examine the IP packet header, and 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
simply pass the datagram packet onto the next 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
router in the network, according to a table held 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
within the router. Multiple paths for the packets 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
are available so the transmission network is more 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
reliable and it is possible for consecutive packets 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
to be routed over different paths between router 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
nodes. Once the packets are delivered to their 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
end-point, the TCP assembles packets in the 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
correct sequence and requests the retransmission 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
of delayed or errored packets if required.

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
Not every application has the same requirements 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
for the delivery of IP packets. For example, when 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
transmitting a document or email it is critical 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
the entire data message is transmitted with no 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
corruption. It does not matter if it takes a few 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
milliseconds to receive the data message, so TCP 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
is used, which will request the re-transmission of 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
any missing or corrupt data packets. However, 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
a voice or video image signal is time critical 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
but very small gaps in the image or voice can 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
be tolerated, and may not even be noticed. 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
For these applications User Datagram Protocol 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
(UDP) is used. This assembles the data packets in 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
the correct order, but does not arrange for the 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
retransmission of corrupt or missing packets; they 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
are simply discarded. 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
MPLS is a method of providing a guaranteed 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
Quality of Service (QoS) and Virtual Private 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
Network (VPN) capability within an IP network, 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
and is a method of making the connectionless

‘labels’ to specify a virtual path for the IP packets 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
to follow using a 20-bit label attached to the front 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
of each packet. MPLS provides better latency for 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
time critical applications, such as voice and video, 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
and with VPN capability for security. The faster 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
routing is because the label switching is done in 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
hardware, whereas normal IP routing involves the 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
slower processing of software to deconstruct and 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
decode the IP address. MPLS also incorporates 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
Class of Service (CoS) network performance to 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
differentiate between time critical, high priority 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
traffic and delay tolerant, low priority traffic. To use 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
this service, MPLS capable routers are required.

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
Voice Over IP (VoIP)

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
VoIP systems offer many advantages compared to 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
a traditional circuit switched telephone exchange 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
network, as voice simply becomes another 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
application running on an IP network, this offers 

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
many advantages and the capability of exceptional 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
good quality sound. This is because high speed 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
codecs convert the voice to IP packets without 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
needing the normal 4kHz frequency filtering. 

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
This higher quality is subject to loading on the IP 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
network, which can lead to loss of packets and 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
hence degradation of sound quality; which is 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
why a high Quality of Service (QoS) IP network 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
is required for VoIP. A power supply for the VoIP 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
telephone will also be required. 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
Security is a concern with IP networks, so real time 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
cyber security using encryption and firewalls along 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
with “defence in depth” techniques with multiple 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
layers of defences is critical.

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
Protocol layers

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
One way of explaining the various IP 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
protocols and layers is to map TCP/IP and its 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
supporting protocols against the Open Systems 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
Interconnection (OSI) model as shown in Figure 6. 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
At physical Layer 0 and 1 there are the various 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
transmission systems and cables in the access and 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
core network. At Layer 2 there are various data 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
link systems that may be used in the telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
IP network, including Ethernet and possibly the 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
Public Switched Network for dial up connections. 

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
IP resides at Layer 3, the Network layer. At Layer 4, 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
the Transport Layer, there is either TCP for the 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
latency tolerable, or UDP for the latency intolerant 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
applications. There is a vast array of protocols 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
covering many possible applications that may run 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
over an IP network, either internet or intranet or 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
an IP based secure signalling system; and it is at 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
this level where full end to end data security needs 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
to be addressed. The design and standards for IP 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
and the internet are administered by a consortium 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
of users, academics, and manufacturers known 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
unlike traditional telecoms networks which were 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
designed to international standards governed by 

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
The IETF have set recommendations for OSI layers 

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
2 to 7, however the IETF considers layers 5 to 7 a 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
single entity. 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
Management of a telecoms network

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
Software-Defined Networks (SDN) are now 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
common. SDN enables remove dynamic, efficient 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
network configuration and alarm management 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
in order to improve network performance and 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
monitoring, making it more like cloud computing 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
than traditional network management.

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
In many cases modern business systems are based 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
on an IP network and the methods of connecting 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
computers, printers and servers are well defined. 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
VoIP telephones are increasingly used in offices 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
and if a railway telecoms IP network is provided 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
for operational use it is also possible to extend 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
it for business purposes. Interfaces may be 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
required to any older circuit switched digital 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
telephone exchanges which could still be used in 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
a railway network. 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
Increasing capacity

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM) 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
or Dense Wavelength Divisional Multiplexing 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
(DWDM) technology can be used to make better 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
use of installed fibre. These systems use Frequency 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
Division Multiplex (FDM) with between 18 and 160 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
wavelengths of light over single mode fibre. In this 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
way many transmission links can be overlaid onto 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
the same fibre, to significantly increase capacity.

Electrification, interference  

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
and immunisation

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
Electric traction systems can cause problems 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
for telecommunications with electromagnetic 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
induction of high voltages and noise into speech 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
circuits. This can arise from harmonics resulting 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
from the electric field generated by the current 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
drawn by electric trains in 25kV overhead line 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
systems, or by the AC feeder cables and the 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
crude rectification of the AC supply to provide 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
a DC traction system either using third rail or 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
overhead catenaries. S&T engineers have to 

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
ensure interference will not cause malfunction 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
of safety related circuits, particularly that short 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
circuit currents do not generate high voltages that 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
would damage equipment or cause a dangerous 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
health hazard to staff. Also, higher frequency 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
harmonics from traction systems should not cause 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
speech circuits to become noisy and interfere with 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
data circuits. 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
Various traction systems are in use around 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
the world with 25kV 50Hz one of the main 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
systems in use today. The ITU (International 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
Telecommunications Union) requires induced 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
voltages in telecoms copper cables under normal 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
conditions to be no more than 60V RMS, and 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
under system fault conditions 430V RMS. The 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
noise limit for telephone circuits is a psophometric 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
electromotive force of 1mV. Psophometric noise is 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
‘weighted’ the same as human-perceived levels of 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
noise. This is more important for telephony than 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
the raw noise voltage.

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
A range of solutions are required to mitigate 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
the effects of traction power supplies on 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
line side services:

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
• Limiting the lengths of copper cable section.

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
• Having a robust balance to earth interface for 

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
powered equipment.

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
• Position of the cable route (and hence cables) 

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
with respect to the traction cables.

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
• Providing an earthed screening cable in 

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
the cable route.

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
• Replace longer distance copper cabling with a 

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
fibre optic based system.

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
Some railways provide traction current at 25kV, 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
50Hz to the train with currents of around 300A 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
flowing through the train from the catenary wire 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
to the rails. To minimise interference, a booster 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
transformer is used whereby the overhead line 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
equipment (OHLE) is separated into in sections 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
of about 3km and at the end of the section a 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
Booster Transformer (BT) is used to ‘suck’ the 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
return current out the rails and into a separate 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
return conductor mounted on the outside of the 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
overhead stanchions roughly at the same height 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
as the catenaries. This creates an opposite phase 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
and opposing electric field that helps to cancel 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
out the effect of the current in the catenaries but 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
the effects of the currents within the occupied 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
overhead line section still need to be addressed. 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
More recent electrification projects use a 50kV 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
auto-transformer system whereby, a ‘second 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
catenary’ is mounted on the outside of the 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
stanchion to permit a 25kV-0-25kV arrangement 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
giving a more balanced system. Trains continue to 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
take power at the 25kV voltage with the current 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
being returned in the ‘other’ catenary wire. In this 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
way, for sections which do not have a train taking 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
power, the currents in the OHLE conductors are 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
the same magnitude but in opposite phase. This 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
means that at any point which is an equal distance 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
from both the conductors the induced magnetic 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
field will be effectively zero. This is the ideal place 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
for the cable route. It is not possible to directly 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
align with this ideal positioning as the catenary 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
wires move from side to side and go up and down 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
for obstacles such as bridges and level crossings. 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
However the nullifying effect still significantly 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
reduces the electric field. As has been mentioned 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
previously, the advent of fibre optic cables 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
with no metallic components has significantly 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
reduced the problem of electrical interference 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
and associated immunisation for new systems and 

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
in some cases may allow the use of simple feed 

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
catenary systems.

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
In part 2 of this article we will look at telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---

“Back to basics” and the IRSE Exam 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
We hope our “Back to basics” articles are 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
particularly interesting and useful to those 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
of you who are maybe new to the industry 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
and are working to build up your knowledge, 

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
or who have moved to a new role involving 

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
telecommunications. For those considering 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
taking the IRSE exam, these articles should be 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
particularly relevant to assist your studies. 

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
Part 2 of ‘back to basics’ for railway 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
telecommunications covers telecoms for 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
passenger or customer assistance. As with 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
other similar articles, the intention is to 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
provide an overview for IRSE members 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
new to the industry or who may not have 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
experience of working in this specific area. 

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
The content may also be useful for people 

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
studying for the IRSE Exam. The objective is 

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
to describe the subject in a generic manner 

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
and we have used examples based mainly on 

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
UK main line railways. 

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
Public Address (PA) 

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
PA systems have always been important for 

--- Document Chunk 1101 ---
communicating with customers and staff, and are 

--- Document Chunk 1102 ---
also used for emergency purposes when linked 

--- Document Chunk 1103 ---
to fire detection systems. A badly designed sound 

--- Document Chunk 1104 ---
system will quickly annoy customers and may 

--- Document Chunk 1105 ---
result in negative comments and poor publicity. 

--- Document Chunk 1106 ---
So, all sound systems should be designed by 

--- Document Chunk 1107 ---
competent sound communications engineers.

--- Document Chunk 1108 ---
A good PA system will depend on four 

--- Document Chunk 1109 ---
key requirements:

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
1. Loudness or sound pressure level. This 

--- Document Chunk 1111 ---
should be at a volume or level to please 

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
those intending to hear the communications 

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
message, but not too loud to annoy 

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
neighbours and residents close to a railway 

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
station, or train passengers who may not need 

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
to hear the announcement.

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
2. Intelligibility. This is one of the most important 

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
requirements of a PA system and where many 

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
systems fall short.

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
The concourse at 

--- Document Chunk 1121 ---
Birmingham New 

--- Document Chunk 1122 ---
Street station in 

--- Document Chunk 1123 ---
the UK is typical 

--- Document Chunk 1124 ---
of the challenging 

--- Document Chunk 1125 ---
environment for PA 

--- Document Chunk 1126 ---
designers.

--- Document Chunk 1127 ---
 IRSE News |  Issue 271  |  November 2020

--- Document Chunk 1128 ---
12

--- Document Chunk 1129 ---
3. Naturalness. A natural sounding PA system is 

--- Document Chunk 1130 ---
one where pre-recorded announcements will 

--- Document Chunk 1131 ---
sound the same or similar to real time voice 

--- Document Chunk 1132 ---
announcements. 

--- Document Chunk 1133 ---
4. Reliability. All PA systems need to have good 

--- Document Chunk 1134 ---
reliability and availability, with appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1135 ---
redundancy in their design, this is especially 

--- Document Chunk 1136 ---
important with voice alarm systems which may 

--- Document Chunk 1137 ---
have performance requirements mandated by 

--- Document Chunk 1138 ---
national legislation. 

--- Document Chunk 1139 ---
The first three requirements are dependent 

--- Document Chunk 1140 ---
on the acoustic environment, which can be 

--- Document Chunk 1141 ---
particularly challenging at railway stations with 

--- Document Chunk 1142 ---
variable building design and noisy trains. Sound 

--- Document Chunk 1143 ---
may be reflected, refracted, diffracted, absorbed 

--- Document Chunk 1144 ---
or transmitted through obstructions, dependent 

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
upon the material and size of the obstruction.

--- Document Chunk 1146 ---
A typical railway station will need careful design 

--- Document Chunk 1147 ---
of its speaker system to make the best of what 

--- Document Chunk 1148 ---
can be a very challenging acoustic environment. 

--- Document Chunk 1149 ---
The sound design engineer will need to consider: 

--- Document Chunk 1150 ---
the operating environment of the equipment in 

--- Document Chunk 1151 ---
terms of temperature, humidity and dust; security 

--- Document Chunk 1152 ---
of equipment; listed building consent as many 

--- Document Chunk 1153 ---
stations in some countries are protected buildings; 

--- Document Chunk 1154 ---
any noise abatement notices that may have been 

--- Document Chunk 1155 ---
served; density of nearby housing and residents; 

--- Document Chunk 1156 ---
platform possessions and isolations needed for 

--- Document Chunk 1157 ---
installation and maintenance; feedback from users 

--- Document Chunk 1158 ---
on the existing system, such as areas of poor 

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
coverage along with any customer complaints; 

--- Document Chunk 1160 ---
glass shelters, as these can attenuate sound by 

--- Document Chunk 1161 ---
approximately 25dB. 

--- Document Chunk 1162 ---
Coverage in general should be provided in all 

--- Document Chunk 1163 ---
areas where most customers stand when waiting 

--- Document Chunk 1164 ---
for information on train services or disruption, 

--- Document Chunk 1165 ---
and in all weather conditions. In Europe the 

--- Document Chunk 1166 ---
regulations for Persons with Reduced Mobility 

--- Document Chunk 1167 ---
(PRM) require PA coverage in all public areas of 

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
the station and the UK Equality Act 2010 requires 

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
all station operators to take reasonable steps to 

--- Document Chunk 1170 ---
ensure they do not discriminate against people 

--- Document Chunk 1171 ---
with reduced mobility.

--- Document Chunk 1172 ---
Loudness and intelligibility

--- Document Chunk 1173 ---
Station PA systems must be carefully designed 

--- Document Chunk 1174 ---
to avoid conflict between wanted and unwanted 

--- Document Chunk 1175 ---
noise, and simply specifying a sound pressure 

--- Document Chunk 1176 ---
level and intelligibility requirement may provide 

--- Document Chunk 1177 ---
a system acceptable for rail users, but one which 

--- Document Chunk 1178 ---
annoys nearby residents. There have been cases 

--- Document Chunk 1179 ---
where PA systems have been renewed with an 

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
overall lower volume, but with better intelligibility 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
resulting in more complaints from neighbours. An 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
extreme case resulted in a noise prohibition notice 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
and for the station PA system to be switched 

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
off until the problem was resolved. A detailed 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
investigation found a number of issues. The 

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
station at times was busy with announcements 

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
as frequent as every 30 seconds. A second issue 

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
was that some announcers took 34 seconds to 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
communicate the same information as other 

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
announcers did in 6 seconds. The solution 

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
consisted of a number of changes which included 

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
zoning of the system and establishing common 

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
scripts for all announcements. 

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
Ambient noise sensing continuously monitors the 

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---
changing ambient noise levels and adjusts the 

--- Document Chunk 1196 ---
audio level of the PA system. This is particularly 

--- Document Chunk 1197 ---
relevant for railway stations with wildly varying 

--- Document Chunk 1198 ---
background sound levels usually caused by trains. 

--- Document Chunk 1199 ---
The maximum volume of the PA will need to be 

--- Document Chunk 1200 ---
limited as some trains can be very loud and it may 

--- Document Chunk 1201 ---
not be possible to announce over the top of the 

--- Document Chunk 1202 ---
train noise for health and safety reasons. Storing 

--- Document Chunk 1203 ---
and transmitting an announcement when the 

--- Document Chunk 1204 ---
background noise is lower is something that can 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
be considered. 

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
Dividing a station public address system into 

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
defined zones can be helpful, particularly where 

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---
limiting the noise to neighbours is required with 

--- Document Chunk 1209 ---
only those zones selected being addressed. The 

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
output from the amplifier can be automatically 

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---
routed to the chosen zone or zones either by 

--- Document Chunk 1212 ---
using zone selection keys on a controller, or by a 

--- Document Chunk 1213 ---
stored speech system announcing the timetable 

--- Document Chunk 1214 ---
to only areas requiring the message. Simultaneous 

--- Document Chunk 1215 ---

--- Document Chunk 1237 ---
different parts of the station and using male and 

--- Document Chunk 1238 ---
female voices can help to distinguish between the 

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
messages but care must be taken to minimise the 

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
over hearing between zones.

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
A PA system can be used to feed directly to 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
hearing aid users using a specially designed 

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
induction loop amplifier and associated cable 

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
system. The engineering and design of induction 

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
loops is complex and is environment dependent 

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
– steel-constructed buildings can make it 

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
particularly difficult.

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
Background music can be used to fill the ‘silence’ 

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
between announcements and is sometimes used 

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
at less busy stations. If provided this should not 

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
be loud enough to be obtrusive, but should be 

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
adjusted so that it adds to the ambiance of the 

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
environment. Music should never be so loud that 

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
customers cannot communicate, or that advice 

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
given by station staff cannot be heard.

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
Voice alarm systems

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
Train operators have a duty to ensure the safety of 

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
customers at all times. When an emergency such 

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
as a fire or a security threat arises or whenever 

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
there is the need to evacuate a station this can 

--- Document Chunk 1261 ---
be best achieved by a speech announcement, 

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
rather than bells or sounders. The spoken word 

--- Document Chunk 1263 ---
can be ‘live’ from a microphone, or pre-recorded. 

--- Document Chunk 1264 ---
Stored announcements can be initiated by the 

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
station’s or an adjacent building’s fire alarm 

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---
installation. When the alarm is activated the 

--- Document Chunk 1267 ---
sound system automatically broadcasts the stored 

--- Document Chunk 1268 ---
emergency message. 

--- Document Chunk 1269 ---
Public Address Voice Alarm (PAVA) sound systems 

--- Document Chunk 1270 ---
designed to warn of danger normally require 

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
special fire-safe wiring and complete building 

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
coverage with approved loudspeakers sited to 

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
cover all public and staff areas. The provision of 

--- Document Chunk 1274 ---
auxiliary power sources, so that in the event of 

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
an AC mains supply failure, the sound system can 

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
continue to operate, will be required. In addition 

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
equipment redundancy, self-checking alarms, 

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
sound level and intelligibility requirements should 

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
be considered. 

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
Passenger (or Customer)

Information Displays

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
Visual PIS/CIS are now common in many railways. 

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
They generally originated with hand painted 

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
boards but migrated to using revolving printed 

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
‘flap’ displays installed at larger stations to increase 

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
the display content, either operated manually 

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
or using card reading machines. In the 1980s 

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
processor systems controlling monochrome 

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays started to 

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
be installed at smaller stations with ‘next train’ 

--- Document Chunk 1291 ---
platform displays and departure/arrival summary 

--- Document Chunk 1292 ---
displays. Flap displays were inflexible and required 

--- Document Chunk 1293 ---
extensive ‘re-flapping’ when timetable changes 

--- Document Chunk 1294 ---
were carried out. LCD displays originally using 

--- Document Chunk 1295 ---
a 7x5 dot matrix often replaced flap displays to 

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
increase flexibility although often with a poorer 

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
display readability. LED displays then replaced  

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
LCD at larger ‘main board’ displays and CRT 

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
platform displays to improve both readability and 

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
reliability. It is easier to read upper- and lower- 

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
case than all upper- case, which is why road signs 

--- Document Chunk 1302 ---
in most countries use upper- and lower- case. 

--- Document Chunk 1303 ---
Displays should therefore be able to display 

--- Document Chunk 1304 ---
information ideally in the train company font with 

--- Document Chunk 1305 ---
both upper- and lower-case text with proper 

--- Document Chunk 1306 ---
descenders, e.g. for “y” and “g”. 

--- Document Chunk 1307 ---
PIS/CIS systems consist of either a central or local 

--- Document Chunk 1308 ---
processor and controller for the displays, together 

--- Document Chunk 1309 ---
with power supplies and communication links to 

--- Document Chunk 1310 ---
and from the displays. These links have migrated 

--- Document Chunk 1311 ---
from RS422/RS232 to Ethernet and Wi-Fi, with 

--- Document Chunk 1312 ---
systems now controlled from real time signalling 

--- Document Chunk 1313 ---
control systems (usually the train describer) 

--- Document Chunk 1314 ---
and linked to comprehensive train timetable 

--- Document Chunk 1315 ---
systems. Systems can also provide real time train 

--- Document Chunk 1316 ---
information to third party mobile applications for 

--- Document Chunk 1317 ---
public use. Unfortunately, when train disruption is 

--- Document Chunk 1318 ---
severe and with no trains moving it can be difficult 

--- Document Chunk 1319 ---
to display train information at just the time it is 

--- Document Chunk 1320 ---
really required. It is hoped that traffic management 

--- Document Chunk 1321 ---
systems may be able to provide accurate 

--- Document Chunk 1322 ---
predictive information for displays in the future.

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
When designing and siting displays on stations 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
the structure gauge for the railway should be 

--- Document Chunk 1336 ---
complied with and take into account signal 

--- Document Chunk 1337 ---
sighting along with installation and maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 1338 ---
access, cable containment and power supply 

--- Document Chunk 1339 ---
requirements. Listed building consent may be 

--- Document Chunk 1340 ---
required, and if replacing an existing system 

--- Document Chunk 1341 ---
feedback from users of the system should be 

--- Document Chunk 1342 ---
obtained and analysed together with any customer 

--- Document Chunk 1343 ---
complaints. The footfall where most people 

--- Document Chunk 1344 ---
stand when waiting for a service in all weather 

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
conditions should be taken into account when 

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
designing the system, together with requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
for persons with reduced mobility. Future train 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
service changes should also be considered. 

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
Involving human factors specialists and local 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
operators will help to identify the location of 

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
displays to maximise their effectiveness. Double 

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
sided displays should be used where ever possible 

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
to maximise the network capability of the system. 

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
Some operators use scrolling displays, but 

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
these can be difficult for persons with sight and 

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
comprehension issues to read and understand. 

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
Displays which change but hold messages fixed 

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
for a short time are better.

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
Closed-circuit television 

--- Document Chunk 1360 ---
Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems provide 

--- Document Chunk 1361 ---
surveillance capabilities to improve safety, assist 

--- Document Chunk 1362 ---
railway and station operation, and to combat 

--- Document Chunk 1363 ---
crime and terrorism. A CCTV system links a 

--- Document Chunk 1364 ---
camera to a video monitor or receiving system 

--- Document Chunk 1365 ---
using a direct transmission system. This differs 

--- Document Chunk 1366 ---
from broadcast television where the signal is 

--- Document Chunk 1367 ---
transmitted over the air and viewed on screen. It 

--- Document Chunk 1368 ---
is important that CCTV systems provide quality 

--- Document Chunk 1369 ---
video images in an easily re-playable form to 

--- Document Chunk 1370 ---
third parties, such as law enforcement agencies. 

--- Document Chunk 1371 ---
This can be critical should there be a need to use 

--- Document Chunk 1372 ---
the images as evidence of a crime. This article 

--- Document Chunk 1373 ---
does not cover driver only operation or level 

--- Document Chunk 1374 ---
crossing CCTV systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1375 ---
CCTV technology is improving all the time with 

--- Document Chunk 1376 ---
better performance in areas such as digital 

--- Document Chunk 1377 ---
equipment options, data storage, component 

--- Document Chunk 1378 ---
miniaturisation, wireless communications, and 

--- Document Chunk 1379 ---
video image analysis. A CCTV system for a 

--- Document Chunk 1380 ---
railway may be part of a multi-layered security 

--- Document Chunk 1381 ---
system. Undertaking a comprehensive needs 

--- Document Chunk 1382 ---
assessment at the start of any project helps to 

--- Document Chunk 1383 ---
ensure all required functionality is identified. 

--- Document Chunk 1384 ---
Clear requirements, a comprehensive site survey, 

--- Document Chunk 1385 ---
compliance with legislation and proper equipment 

--- Document Chunk 1386 ---
selection will all contribute to the design of a 

--- Document Chunk 1387 ---
good CCTV system. 

--- Document Chunk 1388 ---
In order to properly implement a CCTV system 

--- Document Chunk 1389 ---
and to highlight any engineering, operational, 

--- Document Chunk 1390 ---
management and monitoring issues, the site-

--- Document Chunk 1391 ---
specific characteristics need to be assessed by 

--- Document Chunk 1392 ---
a knowledgeable multidisciplinary team with 

--- Document Chunk 1393 ---
the right level of expertise. This could include 

--- Document Chunk 1394 ---
operators, security personnel, power and 

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
structural engineers to identify key functional and 

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
operational needs and restrictions. Functional 

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
requirements will include determining the area of 

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
surveillance, locations or assets that will benefit 

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
from CCTV surveillance. Operational requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
will define what information and detail the 

--- Document Chunk 1401 ---
system will be expected to provide. Factors to 

--- Document Chunk 1402 ---
consider may include the viewing scope of the 

--- Document Chunk 1403 ---
area, the ability to recognise someone walking 

--- Document Chunk 1404 ---
through a barrier or door, and to read vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 1405 ---
registration numbers. 

--- Document Chunk 1406 ---
There are four key requirements that need to be 

--- Document Chunk 1407 ---
covered in the initial design.

--- Document Chunk 1408 ---
• Functional – to define the precise area of 

--- Document Chunk 1409 ---
camera coverage such as surveillance of 

--- Document Chunk 1410 ---
perimeters, storage areas, key assets and 

--- Document Chunk 1411 ---
entrances and exits.

--- Document Chunk 1412 ---
• Operational – to define the capabilities of the 

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
CCTV system components that will provide 

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
the expected information under all operating 

--- Document Chunk 1415 ---
conditions. These will include security, day and 

--- Document Chunk 1416 ---
night operation, lighting, weather conditions, 

--- Document Chunk 1417 ---
vibration and temperature changes. 

--- Document Chunk 1418 ---
• Infrastructure – to include installation 

--- Document Chunk 1419 ---
constraints for installing or accessing fibre 

--- Document Chunk 1420 ---
“Involving human 

--- Document Chunk 1421 ---
factors specialists 

--- Document Chunk 1422 ---

before any works commence.

--- Document Chunk 1451 ---
• Video retention – to define the video retention 

--- Document Chunk 1452 ---
and storage needs. These should take into 

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
account security and data protection, which 

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
may be subject to legislation.

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
Whenever possible, CCTV systems should be 

--- Document Chunk 1456 ---
included in the planning and design stage of 

--- Document Chunk 1457 ---
any new facility, building or asset to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
all necessary infrastructure requirements for 

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
the CCTV are adequately incorporated into 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
the overall design. Factors to consider in the 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
detailed design of any CCTV system include: the 

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
number and locations of cameras including lens 

--- Document Chunk 1463 ---
selection, cabling and cable containment together 

--- Document Chunk 1464 ---
with fixing arrangements; lighting levels for all 

--- Document Chunk 1465 ---
proposed camera coverage areas; unhindered 

--- Document Chunk 1466 ---
but secure camera access for both installation 

--- Document Chunk 1467 ---
and maintenance; no interference or blocking of 

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
signal sighting; power requirements, including 

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
appropriate separation of power and data 

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
cables to comply with standards and reduction 

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
of interference.

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
Inadequate power can be a problem with CCTV 

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
equipment and can often cause interference. 

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
Proper system performance requires a clean and 

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
reliable power source. Therefore, the design may 

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
need to specify power conditioning or backups, 

--- Document Chunk 1477 ---
to ensure the quality of the video across the 

--- Document Chunk 1478 ---
entire system is unaffected by primary power 

--- Document Chunk 1479 ---
source disruption. Placing low-voltage power 

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
components near high-voltage lines can induce 

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
currents in the low-voltage system, presenting 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
hazards. A power source located too far away 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
can cause power fluctuations and may require 

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
larger conductor sizes to reduce voltage drop. 

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
Therefore, it is advisable to locate the power 

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
source close to the CCTV control equipment 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
and to include an Uninterruptible Power Supply 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
(UPS) to protect equipment and ensure the power 

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
supply is stable. 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---
Older CCTV systems generally used co-axial 

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
cable to connect cameras to the control hub, 

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
but nowadays video transmission for CCTV is 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
normally via unshielded twisted pair (UTP) or fibre 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
cable. Many problems with video image quality 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
can be avoided by selecting the appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
transmission media and following manufacturer’s 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
recommended installation techniques and 

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
procedures. As CCTV technology has evolved, 

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
video transmission has progressed from analogue 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
to digital equipment, often with an Internet 

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
Protocol (IP) capability to transmit compressed 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
video as digital data. Some railways now mandate 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
all new CCTV systems will use IP, but analogue 

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
systems using digital recording are still used 

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
by some railways as IP CCTV systems can be 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
complex to configure.

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
IP CCTV solutions, while complicated, do offer 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
more facilities and can be integrated seamlessly 

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
with other control systems to deliver integrated 

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
centralised control and monitoring. Data from 

--- Document Chunk 1511 ---
other security devices and from business systems 

--- Document Chunk 1512 ---
can be linked with IP CCTV images and recordings 

--- Document Chunk 1513 ---
while cameras can be easily controlled and 

--- Document Chunk 1514 ---
monitored from web browsers. 

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
CCTV systems regularly need to be checked 

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
to meet changing operational requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
and equipment obsolescence so the ability 

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
to easily incorporate hardware and software 

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
updates should be considered. Using existing

CCTV infrastructure such as cameras, housings 

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
and cable runs may reduce costs, but CCTV 

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
equipment is improving all the time, as the 

--- Document Chunk 1551 ---
capabilities of CCTV components advances. 

--- Document Chunk 1552 ---
Replacing old equipment and infrastructure may 

--- Document Chunk 1553 ---
therefore improve system performance and be a 

--- Document Chunk 1554 ---
more cost-effective solution. 

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
Station Management Systems (SMS) are typically 

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---
deployed at large stations or in a group of stations 

--- Document Chunk 1557 ---
along a route managed from a central location. 

--- Document Chunk 1558 ---
The SMS is the focal point for station operations 

--- Document Chunk 1559 ---
and provides the operator with a user-friendly, 

--- Document Chunk 1560 ---
functional environment from which to monitor 

--- Document Chunk 1561 ---
and control all station systems. The SMS should 

--- Document Chunk 1562 ---
gather information from many sources and 

--- Document Chunk 1563 ---
provide control of the various individual station 

--- Document Chunk 1564 ---
systems, such as CCTV, public address, customer 

--- Document Chunk 1565 ---
information and alarm systems. Integrating the 

--- Document Chunk 1566 ---
control and operation of the CCTV system in a 

--- Document Chunk 1567 ---
clear, consistent and integrated format will help to 

--- Document Chunk 1568 ---
provide efficient and cost effective management 

--- Document Chunk 1569 ---
of the station. The SMS will usually be interfaced 

--- Document Chunk 1570 ---
with a fire alarm system so that in the event of an 

--- Document Chunk 1571 ---
alarm activation, cameras covering the area will 

--- Document Chunk 1572 ---
automatically be displayed to the operator. 

--- Document Chunk 1573 ---
A CCTV system is built up from a number of 

--- Document Chunk 1574 ---
different components.

--- Document Chunk 1575 ---
Cameras

--- Document Chunk 1576 ---
CCTV cameras are either fixed or pan-tilt-zoom 

--- Document Chunk 1577 ---
(PTZ). Fixed cameras are intended to constantly 

--- Document Chunk 1578 ---
view a single scene, while PTZ cameras are motor 

--- Document Chunk 1579 ---
driven and can pan left or right, tilt up or down, 

--- Document Chunk 1580 ---
and zoom in or out to instantly customise the 

--- Document Chunk 1581 ---
view as needed. Most systems nowadays use fixed 

--- Document Chunk 1582 ---
cameras to view and record complete areas as 

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
PTZ cameras require full time operators.

An Ingress Protection (also known as IP and not 

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
to be confused with Internet Protocol) rating 

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
is to protect equipment from attack from solid 

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
foreign objects e.g. stone throwing, and from 

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
harmful effects due to the ingress of water. Ingress 

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
Protection IP always has a number. So cameras 

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
should typically have an IP rating of IP34 when 

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
used internally and IP65 for external cameras. The 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
“IK” rating or code is an international standard 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
to define the level of resistance of enclosures to 

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
mechanical impacts. Cameras are recommended 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
to have an IK vandalism rating of IK10, along with 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
a typical operating temperature range of -15C 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
to 45C external to the housing. This may need 

--- Document Chunk 1598 ---
to be revised depending on local conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 1599 ---
The minimum resolution of cameras in a railway 

--- Document Chunk 1600 ---
system is typically 720 pixels, and systems with 

--- Document Chunk 1601 ---
1080p resolution or higher are often provided.

--- Document Chunk 1623 ---
Despite increasing use of IP network cameras, 

--- Document Chunk 1624 ---
analogue cameras still exist in many older systems 

--- Document Chunk 1625 ---
since there may be a high cost involved in 

--- Document Chunk 1626 ---
upgrading and converting to a new transmission 

--- Document Chunk 1627 ---
network. Analogue cameras can also transmit 

--- Document Chunk 1628 ---
high definition pictures, making them appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1629 ---
for various surveillance needs. These cameras 

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
also have cyber security advantages because 

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
the cable connections require a physical access 

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
for them to be breached or damaged. They are 

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
easier to configure, but will not provide as many 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
features as IP systems.

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
Power over Ethernet (PoE) IP cameras will not 

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
generally require a local power supply but must 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
be able to operate in the railway environment. PoE 

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
extenders will need to provide sufficient power 

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
to meet the camera’s operational requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
Connections to individual cameras can be via 

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
wireless such as Wi-Fi, but a local power supply 

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
will be required and the wireless connections 

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
should be encrypted for security. Possible 

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
interference with other Wi-Fi channels in the area 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
should be assessed. 

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
Day/night cameras and low-light or night vision 

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
cameras can be used to capture images in dark 

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
environments. Low-light cameras are designed to 

--- Document Chunk 1649 ---
perform in some level of ambient lighting, such as 

--- Document Chunk 1650 ---
indoor conditions, station lighting, or a full moon 

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
but are not intended for use in complete darkness. 

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
Night vision cameras used in CCTV systems 

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
typically consist of near-infrared (NIR) and infrared 

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
(IR) cameras with built-in IR illuminators and are 

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
designed to allow the viewing of night scenes. 

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
The IR light emitted can be at wavelengths that 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
are invisible to the human eye. Some operational 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
environments may require a thermal imaging 

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
camera to detect situations even if conditions 

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
such as fog or smoke are encountered. These 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
detect infrared or heat radiation that is invisible to 

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
the human eye. 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
The most complex CCTV systems may 

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
incorporate hundreds of cameras and sensors 

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
integrated into one overall security network. 

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
With larger quantities of data being collected, it is 

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
essential that the system be capable of retaining 

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
data in accordance with a company’s policies 

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
and procedures, together with data protection 

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---
and CCTV legislation. EMC requirements will 

--- Document Chunk 1671 ---
need to be considered, such as defined in 

--- Document Chunk 1672 ---
standard EN 50121-4.

--- Document Chunk 1673 ---
Camera lenses

--- Document Chunk 1674 ---
A lens has components and characteristics that 

--- Document Chunk 1675 ---
determine its capabilities. These include the 

--- Document Chunk 1676 ---
focal length, type of aperture and focus control. 

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
The focal length and size of the image sensor 

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
determine the angle from which the lens accepts 

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
light to focus on the image sensor. Any lens with 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
a focal length greater than the standard lens is a 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
telephoto lens, while a lens with a focal length less 

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
than the standard lens is a wide-angle lens. 

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---
Camera lenses shall normally be fitted with either 

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
an auto-iris fixed lens, vari-focal lens or zoom 

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
lens. Remote vari-focus, zoom, controlled back 

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
focus and remote camera alignment will all 

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
contribute to efficient operation and maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
of the system, and will eliminate the need for 

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
working at height to adjust the camera.

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
Cameras mounted on extendable or hinged posts 

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
will facilitate easy maintenance and minimise 

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
working at height during both installation and 

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
maintenance, but no hinged or extendable 

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
post should come close to any electric traction 

--- Document Chunk 1695 ---
system or other hazards. Fixed camera mounts 

--- Document Chunk 1696 ---
with adjustable horizontal and vertical planes 

--- Document Chunk 1697 ---
will maximise operational effectiveness. Camera 

--- Document Chunk 1698 ---
positions should be selected to enable routine 

--- Document Chunk 1699 ---
access (for cleaning and replacement) without the 

--- Document Chunk 1700 ---
need for blocking train movements or isolating 

--- Document Chunk 1701 ---
overhead power. Individual and isolated columns 

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
supporting lighting or cameras should be 

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
positioned to avoid creating obstructions to the 

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
movement of station users. The camera assembly, 

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
housing and sunshield should take account of 

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
the effects of sunlight during the course of the 

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
day and also the seasons of the year in order to 

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
maintain the viewing requirements of the system.

--- Document Chunk 1734 ---

such as the General Data Protection Regulation 

--- Document Chunk 1736 ---
(GDPR) and the UK Data Protection Act 1998.

--- Document Chunk 1737 ---
CCTV workstation and monitors

--- Document Chunk 1738 ---
To provide good picture quality, the minimum 

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
monitor resolution should be at least that of 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
the cameras. Multiple camera images at original 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
resolution may be required for viewing onto 

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
a high-resolution screen, so for example, a 

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
30” 4K resolution monitor could display 4 x 

--- Document Chunk 1744 ---
15” 1080p resolution cameras. The camera 

--- Document Chunk 1745 ---
identification should be easily available so the 

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
operator knows where they are looking.

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
A bank of monitors to create a ‘video wall’ 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
is commonplace in larger control centres. 

--- Document Chunk 1749 ---
These can be programmed to periodically 

--- Document Chunk 1750 ---
change the picture displayed on the monitors 

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
to help relieve the boredom from seeing the 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
same scene all the time and to concentrate 

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
the multitude of camera images on to a 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
sensible number of screens. A typical railway 

--- Document Chunk 1755 ---
CCTV control room could have 500 cameras 

--- Document Chunk 1756 ---
covering a route with about 50 monitors in 

--- Document Chunk 1757 ---
the video wall.

--- Document Chunk 1758 ---
An ergonomic assessment of the operator’s 

--- Document Chunk 1759 ---
workstation location should be undertaken 

--- Document Chunk 1760 ---
to determine the most appropriate size and 

--- Document Chunk 1761 ---
position. Providing the control systems for 

--- Document Chunk 1762 ---
camera selection and PTZ operation with 

--- Document Chunk 1763 ---
industry standard telemetry protocols with 

--- Document Chunk 1764 ---
an open architecture, will help with the 

--- Document Chunk 1765 ---
whole life support of the CCTV system and 

--- Document Chunk 1766 ---
interoperability with other systems.

--- Document Chunk 1767 ---
An agreed format for event reporting and 

--- Document Chunk 1768 ---
alarms will be required and telemetry data from 

--- Document Chunk 1769 ---
all camera input channels with time/date and 

--- Document Chunk 1770 ---
camera description will provide a consistent 

--- Document Chunk 1771 ---
format to identify station, camera location and 

--- Document Chunk 1772 ---
camera number. This will assist the operation 

--- Document Chunk 1773 ---
and management of the system, especially if 

--- Document Chunk 1774 ---
the information is consistent with details in the 

--- Document Chunk 1775 ---
asset register.

--- Document Chunk 1776 ---
Monitors may be required for public behaviour 

--- Document Chunk 1777 ---
and surveillance monitoring, for example at ticket 

--- Document Chunk 1778 ---
gate lines, so higher performance specifications 

--- Document Chunk 1779 ---
should be considered to enhance visibility 

--- Document Chunk 1780 ---
of the display. Public surveillance monitors 

--- Document Chunk 1781 ---
may require additional vandalism and ingress 

--- Document Chunk 1782 ---
protection suitable for the location in which the 

--- Document Chunk 1783 ---
monitor is being installed, such as a minimum 

--- Document Chunk 1784 ---
IP65 for all external monitors and IP32 for all 

--- Document Chunk 1785 ---
internal monitors.

ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) 

--- Document Chunk 1788 ---
is an open industry forum for the interface of 

--- Document Chunk 1789 ---
physical IP-based security products. The ONVIF 

--- Document Chunk 1790 ---
specification covers how IP products within video 

--- Document Chunk 1791 ---
surveillance and other physical security areas 

--- Document Chunk 1792 ---
can communicate with each other. Therefore, 

--- Document Chunk 1793 ---
procuring CCTV systems in compliance with the 

--- Document Chunk 1794 ---
ONVIF specification will assist interoperability 

--- Document Chunk 1795 ---
between network video products from different 

--- Document Chunk 1796 ---
suppliers. ONVIF aims to provide standardisation 

--- Document Chunk 1797 ---
of communication between IP-based physical 

--- Document Chunk 1798 ---
security products to give interoperability 

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
regardless of the brand, and is open to all 

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
companies and organisations. Using ONVIF 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
equipment will help with not becoming locked 

--- Document Chunk 1802 ---
in to any particular proprietary technical solution 

--- Document Chunk 1803 ---
devised by individual manufacturers.

--- Document Chunk 1804 ---
System security is important so access to the 

--- Document Chunk 1805 ---
system and any recorded images should be strictly 

--- Document Chunk 1806 ---
controlled to prevent tampering or unauthorised 

--- Document Chunk 1807 ---
viewing. This could be via electronic access 

--- Document Chunk 1808 ---
controls, including but not limited to passwords 

--- Document Chunk 1809 ---
or encryption, to prevent unauthorised access 

--- Document Chunk 1810 ---
to the building, system and recordings, with an 

--- Document Chunk 1811 ---
audit trail and record of who accessed the system 

--- Document Chunk 1812 ---
and when. Different levels of user privileges, 

--- Document Chunk 1813 ---
such as Administrator, User and Maintainer, 

--- Document Chunk 1814 ---
may be appropriate. Further information can 

--- Document Chunk 1815 ---
be found in BSI document ‘Code of Practice

--- Document Chunk 1842 ---
External remote access will also need security 

--- Document Chunk 1843 ---
via firewalls and compliance with individual 

--- Document Chunk 1844 ---
company’s security policies. The system should 

--- Document Chunk 1845 ---
prevent transmitted images from being corrupted 

--- Document Chunk 1846 ---
or modified in transit. Where the proposed system 

--- Document Chunk 1847 ---
does not provide the specified security functions, 

--- Document Chunk 1848 ---
the network or transmission medium used could 

--- Document Chunk 1849 ---
be employed to provide equivalent security.

--- Document Chunk 1850 ---
Video analytics such as the detection of unusual 

--- Document Chunk 1851 ---
movement in a normally static picture may be 

--- Document Chunk 1852 ---
specified in the design, as these can further 

--- Document Chunk 1853 ---
improve the overall effectiveness of the CCTV 

--- Document Chunk 1854 ---
security solution. Video analytics monitor the 

--- Document Chunk 1855 ---
video streams in near real-time and automatically 

--- Document Chunk 1856 ---
create security alerts when recognising specific 

--- Document Chunk 1857 ---
types of events and activities. Video analytics 

--- Document Chunk 1858 ---
can also be used for analysing historical data 

--- Document Chunk 1859 ---
to identify specific incidents and patterns 

--- Document Chunk 1860 ---
(forensic analysis).

--- Document Chunk 1861 ---
Using a video analytics system to automatically 

--- Document Chunk 1862 ---
monitor camera video feeds and providing alerts 

--- Document Chunk 1863 ---
for events of interest enables efficiency and cost 

--- Document Chunk 1864 ---
reductions by reducing the need for human 

--- Document Chunk 1865 ---
concentration and helps operators to notice and 

--- Document Chunk 1866 ---
respond to threats sooner. Typical uses are for 

--- Document Chunk 1867 ---
perimeter protection intrusion management, 

--- Document Chunk 1868 ---
crowd management and situation awareness. 

--- Document Chunk 1869 ---
They can also be used for ‘footfall’ counting to 

--- Document Chunk 1870 ---
assist the commercialisation of retail space on 

--- Document Chunk 1871 ---
stations and passenger loading on trains.

--- Document Chunk 1872 ---
On initial installation, consideration should be 

--- Document Chunk 1873 ---
given to fit spare switching, optical and Cat 5E/6 

--- Document Chunk 1874 ---
copper cable (where appropriate) for at least an 

--- Document Chunk 1875 ---
additional 10 per cent spare capacity in agreement 

--- Document Chunk 1876 ---
with stakeholders’ policy. This will allow expansion 

--- Document Chunk 1877 ---
for future requirements.

--- Document Chunk 1878 ---
Video storage

--- Document Chunk 1879 ---
The system will need to store recordings for all 

--- Document Chunk 1880 ---
connected cameras for a time period of typically 

--- Document Chunk 1881 ---
31 days so as to assist with any post incident 

--- Document Chunk 1882 ---
investigations. All video data once past the stated 

--- Document Chunk 1883 ---
time period should be automatically deleted 

--- Document Chunk 1884 ---
unless marked for retention. A facility for local 

--- Document Chunk 1885 ---
or remote users to mark specific pictures or 

--- Document Chunk 1886 ---
sequences identified as relevant to an investigation 

--- Document Chunk 1887 ---
for retention should be considered. To optimise 

--- Document Chunk 1888 ---
storage capacity, agreement from stakeholders 

--- Document Chunk 1889 ---
should be obtained as to the circumstances in 

--- Document Chunk 1890 ---
which images will be recorded for review and 

--- Document Chunk 1891 ---
at what resolution, together with date and time 

--- Document Chunk 1892 ---
stamping requirements. Care may need to be 

--- Document Chunk 1893 ---
taken that any video compression does not 

--- Document Chunk 1894 ---
compromise video quality.

--- Document Chunk 1895 ---
Clocks

--- Document Chunk 1896 ---
Accurate clocks are important for a smooth-

--- Document Chunk 1897 ---
running railway, and telecoms engineers in 

--- Document Chunk 1898 ---
many railway companies have provided clock 

--- Document Chunk 1899 ---
systems for many years. Originally they were 

--- Document Chunk 1900 ---
provided using centrally located ‘master clocks’ 

--- Document Chunk 1901 ---
communicating with slave clocks via telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 1902 ---
cables. More recently clocks are Global Navigation 

--- Document Chunk 1903 ---
Satellite System (GNSS) controlled, so just need 

--- Document Chunk 1904 ---
a power supply and possibly an external antenna 

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
to receive the satellite signal. The positioning 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
of clocks needs to take into account similar 

--- Document Chunk 1907 ---
criteria to PA, CIS and CCTV systems with regards 

--- Document Chunk 1908 ---
to height, maintenance and not obstructing 

--- Document Chunk 1909 ---
signal sighting.   

--- Document Chunk 1910 ---
Internet connection for trains

--- Document Chunk 1911 ---
Most train passengers now have an expectation 

--- Document Chunk 1912 ---
that a connection to the internet will be available 

--- Document Chunk 1913 ---
on trains. With an on-board internet connection, 

--- Document Chunk 1914 ---
real time ticket sales via debit/credit card are 

--- Document Chunk 1915 ---
possible, along with seat occupancy reporting 

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---

and preventative maintenance are also key to 

--- Document Chunk 1943 ---
enhancing operational efficiency. This could 

--- Document Chunk 1944 ---
include data to monitor and manage the train, 

--- Document Chunk 1945 ---
and if adequate bandwidth is available real time 

--- Document Chunk 1946 ---
forward and rear facing CCTV cameras for track 

--- Document Chunk 1947 ---
and signalling maintenance. While GSM-R will 

--- Document Chunk 1948 ---
provide the wireless connection for ERTMS /

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
CBTC movement authority, it does not have 

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
sufficient capacity for train Wi-Fi applications 

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---
and use of public 4G or 5G LTE networks is more 

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
usual for provision of the internet connection. 

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
The replacement for GSM-R, known as FRMCS 

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
(Future Radio Mobile Communication System), 

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
is planned to provide for all train connectivity 

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
requirements, including business and passenger 

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
communications.

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
To improve or provide an internet connection on 

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
trains it is likely to require equipment both on the 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
infrastructure and train. Like many applications, 

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
such as operational voice and ETCS/CBTC, this 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
will require close working between rolling stock 

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
and S&T engineers, and for each to have an 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
appreciation of the engineering principles for both 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
infrastructure and trains. 

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
By their construction, train vehicles create 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
attenuation which degrades the usable signal 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
in the train. The degree of attenuation varies 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
between 5 to 35dB depending on the rail vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
profile and a loss of 3dB results in halving the 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
available power. The on-train user experience 

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---
can vary as a result of the differing levels of signal 

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
attenuation due to a significant mix of different 

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
devices, with an increasing trend towards the use 

--- Document Chunk 1975 ---
of multiband smartphones and tablets. Multiband 

--- Document Chunk 1976 ---
devices incorporate wider band receivers which 

--- Document Chunk 1977 ---
weaken the performance for any one single band, 

--- Document Chunk 1978 ---
and coupled with multiband antennas becoming 

--- Document Chunk 1979 ---
integrated into the handsets themselves makes 

--- Document Chunk 1980 ---
reception on-board trains even more challenging. 

--- Document Chunk 1981 ---
There is a significant cost involved in the 

--- Document Chunk 1982 ---
design and implementation of additional public 

--- Document Chunk 1983 ---
operator radio sites along rail routes and careful 

--- Document Chunk 1984 ---
consideration is required for any additional public 

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
radio coverage to avoid signal interference with 

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
GSM-R and FRMCS.

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
Internet connectivity can be improved by 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
providing digital on-board repeaters (D-OBR). A 

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
D-OBR is an active multi-band, multi-operator 

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
repeater which is designed to provide coverage 

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
within train vehicles by amplifying and re-radiating 

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
(repeating) the external 2G, 3G and 4G/LTE mobile 

--- Document Chunk 1993 ---
operator signals through dedicated ceiling-

--- Document Chunk 1994 ---
mounted antennas. A D-OBR will provide Internet 

--- Document Chunk 1995 ---
access to mobile phones without a Wi-Fi facility; 

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
however, most passengers now expect Wi-Fi 

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
to be available, although some train operators 

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
have ‘quiet coaches’ to restrict nuisance use by 

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---
some travellers who can adversely impact the 

--- Document Chunk 2000 ---
journey experience. 

--- Document Chunk 2001 ---
One or more external mounted wideband 

--- Document Chunk 2002 ---
antennas can be provided on trains and 

--- Document Chunk 2003 ---
connected to a communications device known 

--- Document Chunk 2004 ---
as a Mobile Communications Gateway (MCG). 

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
A wideband antenna capable of receiving a 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
wide range of Mobile Network Operator (MNO) 

--- Document Chunk 2007 ---
services and 2.5GHz or 5GHz point to point Wi-Fi 

--- Document Chunk 2008 ---
connections at stations can be provided, with 

--- Document Chunk 2009 ---
6GHz Wi-Fi systems also being introduced. Care 

--- Document Chunk 2010 ---
will be needed on the location of the wideband 

--- Document Chunk 2011 ---
train antennae so they do not interfere with the 

--- Document Chunk 2012 ---
train GSM-R antenna.

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
Antennae are one of the most critical items to 

--- Document Chunk 2014 ---
deliver good connectivity on and off the train, 

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
and creating an efficient antenna solution will 

--- Document Chunk 2016 ---
do much to improve system efficiency. Many of 

--- Document Chunk 2017 ---
the radio frequency problems associated with 

--- Document Chunk 2018 ---
antennae also stem from poor fitment of feeder 

--- Document Chunk 2019 ---
cables, which should be installed in accordance 

--- Document Chunk 2020 ---
with the manufacturer’s instructions.

--- Document Chunk 2021 ---
The MCG (or number of MCGs) provides ‘a 

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
cloud’ of connectivity to the train via a number 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
of MNO services and external Wi-Fi connections 

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
aggregated together. Fixed Wi-Fi at stations 

--- Document Chunk 2025 ---
or trackside is a good way of enhancing the 

--- Document Chunk 2026 ---
connectivity as this is within the control of the rail 

--- Document Chunk 2027 ---
industry. At terminal stations it can provide a good 

--- Document Chunk 2028 ---
link to a train and this is where many people open 

--- Document Chunk 2029 ---
their device and ‘log on’. Wi-Fi systems are ‘licence 

--- Document Chunk 2030 ---
free’ so care may need to be taken to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 2031 ---
interference from other Wi-Fi systems, which 

--- Document Chunk 2032 ---
could be located away from the railway. 

--- Document Chunk 2033 ---
Most train passengers 

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---
now have an expectation 

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
that a connection to the 

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
internet will be available 

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
on trains.

Paul Darlington CEng, FIET, FIRSE, joined the S&T department 

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
of the London Midland Region of British Rail in 1975 as a 

--- Document Chunk 2049 ---
trainee telecoms technician. After maintaining telephone 

--- Document Chunk 2050 ---
exchanges, he became an instructor at the regional S&T 

--- Document Chunk 2051 ---
training centre. In the 1980s he moved to the telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 2052 ---
project office in Birmingham and was involved in designing 

--- Document Chunk 2053 ---
and implementing CIS, CCTV, SPT and radio systems.  

--- Document Chunk 2054 ---
Moving to Railtrack in 1994 Paul led the asset management 

--- Document Chunk 2055 ---
of telecoms for the north west of England and became 

--- Document Chunk 2056 ---
engineering manager for all disciplines. In 2008 he moved 

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---
to London as head of telecoms engineering for Network 

--- Document Chunk 2058 ---
Rail and finished his full-time career as route asset manager 

--- Document Chunk 2059 ---
signalling in Manchester. Paul also led the work to enhance 

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
the Network Rail network with IP, which led to the creation 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
of Network Rail Telecoms (NRT) and the Network Rail FTNx 

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
IP network. He also chaired the safety approval panel for 

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---
the GSM-R Network.

--- Document Chunk 2064 ---
Retiring in 2012, today Paul is an engineering writer, managing 

--- Document Chunk 2065 ---
editor for IRSE News and also interviews applicants for 

--- Document Chunk 2066 ---
professional registration with the IET and IRSE.

Trevor Foulkes MA, CEng, FIRSE joined British Rail in 1979 as 

--- Document Chunk 2068 ---
a sponsored management trainee engineer. After graduating 

--- Document Chunk 2069 ---
from Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge his training was based 

--- Document Chunk 2070 ---
in the S&T department of the Western Region, followed 

--- Document Chunk 2071 ---
by a series of roles in the design of systems and the 

--- Document Chunk 2072 ---
management of technicians and engineers.

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
In 1994 Trevor joined Railtrack and specified telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
works for the south and west of the country after which 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
he joined HQ and set national standards for equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
He then joined the West Coast Main Line (WCML) 

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
resignalling team in 1996.

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
In 2000, he led the business case development for the 

--- Document Chunk 2079 ---
telecoms network, now known as the Fixed Telecom 

--- Document Chunk 2080 ---
Network (FTN), before becoming the design authority for 

--- Document Chunk 2081 ---
the FTN and GSM-R systems. In 2012, he was seconded to 

--- Document Chunk 2082 ---
the High Speed 2 project to develop the control, command 

--- Document Chunk 2083 ---
& signal engineering design. He also led the Spectrum 

--- Document Chunk 2084 ---
Group of the UIC project developing the next generation of 

--- Document Chunk 2085 ---
operational radio to replace GSM-R.

--- Document Chunk 2086 ---
Trevor retired in 2015 and is chair of the London & 

--- Document Chunk 2087 ---
South-East Section of the IRSE and has assisted with the 

--- Document Chunk 2088 ---
telecoms aspects of the new Certificate in Railway Control 

--- Document Chunk 2089 ---
Engineering Fundamentals (module A).

About the authors ...

--- Document Chunk 2091 ---
The connectivity to the MCG may also include satellite 

--- Document Chunk 2092 ---
connections, although some systems can be troubled by higher 

--- Document Chunk 2093 ---
latency times to and from a moving train. A train compares 

--- Document Chunk 2094 ---
unfavourably with a more stable platform like an aircraft, 

--- Document Chunk 2095 ---
which is how an internet connection is provided in the air 

--- Document Chunk 2096 ---
industry. Satellite communications will not work in tunnels or 

--- Document Chunk 2097 ---
deep cuttings. 

--- Document Chunk 2098 ---
An acceptable customer service in order to support email and 

--- Document Chunk 2099 ---
social media browsing can be provided with a data bandwidth 

--- Document Chunk 2100 ---
as low as a few hundred kbits/s, but obviously the more 

--- Document Chunk 2101 ---
bandwidth the better. Limiting each customer to a maximum 

--- Document Chunk 2102 ---
will help to provide an acceptable service to all customers 

--- Document Chunk 2103 ---
on the train. In order to provide a reliable non-discriminatory 

--- Document Chunk 2104 ---
service, certain high bandwidth applications, such as video and 

--- Document Chunk 2105 ---
audio streaming services or peer-to-peer file sharing, may need 

--- Document Chunk 2106 ---
filtering and restricting. On train bandwidth requirements will 

--- Document Chunk 2107 ---
vary depending on the number of active Wi-Fi customers and 

--- Document Chunk 2108 ---
may increase as passengers become aware of Wi-Fi availability, 

--- Document Chunk 2109 ---
therefore additional bandwidth should always be planned for.

--- Document Chunk 2110 ---
Final thoughts

--- Document Chunk 2111 ---
So, given all that has been covered in both parts of the back 

--- Document Chunk 2112 ---
to basics of railway telecoms, what makes railway telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 2113 ---
different from providing a public telecoms network?

--- Document Chunk 2114 ---
Many pieces of equipment can be used for railway and public 

--- Document Chunk 2115 ---
telecommunications e.g. cables, transmission and exchange 

--- Document Chunk 2116 ---
equipment. There are pieces of equipment which are specific 

--- Document Chunk 2117 ---
to the railway such as signalling centre concentrators and 

--- Document Chunk 2118 ---
GSM-R cab radios. These items are normally developed to 

--- Document Chunk 2119 ---
provide a feature which is unique to the railway – e.g. using the 

--- Document Chunk 2120 ---
GSM-R frequency bands or needing to be designed to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 2121 ---
an activity which may cause risk, such as two drivers speaking 

--- Document Chunk 2122 ---
to a signaller at the same time. The equipment also has to 

--- Document Chunk 2123 ---
operate correctly in the railway environment which is normally 

--- Document Chunk 2124 ---
harsher than an office environment. Factors to take into 

--- Document Chunk 2125 ---
account include Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), vibration, 

--- Document Chunk 2126 ---
temperature, and humidity.

--- Document Chunk 2127 ---
Railway telecoms is managed in a different way to a public 

--- Document Chunk 2128 ---
telephone network. An example would be that railway operators 

--- Document Chunk 2129 ---
expect any engineering or station works that will disrupt the 

--- Document Chunk 2130 ---
train service, to be pre-planned, agreed with them and to be 

--- Document Chunk 2131 ---
told when a facility is restored. Similarly, if a significant fault 

--- Document Chunk 2132 ---
occurs it has to be investigated to ascertain the root cause so 

--- Document Chunk 2133 ---
that, if necessary, steps can be taken to prevent recurrence. 

--- Document Chunk 2134 ---
Such situations demand telecommunication requirements that 

--- Document Chunk 2135 ---
may be difficult to obtain from the service provided by a public 

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
telecom operator.

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
A railway telecom engineer is expected to understand the rules 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
and procedures employed on the railway so that when they are 

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
designing systems to support the operation, they can define 

--- Document Chunk 2140 ---
what functionality is required and also understand the safety 

--- Document Chunk 2141 ---
and performance implications of any failures. So if an off the 

--- Document Chunk 2142 ---
shelf piece of equipment is used, the engineer needs to be sure 

--- Document Chunk 2143 ---
that it is fit for the purpose intended, for example, it provides 

--- Document Chunk 2144 ---
sufficient protection to be used in places of high induced 

--- Document Chunk 2145 ---
voltages or vibration.

--- Document Chunk 2146 ---
If it is decided to use a public telephone system (fixed or 

--- Document Chunk 2147 ---
mobile) to support a railway application, then the possible 

--- Document Chunk 2148 ---
shortcomings of using the standard facilities should be 

--- Document Chunk 2149 ---
considered. For instance, the radio coverage may change over 

--- Document Chunk 2150 ---
time and not cover areas of the track. A public operator may not 

--- Document Chunk 2151 ---
be able to provide diversity between two circuits for the last few 

--- Document Chunk 2152 ---
miles at a reasonable cost. The public service may be turned 

--- Document Chunk 2153 ---
off for maintenance overnight and at short notice. If these 

--- Document Chunk 2154 ---
shortcomings are acceptable then the use of public services 

--- Document Chunk 2155 ---
can provide a cost-effective solution for some railways.

--- Document Chunk 2156 ---
There may be a temptation for some governments and railway 

--- Document Chunk 2157 ---
authorities to ‘sell off’ the railway telecoms assets and resource 

--- Document Chunk 2158 ---
to raise finance or for commercial purposes. This has occurred 

--- Document Chunk 2159 ---
several times across the world. However, in nearly every 

--- Document Chunk 2160 ---
example, the railway authority has had to buy back or re-install 

--- Document Chunk 2161 ---
its own telecoms infrastructure, plus rebuilding a telecoms 

--- Document Chunk 2162 ---
workforce. Telecoms is a vital part of railways operations and 

--- Document Chunk 2163 ---
with the increasing use of digital signalling systems and the 

--- Document Chunk 2164 ---
internet of things, it is becoming ever more important.
