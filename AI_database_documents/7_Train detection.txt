Train detection – the basics

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
This, second of a series of articles on ‘back 

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
to basics’ themes, looks at the essentials 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
of train detection (or more accurately, as 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
we shall see, train absence detection). One 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
of the main safety requirements of a train 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
control systems is the need to know it is safe 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
to establish a route and provide movement 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
authority for a train. In particular, before 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
points or other moveable infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
has its position changed or a train is given 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
permission to proceed, the relevant part 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
of the line has to be proved to be clear of 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
other trains. Thus, the ability to detect the 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
presence of a train on a particular stretch of 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
track is a key requirement for modern train 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
control. The principles of train detection will 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
be very familiar to experienced signalling 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
engineers, and so this article is intended for 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
members new to the industry.

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
There are currently two main types of train 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
detection system, namely the track circuit and 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
the axle counter. Both of them use track-based 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
technology, and although other track-based 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
solutions have been trialled over the years 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
(including mass detectors, infrared and optical 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
detectors), none of these have been widely 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
adopted. We will look at both track circuits and 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
axle counters in some detail in this article.

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
An alternative approach is to use train-based 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
technology, whereby the train determines its 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
location and communicates this information to 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
the interlocking and control centre on a regular 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
basis using a reliable secure communication link. 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
Various technical options exist, including:

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
• Satellite positioning (Global Navigation Satellite 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
Systems – GNSS).

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
• Odometry (counting wheel revolutions).

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
• Video (by recognition of 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
infrastructure features).

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
• Proprietary systems offered, in particular, 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
by Communication-Based Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
(CBTC) suppliers. 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
These solutions are sometimes used in 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
combination to achieve the required degree 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
of positional accuracy, and they may also be 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
supplemented by equipment such as track-based 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
balises or RFID (radio frequency identification) tags 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
to periodically correct incremental positioning 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
errors. Train-borne positioning systems are a 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
standard feature of modern CBTC systems (which 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
often use moving block technology) and will be 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
for ERTMS Level 3 as well. We will explore this 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
subject further later in this article. 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
All train-borne positioning systems rely upon 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
some form of train to track communication 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
system so that the interlocking is regularly 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
provided with up-to-date information about 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
the train location. This may be a radio system, 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
or a short-range communication system such 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
as inductive loops in the track, Wi-Fi, or leaky 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
feeder technology. 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
Despite the growth of train-based technologies, 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
for the majority of railways around the world that 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
use train detection systems, the track circuit and 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
the axle counter continue to be the favoured 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
solutions. There are, of course, also many railways 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
which use little or no train detection technology 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
and rely instead on ‘absolute block’ methods of 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
working or ‘train orders’ (verbal communication 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
between the control centre and the train drivers).

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
Track circuits

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
The track circuit was originally used simply to 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
remind signallers that a train was present on a 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
particular section of track, not as an integral part 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
of the locking of points and signals. It was the 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
development of the track circuit that enabled the 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
full potential of ‘space interval’ signalling based 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
on track circuit block principles (continuous train 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
detection between signal boxes). It also enabled 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
signals to be provided that worked automatically 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
with the passage of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
The track circuit continuously proves the absence 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
of a train from a given section of track in a fail- 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
safe manner. It cannot prove the presence of a 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
“There are two 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
main types of 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
technology 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
generally 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
used for train 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
detection”

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
train, since almost any failure mode will give the 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
same indication as if a train is present. By positively 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
proving the absence of a train, a track circuit can 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
be used to confirm that it is safe to set a route and 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
permit a train to proceed. The track circuit should 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
not be confused with a ‘rail circuit’, which is used 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
for non-fail-safe applications to positively prove 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
the presence of a train. 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
Fundamental design principles of 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
track circuits

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
The most basic track circuit consists of a source 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
of electrical energy (a direct current – DC), fed 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
through an impedance and along the rails to a 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
boundary which is defined by a pair of Insulated 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
Rail Joints (IRJs are provided at both ends of the 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
track circuit to define the detection limits of the 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
track circuit). At the boundary a detection device, 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
typically a relay, is connected across the rails and 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
is energised by the direct current provided there is 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
no train present (see Figure 1). 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
Thus, the track circuit confirms the absence of a 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
train to the signalling system (track circuit clear). 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
The presence of metal wheels and axles of a train 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
within the track circuit boundaries will cause the 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
rails to be ‘short circuited.’ The increased current 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
flow results in a greater volt drop through the feed 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
impedance which, together with the shunting 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
effect of the short circuit, means the detector no 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
longer sees sufficient electrical energy to remain 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
energised, and so it changes to the ‘de-energised’ 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
state. This state change informs the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
system that the track is ‘occupied’. 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
Any electrical short-circuit between the rails, 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
whether caused by a train or not, or any 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
disconnection within the circuit (for example a 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
cable being cut or falling off the rail), or a loss 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
of supply current, will cause the track circuit to 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
inform the signalling system it is occupied. This 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
means that virtually any equipment fault will cause 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
the system to ‘fail safe’ and thereby maintain 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
signals at red. Although safe, this behaviour can 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
result in unreliability, especially if the track circuit is 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
not set up or maintained correctly. A track circuit 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
operating device (e.g. ‘clips’) can also be used to 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
protect a train in an emergency. Correct operation 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
of a track circuit also depends upon good 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
electrical contact between a train’s wheels and the 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
rails, together with a continuous low-impedance 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
path between each wheel via the connecting axle 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
on the train. This will be discussed later.

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
DC, AC and coded track circuits

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
Simple as the track circuit may seem, there 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
are various ways of powering the system and 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
detecting the state of the track circuit (occupied or 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
clear), and all have their benefits and weaknesses. 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
The source of electrical energy may be any of 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
DC, AC at power frequencies (typically 50Hz), 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
AC at audio frequencies (a few thousand Hz),

Figure 1 – The

fundamental principles 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
of the track circuit are

simple. A train travelling

between an electrical 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
source and detector 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
shorts out the current 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
flowing between them, 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
and the loss of current 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
at the detector indicates 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
that the absence of trains 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
can no longer be assured. 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
More modern devices use 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
coded, typical shift-keyed, 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
signals to offer more 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
immunity to complex

traction systems.

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
a series of impulses or complex waveforms 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
including digital codes. Similarly, the detector may 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
be a simple relay, an AC ‘vane’ relay or a more 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
complex receiver tuned to a particular frequency 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
or pattern of signals. It should be noted that the 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
high volume of conductive metal in a rail results 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
in a high inductance and thus track circuits with 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
a high frequency component tend to be short in 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
length. Some track circuits can also act as a carrier 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
for coded signals that are passed to the train. 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
These are usually associated with ATP and early 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
ATO systems, and examples include TVM430, the 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
original ATP system used on French High-Speed 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
lines, and the original implementation of ATP with 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
ATO on the London Underground Victoria line. 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
The two rails on a railway are in practice not 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
perfectly insulated from each other. There is 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
always a leakage path between the two through 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
the rail fixings, the sleepers, the ballast and 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
the ground itself. This is known as the ballast 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
resistance. Its value is dependent upon the 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
condition of any rail insulation, the cleanliness of 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
the ballast, and the prevailing weather conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
It is inversely proportional to track circuit length. 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
High ballast resistance values are ideal for a 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
track circuit and may be obtained in dry/clean 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
conditions or during frosty weather, but wet 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
conditions may reduce the value significantly, 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
especially where there is bad drainage and/or 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
contamination from conductive materials in the 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
track-bed. So, if for instance the track is flooded, 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
the track circuit will show occupied and the signal 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
controlling the track section will remain at red. 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
Wet tunnels, sea walls and similar locations can be 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
a particular problem, as the conditions can vary 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
significantly on a frequent basis, which means that 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
the track circuits need to be repeatedly adjusted 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
to keep them working reliably and safely. 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
One difficulty with adjusting track circuits is 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
knowing the prevailing value of ballast resistance. 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
If a track circuit fails due to wet weather, it may 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
be possible to remedy the situation by reducing 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
the feed impedance. However, a too low feed 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
impedance can lead to trains not being detected 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
(a ‘wrong side failure’). This will occur when a low 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
feed impedance allows enough energy to reach 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
the detector despite a train standing on the track. 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
Some track circuits with highly variable ballast 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
conditions may need frequent, often seasonal, 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
adjustment to avoid this risk. This adjustment and 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
testing currently has to be carried out manually, 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
putting staff out on the railway and therefore 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
placing them at risk, as well as being an expensive 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
and time-consuming use of resources.

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
Rust films and contaminants

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
The resistance through the train’s wheels and axles 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
is also an important factor, as it is the train which 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
shorts out the track circuit. There are several ways 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
in which the resistance of this short circuit may 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
increase, with detrimental effect on operation. 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
One way is the presence of a rust film on the 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
rail head or wheel. The mechanical strength of 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
light rust films is much reduced by the presence 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
of moisture, when the contaminant tends to 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
be squeezed out from the wheel/rail contact 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
patch. Therefore, lightly rusted rails will only 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
be a problem when dry. Very heavy rust, from 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
prolonged disuse of the track, or after re-

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
railing with new rail, can result in track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
being incapable of detecting trains, especially 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
lightweight trains as they are not heavy enough to 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
penetrate the layer of rust. Therefore, care needs 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
to be taken after track relaying, when track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
should not be restored to full operation until a 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
good electrically conductive surface has been 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
created. One positive result from today’s crowded 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
railway on some routes is that busy lines have little 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
chance to rust, reducing the problem. However, 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
seldom-used branch lines, particularly in coastal 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
regions where rust formation is exacerbated by 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
salt, are at risk.

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
Other contaminants that increase the electrical 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
resistance between the rails and the train’s wheels 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
can cause the same problems. Those associated 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
with falling leaves are generally limited to the 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
autumn, and are usually confined to known 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
locations, which may include built-up areas. 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
Leaves are drawn into the wheel–rail interface by 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
the passage of a train where they are squashed 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
into a pulp. This contaminates both the rail 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
and wheel, causing wheel-slip problems when 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
wet, and significantly increasing the electrical 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
resistance when dry. 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
Reasonably dry weather with little wind will cause 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
the leaves to fall gradually over a longer period, 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
and they will be reasonably sap-free when they 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
do fall. But high wind conditions will lead to a 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
sudden fall of sap-laden leaves, giving rise to the 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
worst conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
In many temperate 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
climates autumn leaf fall 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
can cause contamination 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
on the rail head, and 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
unreliable shunting of 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
track circuits.

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
“Tread-braked 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
trains can 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
sometimes give 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
a better track

modern disc-

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
Problems with coal dust and other similar 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
contaminants on the rail head tend to be confined 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
to collieries and other loading/unloading areas. 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
Sand contamination can also be a problem, 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
although not so much due to seaside locations, 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
but with slow-moving locomotives using 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
excessive amounts of sand for adhesion purposes. 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
In each of these cases, the effect is similar to 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
heavy rust. Problems can also occur with ballast 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
condition issues associated with carbon-based 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
contaminants, and of course heavy rain causing 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
puddles and floods can short out the track circuits.

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
Train issues

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
Where a thin film of contaminant insulates the 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
wheel from the rail, this can often be pierced if 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
there is a rough surface on the running face of the 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
wheel. The older style of tread brakes caused the 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
wheel tyres to be cleaned and roughened at each 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
brake application, whereas more modern disc-

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
braked trains do not, and the tyres may be rolled 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
into a very smooth surface condition. Therefore 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
older tread-braked trains generally provided 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
better track circuit operation than modern 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
disc-braked trains. 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
Similarly, the axle weight has an effect, as a heavy 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
load will pierce a film more easily. Again, modern 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
lightweight trains, which are designed to minimise 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
track wear, cause more track circuit problems than 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
old-style heavy locomotive hauled trains. 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
To assist vehicles to shunt track circuits, a device 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
known as the ‘Track Circuit Assister’ (TCA) is 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
sometimes fitted to modern trains in Britain 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
to induce an electrical potential between the 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
wheelset and the rail head and thereby break 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
down any insulating film. Typically, a TCA consists 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
of a control unit and aerial with associated tuning 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
unit, mounted between a pair of wheelsets close 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
to the rails. These devices tend to be fitted to the 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
end bogies of the train because it is important, 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
especially around point work, that the extremities 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
of the train are detected so that the points cannot 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
be inadvertently moved at the wrong time.

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
Insulation

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
As has been described, any direct metallic 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
connection between the two rails will be 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
interpreted by the track circuit as a train and 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
will cause the track circuit to show occupied. 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
Therefore, apart from the insulated rail joints or 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
block joints used to electrically separate sections 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
of line, the reliable operation of track circuits also 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
requires the provision of insulators to stop other 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
track components shorting out the track circuit. 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
At a set of points, for example, there are many 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
cross-rail connections – stretcher bars, point 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
motors and heating elements – all of which 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
need to be insulated, giving rise to quite 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
complex insulating and bonding arrangements. 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
In addition, the actual running rails cross at the 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
‘frog’ or ‘heel’ of the points, requiring insulated 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
rail joints and bonding in the switch rails to 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
transfer the polarity of the circuit to the other rail. 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
Designing track circuits to work reliably and safely 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
through complex switches and crossings can be 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
quite a challenge!

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
Concrete sleepers incorporate a rubber pad under 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
the rail foot and moulded insulations where the 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
fixings bear on the top of the foot. These increase 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
ballast resistance to levels significantly higher than 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
can be obtained with timber sleepers. However, 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
the insulations can erode due to the vibration 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
of passing traffic and, consequently, require 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
inspection and periodical replacement – another 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
maintenance overhead. Steel sleepers are even 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
more of a problem. They are also insulated, of 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
course, but any degradation of that insulation will 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
result in severe problems. 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
Ultimately the maximum length of a track circuit 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
will be limited by the achievable ballast resistance, 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
its variability with prevailing environmental 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
conditions, and the level of reliability required. 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
It will also be influenced by interference from 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
electric traction, which is discussed below. In the 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
UK it would be reasonable to assume that these 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
factors limit a track circuit to a maximum of about 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
1500m, although isolated examples of longer 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
ones can be found.

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
Bonding

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
of electric traction. For a track circuit to fail 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
safe (show occupied) in the event of a bonding 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
disconnection, it is necessary to bond all elements 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
of the track circuit in series, so that any one 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
failure breaks the circuit. In practice, in switches 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
and crossings it may not be physically possible to 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
arrange series bonding of every part of every rail.

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
Later in the article we will deal with single rail 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
traction bonding (which only provides series 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
bonding for the track circuit signal rail as the 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
traction return is usually bonded in parallel 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
with other traction return paths); and ‘double 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
rail traction bonding’ (providing total series 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
bonding for a track circuit as well as both rails 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
for the traction return path). In the majority of 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
cases traction bonding through switches and 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
crossings is single rail traction where track 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
circuits are provided.

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
Insulated rail joints

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
IRJs are expensive, both to install and to maintain, 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
especially on tracks subjected to high speed, high 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
axle-weight traffic or where there is an intensive 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
service. A rail joint also presents an increased risk 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
of rail fracture, although now with factory made 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
six-hole glued joints this is less of a risk than with 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
older styles of IRJ. As mentioned above, they are 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
also required in areas of points and crossings, 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
which makes the railway less physically robust 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
than track engineers would wish. 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
It is also possible for the insulation in the IRJ to be 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
compromised, either by failure or by burring of the 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
top of the rail such that it bridges the insulating 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
element. This could cause a wrong side failure 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
because one track circuit supplies power to the 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
detection element of the next track circuit, across 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
the failed IRJ. For this reason, most simple DC and 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
low frequency AC track circuits connect to the 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
rails with opposite polarities either side of the IRJ 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
to ensure that, should the insulation fail, both track 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
circuits will show occupied. 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
One solution for avoiding IRJs is the use of 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
audio frequency AC track circuits which permit 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
the physical limits of an individual track circuit 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
to be defined by ‘tuned’ zone, rather than by 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
insulators in the rails. Adjacent and parallel track 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
circuits operate at different audio frequencies 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
and each one is designed to detect its own track 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
frequency but no other. It is possible, with careful 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
design, to arrange a short overlap in the centre 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
of the tuned zone where both track circuits are 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
effectively shunted. 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
The use of audio frequency track circuits is not 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
always a practicable solution for complex switch 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
and crossing layouts, not least because of the 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
complication of significant rail impedances 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
associated with parallel bonding. 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
Broken rails

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
By their very nature of operation track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
are sometimes regarded as a means of detecting 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
broken rails. However, track circuits will only 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
detect a broken rail that is fractured all the way 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
through and is not bridged by any form of bonding 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
or other electrical connection. So, a damaged 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
rail head or foot will not be detected but could 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
be equally problematic. On an electrified railway 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
the need to maintain a traction current return 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
path through one of the rails and other paralleled 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
conductive infrastructure means that in many 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
cases breaks can only be detected in the other rail. 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
Hence broken rail detection is, at least in the UK, 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
now managed by the routine monitoring of the 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
rail condition including ultrasound scanning, not 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
by dependence upon track circuits. And of course, 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
as we shall see, axle counters are of no help at all 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
with broken rail detection.

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
Electric traction

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
On electrified railways, track circuits must operate 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
despite large traction return currents passing 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
along the same rails. The disparity is substantial, 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
with AC traction currents of 300A or more and 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
DC traction operating at up to 7000A. These 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
values exclude traction fault conditions and are far 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
larger than the track circuit currents which are a 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
few amps at most. This gives rise to the concept 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
of AC immune and DC immune track circuits. 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
There are also some areas that have both forms 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
of traction current supply which therefore require 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
dual immunity. 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
The initial way of providing immunity was to use 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
DC track circuits in AC territory and AC phase 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
sensitive vane relay track circuits in DC traction 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
territory. Where both types of traction were in 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
use it was not unusual to use a locally generated 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
special frequency to power AC track circuits, such 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
Below left: Rail breaks are 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
rarely as clear-cut as this 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
example, and not all rail 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
breaks will be detected by 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
track circuits – but no rail 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
breaks will be detected by 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
axle counters.

as 83.33Hz using rotary converters. This enabled 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
the track circuits to detect and respond to the 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
83.33Hz frequency but not DC or 50Hz AC.

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
Today, whilst these arrangements are still 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
common, there is a steady increase in the use of 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
modulated audio frequency track circuits selected 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
for immunity. This move is partly the result of the 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
application of three phase traction drives, which 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
produce many harmonics some of which are 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
present in the traction return currents. In practice 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
the range of frequencies produced by modern 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
three phase traction units makes it a challenge to 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
find immune frequencies suitable for track circuits. 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
This is also one of the reasons why there is a 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
trend to use axle counters as the modern form of 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
train detection. 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
Track circuit arrangements in electrified areas 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
are constrained by the need to ensure safe and 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
reliable operation of both signalling and traction 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
systems. This means that the track circuit must be 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
immune to both false operation and to damage 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
by the flow of traction currents through the rails. 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
This also causes complications because, while 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
the signalling track circuits are separated from 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
each other by IRJs, the traction current needs 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
a continuous electrical connection back to 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
the substation. 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
This problem has led to the use of impedance 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
bonds on double rail traction track circuits. These 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
are devices that present a low impedance to 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
traction current and a higher impedance to track 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
circuit current. In simple terms, they allow traction 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
current to pass along the rails and around the 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
IRJs, but stop the track circuit currents in order to 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
separate one track circuit from the next.

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
Although track circuits are designed to be immune 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
to false operation (wrong side failure) from the 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
presence of traction currents flowing in the rails, 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
any significant imbalance in the amount of current 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
flowing in the two rails may be misinterpreted by 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
the track circuit detector as indicating that the 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
track is unoccupied when it is not. In particular any 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
fast change in the traction current may cause a 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
Axle counters are 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
increasingly preferred as 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
a less intrusive means of 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
train detection.

--- Document Chunk 598 ---

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
short-term imbalance, which is why track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
on electrified lines are normally designed to be 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
slow to energise (i.e. slow to show track clear). 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
In DC electrified areas, the relatively low supply 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
voltage results in high currents returning to the 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
sub-stations via the running rails. In order to 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
minimise voltage drop and consequential power 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
losses in the DC-traction supply, all running 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
rails are used for the return of traction currents 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
wherever possible, and therefore double- rail track 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
circuits are used. There is usually cross bonding 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
between different tracks as well so that the current 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
has as many feed and return paths as possible, 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
again to minimise traction energy losses. As in AC 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
areas, impedance bonds are used to ensure the 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
traction current has a return path to the sub-

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
station, whilst the adjacent train detection sections 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
are kept separate from each other. In switches and 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
crossings, however, it is not usually possible to 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
bond the track in double-rail form, and therefore 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
single-rail track circuits must be installed. It should 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
be noted that ‘single rail’ track circuit really means 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
single rail traction current return, as both rails are 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
still used by the track circuit. 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
In AC overhead electrified areas, traction currents 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
are generally lower than in DC systems and, in 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
many cases, single rail traction return is sufficient 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
for electrification purposes. However, increased 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
traffic levels and alternative feeding arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
may sometimes require that both running rails are 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
used for traction return.

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
Coded track circuits

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
Coded track circuits can be used to transmit 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
information to a moving train. The amount of 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
information that can be communicated is limited 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
to simple messages, for example transmitting 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
one of a small number of modulations (14-20) 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
to send maximum safe speed and target speed 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
combination. Such systems can require extensive 

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
lineside equipment for each track circuit, 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
especially on bi-directionally signalling lines. For 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
the train to successfully detect the transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
information before it is shorted out by the train 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
“Coded track 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
circuits can be 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
used to transmit 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
information to a 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
moving train”

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
wheels it must always run towards the transmitter 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
end of the track circuit. Thus, on bidirectional lines 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
it is necessary to switch the feed and detector 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
(relay) ends of the track circuit depending on 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
the direction of travel of the signalled train. This 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
added complexity and the consequentially greater 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
failure risk is one of the reasons that modern 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
train supervision systems are generally moving 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
away from coded track circuits to radio-based 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
communication systems.

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
Axle counters

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
As its name suggests, an axle counter system used 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
track-mounted equipment to count axles entering 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
and leaving a track section. This information is 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
evaluated to determine whether the track section 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
is occupied or clear. They perhaps they should 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
be more accurately called wheel counters, since 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
the device attached to the rail uses a magnetic 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
field to detect the passage of the rim and flange 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
of a wheel. But because on most rail vehicles 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
the wheel is connected to an axle with another 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
wheel on the opposite side, they are called axle 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
counters. Each axle counter head usually has two 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
detectors on the rail, so the direction of travel 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
can be identified. The head is connected to an 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
evaluator which counts the number of wheels that 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
pass. To make a train detection section two heads 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
are connected to one evaluator, denoting the 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
ends of the train detection section. One counts 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
the wheels that enter the section and the other 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
subtracts the wheels that have left the section. If 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
the answer is zero the track section is deemed to 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
be clear of trains. Note that because both heads 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
can tell the direction of travel, both can either add 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
or subtract from the total. Typically, one head can 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
communicate with two evaluators, meaning one 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
head is used both to count axles exiting from one 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
section and entering the next.

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
As can be seen from the above description axle 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
counters depend on the equipment being able 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
to count and store in memory the number of 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
wheels that have passed. Such technology, as 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
well as the communication between the three 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
elements of the system, is much easier with 

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
modern computing systems and this explains 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
the relatively recent increase in their use in some 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
parts of the world. Other reasons for adoption are 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
they are very largely (although not completely) 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
immune to traction current interference; there is 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
no limitation on section length, so especially on 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
rural routes the volume of trackside equipment 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
and associated power supplies becomes much 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
smaller; and they are not influenced by rail head 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
or ballast resistance conditions. In addition, 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
the traction supply engineer is able to design 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
the traction return system including all the 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
cross bonding required, as well as the track 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
earthing connections for AC traction, without 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
the constraints of track circuit application rules. 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
Finally, there is no requirement for an IRJ or block 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
joint, which increases the integrity of the track 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
system and reduces costs. Axle counters are now 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
the preferred method of train detection for all 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
new schemes in Great Britain and in many other 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
countries throughout the world.

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
One particular advantage of axle counters over 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
track circuits is that they can be overlaid on 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
another detection system (whether track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
or another axle counter system) during a re-

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
signalling, thus enabling the new detection system 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
to be tested and proved to be operational before 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
it is required to control the railway. Compare this 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
with track circuits where only one track circuit can 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
be installed on a section of track at a time.

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
Axle counters are not without their problems, 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
however. An axle-counter section cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
made ‘occupied’ by the use of a track-circuit 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
operating device to protect a train, nor will 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
an axle-counter system detect a broken rail. 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
However, the introduction of train radio for 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
emergency communications has provided an 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
acceptable alternative to the use of track circuit 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
operating clips, and as referred to earlier, a track 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
circuit is not regarded as a reliable means of 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
detecting a broken rail.

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
More significantly, when an axle-counter system 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
fails it loses track of how many axles have passed 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
through it since the failure occurred. Therefore, 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
for safety, it is designed so that when the failure 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
is fixed, it shows the section of line as being 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
occupied, unlike a track circuit. The section then 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
needs to be proved clear of a train before the axle 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
counters can be reset and restored to operational 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
use, which can take some time.

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
Another problem with axle counters is that a 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
right-side failure can occur when a wheel stops 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
directly above the inductive sensor, known as 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
‘wheel rock’. When the train leaves there is a high 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
risk the section will remain occupied with no 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
train present and the time-consuming process 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
of reset and restore has to be carried out. That 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
can cause difficulties at a busy station, especially 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
if the platform is configured for multiple short 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
trains stopped at various locations along the same 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
platform. For these reasons, some sections of 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
railway (e.g. Thameslink in the UK) have decided to 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
retain track circuits where there are multiple split 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
sections along the platforms.

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
Cab signalling systems

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
Modern signalling has a greater dependence on 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
train-borne systems and communications, with 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
CBTC becoming the dominant form for metro 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
lines. These systems rely on the train regularly 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
reporting its location and other information to the 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
control centre, for which of course it requires a 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
reliable communication link. Wi-Fi or data enabled 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
radio (e.g. 4G/LTE) are used for the ground to train 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
communications, with 4G/LTE now becoming 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
favoured due to availability concerns with Wi-Fi. 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
Together with the use of ATP and ATO, these are 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
the key reasons why capacity can be increased 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
on metro routes. 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
ETCS is the equivalent of CBTC for main line 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
railways. However, enabling a main line train to 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
define its position accurately is a greater challenge 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
than is the case with metros (the latter invariably 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
having fixed formation trains). Whilst the leading 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
vehicle of a train may be able to inform the 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
control centre of its location and movement, it 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
is much more difficult to confirm the location 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
“One particular 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
advantage of axle 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
counters over 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
track circuits is 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
that they can 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
be overlaid 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
on another 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
detection 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
system”

of the rear of the train (unless the train is a fixed 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
formation). In particular it is difficult to confirm 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
that the train is still complete i.e. no vehicles have 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
been left behind due to detachment (known as 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
‘train integrity’). The lost wagon or coach on a 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
locomotive hauled train remains a significant 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
challenge for main line railways. Thus, although 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
ETCS level 2 can be operated without lineside 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
signals, it still uses trackside train detection based 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
on track circuits or axle counters. 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
ETCS level 3 is the conceptual system that 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
will enable trackside train detection to finally 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
be removed on main line railways, but when 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
we will see it deployed extensively is an open 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
question. The option of ETCS hybrid level 3 is one 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
way of gaining some of the benefits of Level 3 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
whilst avoiding the train integrity problem. In 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
hybrid level 3, fixed formation trains such as 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
multiple units, which can easily be confirmed 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
to be complete, are allowed to operate at 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
level 3 whereas others (loco hauled freight and 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
passenger trains) are operated in level 2. Thus, the 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
infrastructure is equipped with train detection, but 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
more than one level 3 train may occupy a given 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
train detection section at a time. Furthermore, if 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
the trains that are operating in level 2 in a hybrid 

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
level 3 area are sufficiently infrequent, it may be 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
possible to have longer train detection sections 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
and thus less trackside equipment on such lines. 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
ETCS standards currently specify that trains 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
identify their location using a combination 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
of balise reference points and tachometry, 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
supplemented by Doppler radar. However, there is 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
no fundamental reason why this information could 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
not be generated from Global Navigation Satellite 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
Systems (GNSS) such as GPS, or video tracking and 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
position identification, provided it can be proven 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
to meet the appropriate Safety Integrity Level (SIL). 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
Even in full level 3 areas, some track-based train 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
detection is still usually considered essential 

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
in locations where moveable infrastructure, 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
especially points, require locking. The provision 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
of some track-based train detection may 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
also help recovery to normal operations after 

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
an ETCS failure.

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
GNSS and Positive Train Control (PTC) 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
In the US, systems using GNSS are being 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
introduced as part of the requirement to introduce 

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
Positive Train Control (PTC) over some 60 000 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
miles of railways. The challenge of installing PTC 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
is further complicated by the fact that there are 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
ten different systems in use across the US. Some 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
systems use satellite links for train separation 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
and were designed for areas of ‘dark territory’ 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
where line-side signals and train detection are not 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
provided and instead trains are controlled by train 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
orders and track warrants.

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
As well as train location, GNSS based systems can 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
also be used for passenger information both on 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
trains and at stations. A further possible use of 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
GNSS is to trigger the warning on the approach 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
to a level crossing with a constant-time lapse 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
regardless of the speed of the train. In a similar 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
“Track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
will still be used 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
for many years to 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
come”

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
way, track workers could be alerted to the 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
approach of a train within a known fixed time.

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
However, for GNSS to work reliably there needs 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
to be clear ‘line of sight’ from trains to satellites, 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
which may be prevented by bridges, tunnels, 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
cuttings and on sub surface lines. GNSS also 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
presents a potential problem in that neither the 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
infrastructure manager nor the train operator 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
will have any control over the availability of 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
the GNSS signal.

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
Remote condition monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
Track circuits will still be used for many years to 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
come, not least because of the massive task of 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
replacing life-expired signalling some networks, 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
so clever asset management and maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
techniques will be required. One initiative that has 

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
helped reliability is remote condition monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
(RCM). By monitoring the track circuit current, 

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
potential failure modes can be predicted and 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
interventions planned before failure occurs. It is 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
not something that is easy to automate, but there 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
have been consequential improvements in track 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
circuit reliability, with potentially more to come.

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
One recent innovation involving the use of RCM 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
allows new jointless track circuits to be inspected 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
in real time from remote locations, thus improving 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
reliability. Prior to its implementation, track 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
circuits had to be checked on site using digital 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
multi-meters, which was a time-consuming 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
task and not conducive to finding faults before 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
they occurred. Axle-counter systems also have 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
sophisticated built-in remote diagnostics, and this 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
is one example of the digital railway delivering 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
results today. 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
Conclusion

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
The development of train detection systems 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
has been driven by need, accident and available 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
technology. Increasingly we are seeing the use 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
of train-based location systems, but track-based 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
systems will continue to be important for many 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
railways around the world. 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
Both of the major methods of track-based train 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
detection, namely track circuits and axle counters, 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
have their supporters and detractors. However, 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
for now at least, axle counters are used more than 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
track circuits for new signalling systems.

telecoms engineering that you’d like to 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
understand better. 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
