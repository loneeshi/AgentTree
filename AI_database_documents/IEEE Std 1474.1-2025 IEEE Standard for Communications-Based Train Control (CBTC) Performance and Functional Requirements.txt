Abstract: Performance and functional requirements for a communications-based train control 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
(CBTC) system are established in this standard. A CBTC system is a continuous, automatic train 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
control system utilizing high-resolution train location determination, independent of track circuits; 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
continuous, high-capacity, bidirectional train-to-wayside data communications; and train-borne and 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
wayside processors capable of implementing automatic train protection (ATP) functions, as well 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
as optional automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervision (ATS) functions. In 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
addition to CBTC functional requirements, this standard also defines headway criteria, system 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
safety criteria, and system availability criteria for a CBTC system. This standard is applicable to the 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
full range of transit applications including automated people movers. This standard establishes a 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
set of performance and functional requirements necessary for enhancing performance, availability, 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
operations, and train protection using a CBTC System.

Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE Standards Documents

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
IEEE Standards documents are made available for use subject to important notices and legal disclaimers. These 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
notices and disclaimers, or a reference to this page (https:// standards .ieee .org/ ipr/ disclaimers .html), appear in 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
all IEEE standards and may be found under the heading “Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
Standards Documents.”

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
Notice and Disclaimer of Liability Concerning the Use of IEEE Standards 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
Documents

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
IEEE Standards documents are developed within IEEE Societies and subcommittees of IEEE Standards 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
Association (IEEE SA) Board of Governors. IEEE develops its standards through an accredited consensus 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
development process, which brings together volunteers representing varied viewpoints and interests to 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
achieve the final product. IEEE standards are documents developed by volunteers with scientific, academic, 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
and industry-based expertise in technical working groups. V olunteers involved in technical working groups 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
are not necessarily members of IEEE or IEEE SA and participate without compensation from IEEE. While 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
IEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus development process, 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information or the soundness 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
of any judgments contained in its standards.

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
IEEE makes no warranties or representations concerning its standards, and expressly disclaims all warranties, 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
express or implied, concerning all standards, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement IEEE Standards documents do not guarantee safety, 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
security, health, or environmental protection, or compliance with law, or guarantee against interference with 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
or from other devices or networks. In addition, IEEE does not warrant or represent that the use of the material 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
contained in its standards is free from patent infringement. IEEE Standards documents are supplied “AS IS” 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
and “WITH ALL FAULTS.”

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
Use of an IEEE standard is wholly voluntary. The existence of an IEEE standard does not imply that there 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
are no other ways to produce, test, measure, purchase, market, or provide other goods and services related to 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
the scope of the IEEE standard. Furthermore, the viewpoint expressed at the time a standard is approved and 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
issued is subject to change brought about through developments in the state of the art and comments received 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
from users of the standard.

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
In publishing and making its standards available, IEEE is not suggesting or rendering professional or other 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
services for, or on behalf of, any person or entity, nor is IEEE undertaking to perform any duty owed by any 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
other person or entity to another. Any person utilizing any IEEE Standards document should rely upon their 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
own independent judgment in the exercise of reasonable care in any given circumstances or, as appropriate, 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
seek the advice of a competent professional in determining the appropriateness of a given IEEE standard.

Translations

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
The IEEE consensus balloting process involves the review of documents in English only. In the event that 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
an IEEE standard is translated, only the English language version published by IEEE is the approved IEEE 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
standard.

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
Use by artificial intelligence systems

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
In no event shall material in any IEEE Standards documents be used for the purpose of creating, training, 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
enhancing, developing, maintaining, or contributing to any artificial intelligence systems without the express, 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
written consent of IEEE SA in advance. “Artificial intelligence” refers to any software, application, or other 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
system that uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies, to analyze, train, process, or 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
generate content. Requests for consent can be submitted using the Contact Us form.

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
Official statements

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
A statement, written or oral, that is not processed in accordance with the IEEE SA Standards Board Operations 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
Manual is not, and shall not be considered or inferred to be, the official position of IEEE or any of its 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
committees and shall not be considered to be, or be relied upon as, a formal position of IEEE or IEEE SA. At 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
lectures, symposia, seminars, or educational courses, an individual presenting information on IEEE standards 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
shall make it clear that the presenter’s views should be considered the personal views of that individual rather 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
than the formal position of IEEE, IEEE SA, the Standards Committee, or the Working Group. Statements 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
made by volunteers may not represent the formal position of their employer(s) or affiliation(s). News releases 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
about IEEE standards issued by entities other than IEEE SA should be considered the view of the entity issuing 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
the release rather than the formal position of IEEE or IEEE SA.

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
Comments on standards

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
Comments for revision of IEEE Standards documents are welcome from any interested party, regardless of 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
membership affiliation with IEEE or IEEE SA. However, IEEE does not provide interpretations, consulting 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
information, or advice pertaining to IEEE Standards documents.

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of a proposed change of text, together with 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
appropriate supporting comments. Since IEEE standards represent a consensus of concerned interests, it is 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
important that any responses to comments and questions also receive the concurrence of a balance of interests. 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
For this reason, IEEE and the members of its Societies and subcommittees of the IEEE SA Board of Governors 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
are not able to provide an instant response to comments or questions, except in those cases where the matter 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
has previously been addressed. For the same reason, IEEE does not respond to interpretation requests. Any 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
person who would like to participate in evaluating comments or revisions to an IEEE standard is welcome to 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
join the relevant IEEE SA working group. You can indicate interest in a working group using the Interests tab 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
in the Manage Profile and Interests area of the IEEE SA myProject system.1 An IEEE Account is needed to 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
access the application.

Updating of IEEE Standards documents

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
Users of IEEE Standards documents should be aware that these documents may be superseded at any time 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
by the issuance of new editions or may be amended from time to time through the issuance of amendments, 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
corrigenda, or errata. An official IEEE document at any point in time consists of the current edition of the 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
document together with any amendments, corrigenda, or errata then in effect.

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
Every IEEE standard is subjected to review at least every 10 years. When a document is more than 10 years old 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
and has not undergone a revision process, it is reasonable to conclude that its contents, although still of some 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
value, do not wholly reflect the present state of the art. Users are cautioned to check to determine that they have 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
the latest edition of any IEEE standard.

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
In order to determine whether a given document is the current edition and whether it has been amended through 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
the issuance of amendments, corrigenda, or errata, visit IEEE Xplore or contact IEEE.3 For more information

Introduction

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
This introduction is not part of IEEE  Std 1474.1-2025, IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
(CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements.

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
This introduction provides some background on the rationale used to develop this standard. This information 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
is meant to aid in the understanding, usage, and applicability of this standard.

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
Conventional signaling/train control systems rely almost exclusively on track circuits to detect the presence of 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
trains. Information on the status of the track ahead is provided to train operators either through wayside signals 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
or train-borne cab signals. Ensuring compliance with the signals is achieved through operating procedures, 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
wayside automatic train stops, or train-borne supervisory equipment linked to the train’s braking system. 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
These conventional systems are effective in providing train protection, but are not particularly efficient 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
in maximizing the utilization of the rail transit infrastructure, as a result of a few fundamental limitations, 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
specifically, the following:

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
a) The location of trains can only be determined to the resolution of the track circuits; if any part of a 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
track circuit is occupied by a train, the whole track circuit shall be assumed to be occupied by the 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
train. Track circuits can be made shorter, but each additional track circuit requires additional wayside 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
hardware, so there is an economical and practical limit to the number of track circuits that can be 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
provided.

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
b) The information that can be provided to a train is limited to a small number of wayside signal aspects 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
or a small number of speed codes in a cab signal system.

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
c) For a wayside signal system with automatic train stops but without continuous cab signaling, 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
enforcement is intermittent.

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
Communications-based train control (CBTC) systems overcome these fundamental limitations of conventional 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
track circuit-based systems, and therefore, permit more effective utilization of the transit infrastructure. This 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
is accomplished, for example, by allowing trains to operate safely at much closer headways, by permitting 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
greater flexibility and greater precision in train control, and by providing continuous safe train separation 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
assurance and overspeed protection. Additional benefits of CBTC technology include the economical 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
support of automatic train operations (both on the mainline and in maintenance yards), improved reliability, 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
and reductions in maintenance costs through a reduction in wayside equipment and real-time diagnostic 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
information. The basic characteristics of a CBTC system include the following:

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
— Determination of train location, to a high degree of precision, independent of track circuits.

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
— A geographically continuous train-to-wayside and wayside-to-train data communications network 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
to permit the transfer of significantly more control and status information than is possible with 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
conventional systems.

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
— Wayside and train-borne vital processors to process the train status and control data and provide 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
continuous automatic train protection (ATP). Automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
(CBTC) system. It is divided into six clauses. Clause 1 describes the scope and purpose of this standard. 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
Clause 2 lists references that are useful in applying this standard. Clause 3 provides definitions that are 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
either not found in other standards or have been modified for use with this standard. Clause 4 defines the 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
general operating requirements for CBTC systems, including train operating modes to be supported. Clause 5 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
defines the performance requirements for CBTC systems, including headway criteria, system safety criteria, 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
and system availability criteria. Clause 6 defines the functional requirements for CBTC systems, including

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
performance, availability, operations, and train protection using a CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
1.2 Purpose

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
There are currently no independent standards defining the performance and functional requirements to be 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
and facilitates new CBTC applications.

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
1.3 Range of Applications

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
The CBTC performance and functional requirements defined in this standard are intended to be applicable 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
to the full range of transit applications, including commuter rail, heavy rail, light rail, and monorail transit 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
systems, and shall be applicable to other transit applications, such as automated people movers (APMs) if 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
CBTC is used for automated train control (ATC).

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
1.4 Existing Applications

--- Document Chunk 422 ---

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
without mentioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
required (should equals is recommended that).

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
The word may is used to indicate a course of action permissible within the limits of the standard (may equals 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
is permitted to).

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
The word can is used for statements of possibility and capability, whether material, physical, or causal ( can 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
equals is able to).

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
A typical functional block diagram for a CBTC system is given in Annex B.

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
4.3 Train Configurations

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a variety of train configurations, including the following:

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
a) Fixed-length unidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
b) Fixed-length bidirectional trains comprised of one or more basic operating units

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
c) Variable-length unidirectional trains

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
d) Variable-length bidirectional trains

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of supporting a mixed fleet of trains, where specific trains, and/or classes of 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
trains, have different performance characteristics.

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
4.4 Train operating modes

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
CBTC-equipped trains may be operated by either a single person or a multi-person crew. A CBTC system may 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
also be required to support operation of trains without crews.

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
For operation of trains with crews, the train operator will typically be stationed in the lead car of the train and 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
will be responsible for moving the train from station to station. With a multi-person crew, the conductor(s) will 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
normally operate from conductor position(s) within the train to operate the train’s doors. A CBTC system shall 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
support single-person train operation by combining the conductor and train operator display information on 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
the train operator’s display. For multi-person crews, conductor display information shall also be provided on 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
separate conductor displays.

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
For the purposes of this standard, operation of trains without crews includes both unattended and driverless 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
train operations. With unattended train operations, there would normally be no crew member onboard the 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
train. With driverless train operations, there may be a crew member onboard the train, but normally not in the 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
driving cab. This crew member, if present, would normally have no responsibility for operation of the train 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
except for failure recovery.

Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
CBTC-equipped trains (including CBTC-equipped maintenance vehicles) shall be capable of operating in 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
various modes, depending on whether the train is operating in CBTC territory or non-CBTC territory, and 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
depending on the operational status of the train-borne and/or wayside CBTC equipment.

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
Mixed-mode operation shall also be considered a normal operating mode, to the extent specified by the 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
authority having jurisdiction. Mixed-mode operation is defined as the simultaneous operation within CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
territory of CBTC-equipped trains and trains that are not equipped with functional train-borne CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
equipment (including maintenance vehicles). Mixed-mode operation may be used in one or more of the 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
following ways:

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
a) A regularly scheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
b) An infrequent, unscheduled mode of operation within CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
c) During the transition period only, as a new CBTC system is cut-in

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
d) As a result of train-borne CBTC equipment failures

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
4.4.1 Normal train operating modes in CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
4.4.1.1 CBTC-equipped trains

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
CBTC-equipped trains operating in CBTC territory shall operate, within ATP limits, under the protection of 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
the CBTC system. The train shall be capable of being controlled manually by a train operator or automatically 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
by the CBTC system (supervised by the train operator, if present), as specified by the authority having 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
jurisdiction. When operating automatically, some functions (such as door operation and train departure 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
initiation) may continue to be the responsibility of the train operator and/or conductor(s), if present.

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
4.4.1.2 Non-CBTC-equipped trains

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
Trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
equipment that are operating in CBTC territory shall operate under the protection of the CBTC system using 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
secondary train detection, or a supplementary systems and/or operating procedures, as specified by the 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
4.4.2 Failure mode train operations in CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
For light rail, heavy rail, monorail and commuter rail applications operating with crews, it is an operational 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
requirement to continue to move trains safely in the event of CBTC equipment and/or data communication 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
failures, possibly at reduced operating speeds and/or increased operating headways when compared to normal 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
train operations. Consequently, a CBTC system shall be designed to support degraded modes of operation 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
in the event of failure and to continue to provide ATP with minimum reliance on adherence to operating 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
procedures as specified by authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
For fully automated applications operating without crews, the extent to which the CBTC system shall be 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
designed to support degraded modes of operation in the event of failure shall be as defined by the authority 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
having jurisdiction, and may include an ability to remotely reset train-borne equipment and the ability to 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
support automatic push/pull train recovery, as well as the ability to support manual train operations and 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
alternative routing strategies.

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
For all applications, a fallback plan, based on failure analysis and operating procedures, shall identify train 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
operating modes that will take advantage of the degraded modes of operation and recovery capabilities of the 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
CBTC system. The goal of the plan shall be to eliminate hazards to passengers and staff in accordance with 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
5.3, while continuing to provide passenger service.

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
Specifically, failure mode train operations in CBTC territory shall address those CBTC system failures 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
affecting the following:

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
a) All trains operating within a particular area of control

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
b) A particular train operating within any area of control

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
4.4.2.1 CBTC system failures affecting all trains operating within a particular area of control

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
In the event of a CBTC system failure that affects all CBTC-equipped trains operating within a particular area 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
of control within CBTC territory (e.g., wayside CBTC equipment or wayside-to-train data communications 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
failure), trains shall have the capability to provide continued safe operations under the control of an operator, 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
and the following:

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
a) With the protection of a supplementary system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures (as defined by authority having jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within individual train-borne CBTC equipment 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
4.4.2.2 CBTC system failures affecting a particular train operating within any area of control

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
In the event of a CBTC system failure affecting a particular CBTC-equipped train operating within any area 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
of control within CBTC territory (e.g., train-borne CBTC equipment failure), that train shall be capable of 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
continued safe operations under the control of an operator, and the following:

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
a) With the protection of a supplementary system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures; or

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
When operating in this failure mode, ATP functions that reside within wayside CBTC equipment and within 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
other train-borne CBTC equipment shall continue to function to the extent safety can be assured.

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
4.4.3 Normal train operating modes in non-CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
CBTC equipment installed on trains operating in non-CBTC territory shall include the necessary capabilities 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
to support transitions into CBTC territory. In addition, if specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
borne CBTC equipment may also perform other ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, such as 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
limiting train speed and/or providing zero speed detection.

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, train-borne CBTC equipment operating in non-CBTC territory 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
may also interface with wayside equipment that is not fully compatible with the train-borne CBTC equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
In no case, however, shall the train-borne CBTC equipment provide an indication of standard CBTC operation 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
when operating in non-CBTC territory, unless the applicable authority or authorities having jurisdiction 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
over the train-borne and wayside equipment have ensured that standard CBTC operation is supported by the 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
integrated train-borne and wayside systems.

4.4.4 Failure mode train operations in non-CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
Except where specified to perform certain ATP functions while operating in non-CBTC territory, failure of the 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
train-borne CBTC equipment shall have minimal impact on train operation. The failure shall be indicated to 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
the train operator, if present.

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
4.5 Entering/exiting CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
4.5.1 Entering into CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
A CBTC system shall have precise knowledge of the limits of CBTC territory and shall include the capability 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
to perform verification checks of the train-borne CBTC equipment prior to entering CBTC territory. The 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
checks shall be performed sufficiently in advance of entry into CBTC territory to verify the proper operation 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
of the train-borne CBTC equipment (including any wayside CBTC equipment dependencies).

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
If the verification check is passed, an indication to this effect shall be provided. Under normal circumstances 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
and subject to ATP constraints, it shall not be necessary for a train to come to a stop when entering CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
territory unless required for other operational reasons.

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
In the event that the verification check fails, an indication of the CBTC system failure shall be provided, and 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
the train shall be capable of continued safe operations under the control of an operator, and

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
a) With the protection of a supplementary system (if specified by the authority having jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
b) With the train speed limited by the propulsion system; or

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
c) Through strict adherence to operating procedures (as defined by authority having jurisdiction); or

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
d) A combination of any or all of items a), b), and c).

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
The results of the verification checks shall be displayed on the ATS user interface. For trains operating with 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
crews, the results of the verification checks shall also be indicated to the train operator.

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
4.5.2 Exiting from CBTC territory

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
For trains operating with crews, prior to exiting CBTC territory, a CBTC system may provide a visual 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
indication to the train operator of time and/or distance until the train will be exiting the CBTC territory. When 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
known by the CBTC system, the train operator may also receive an indication of the type of train control 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
system into which the train will be traversing.

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
NOTE—Indications to the train operator may not be required if the transition between CBTC territory and non-CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
territory is operationally transparent to the train operator. Under normal circumstances and subject to ATP constraints, it 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
is not necessary for a train to come to a stop when exiting CBTC territory unless required for other operational reasons.

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
4.6 Train operating speeds

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of meeting the performance and functional requirements of this standard, 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
over the full range of possible train operating speeds specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 785 ---

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
5. Performance requirements

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
5.1 CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
The required design and operating headways (i.e., the minimum and scheduled headways) for both normal 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
and reverse directions shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. Headway may be specified as 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
uninterfered and/or interfered.

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
In all cases, the design headway shall be constrained by the safe train separation requirements and the safe 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
braking model of 6.1.2.1.

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
In the case of an uninterfered headway, a train speed profile shall not be affected by a preceding train. All 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
trains shall, therefore, perform at the maximum allowed speed, depending on the civil speed limits and the 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
acceleration and braking capabilities of the trains themselves. Operation at uninterfered headways facilitates a 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
minimum end-to-end trip time for a given set of station dwell times.

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
Headways may be reduced (at the expense of increased trip times) with an interfered headway where a train 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
speed profile is affected by a preceding train such that a following train decelerates on the approach to a station 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
and enters the station area at a reduced speed. Interfered headway may also be specified to support multiple 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
berthings at a station platform.

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
The design headway for a particular line and a particular set of vehicles involves many factors that are out- 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
side the control of the CBTC system (e.g., track alignment, gradients, civil speed limits, train acceleration and 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
braking rates, station dwell times, terminal track configurations, driver reaction times). These factors shall be 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
specified by the authority having jurisdiction. These standard addresses only those CBTC factors contributing 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
to achievable headways, of which the most significant are the following:

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
a) Location (both accuracy of measured end-of-train locations and resolution of movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
limits for a given train), including the frequency at which location reports and movement authorities 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
are updated.

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
b) Speed, including both accuracy of speed measurement and resolution of speed limits established for a 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
given train at a given location.

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
c) Communications delays, including nominal and worst-case transmission times of command/status 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
messages between wayside and train, and vice versa. (Command/status messages include, for 

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
example, messages related to movement authority updates and/or location report updates.)

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
d) CBTC equipment reaction times, including maximum error accumulation, for both wayside and train-

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
borne equipment, and for various operating modes, as applicable. (CBTC equipment reaction times 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
include, for example, the time required to establish new movement authority limits following location 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
report updates, the time to establish new movement authority limits through an interlocking, and the 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
time to determine a new ATP profile following movement authority update.)

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
e) CBTC system performance limitations (e.g., the maximum number of trains that can be processed by 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
the CBTC system, within a given area of control).

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
f) CBTC automatic speed regulation algorithm.

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
Typical values for the CBTC parameters in items a) through e) are given in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
5.2 CBTC factors contributing to achievable trip times

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
Trip time requirements shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, consistent with train performance 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
and track alignment characteristics.

--- Document Chunk 829 ---

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
The minimum end-to-end trip times for a defined set of station dwell times results from uninterfered headway 

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
speed profiles. The CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways, as identified in 5.1, are also factors 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
contributing to the minimum achievable trip times.

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
5.3 System safety requirements

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
5.3.1 CBTC System Safety Program requirements

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
A System Safety Program shall be instituted during the CBTC system planning/design phase and shall 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
continue throughout the system life cycle. The CBTC System Safety Program shall emphasize the prevention 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
of accidents by identifying and resolving hazards in a systematic manner. A CBTC System Safety Program 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
Plan (SSPP) shall be developed for each CBTC application. The CBTC SSPP, as a minimum, shall be prepared 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
in accordance with the requirements of E.1 of Annex E.

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
Implementation of the CBTC SSPP shall specifically recognize configuration management issues, given the 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
importance of software and hardware configuration control in maintaining system safety.

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
5.3.2 CBTC hazard identification and risk assessment process

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
Hazard analyses shall be employed during the design of a CBTC system to assist in the identification and 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
evaluation of potential hazards to assess their likelihood and severity and to document their resolution. As a 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
minimum, a preliminary hazard analysis (PHA) shall be conducted for each new CBTC system project. Other 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
detailed analyses, including system/subsystem hazard analyses, failure modes, effects and criticality analyses, 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
fault tree analyses, and operational and support hazard analyses, shall also be conducted if man- dated by 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
the CBTC SSPP. These analyses shall be conducted in accordance with E.2, E.3, E.4, and E.5 of Annex E or 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
equivalent requirements, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
All hazards identified through the CBTC System Safety Program shall be assessed in terms of the severity or 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
consequence of the hazard and the probability of occurrence. This shall be accomplished in general accordance 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
with the criteria outlined in E.6 of Annex E or the equivalent, as approved by the authority having jurisdiction. 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
Risk assessment estimates shall be used as the basis in the decision-making process to determine whether 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
individual system or subsystem hazards shall be eliminated, mitigated, or accepted. This process shall include 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
full documentation of the hazard resolution activities.

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
Hazards shall be resolved through a design process that emphasizes the elimination of the hazard. The 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
effectiveness of the hazard resolution strategies and countermeasures shall be monitored to determine that no 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
new hazards are introduced. In addition, whenever substantive changes are made to the system, analyses shall 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
be conducted to identify and resolve any new hazards.

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
As a minimum, a CBTC system shall address the following critical/catastrophic system hazards through the 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
implementation of the ATP functions defined in 6.1:

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
a) Train-to-train collisions (rear-end, sideswipe, head-on); hazard to be addressed through train 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
separation assurance (see 6.1.2), rollback protection (see 6.1.4), parted train protection (see 6.1.6), 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
route interlocking protection (see 6.1.11), and travel direction reversal interlocks (see 6.1.12)

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
b) Train-to-structure collisions; hazard to be addressed through end-of-track protection (see 6.1.5) and 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
restricted route protection (see 6.1.16)

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
c) Train derailments; hazard to be addressed through overspeed protection (see 6.1.3), route interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
protection (see 6.1.11), and (where specified by the authority having jurisdiction) broken rail detection 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
(see 6.1.14)

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
d) Collisions between trains and highway vehicles (where highway crossing at grade exists within the 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
limits of CBTC territory); hazard to be addressed through grade-crossing warning devices that may 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
include interfaces to the CBTC system (see 6.1.15)

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
e) Hazards to work crews and work trains; hazards to be addressed through CBTC work zone protection 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
functions (see 6.1.13)

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
f) Hazards to passengers associated with train movement with train doors open; hazards to be addressed 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
through interface between the CBTC system and the train door system (where required by the authority 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
having jurisdiction) to provide door opening control protection interlocks (see 6.1.8), zero speed 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
detection (see 6.1.7), platform interlocks (see 6.1.9) and where applicable, hazards to passengers 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
associated with train movement with platform edge doors open.

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
g) Hazards associated with collisions with objects on the track; hazards to be addressed through interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
between the CBTC system and restricted route protections (where specified by the authority having 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
jurisdiction) (see 6.1.16)

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
5.3.3 CBTC vital functions

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
To eliminate or control to a level acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction those hazards judged to be 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
unacceptable or undesirable through the risk assessment process of 5.3.2, a CBTC system shall include, as a 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
minimum, the vital functions identified in 6.1.

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
All vital functions of a CBTC system shall be designed and implemented in accordance with fail-safe 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
principles. Documentation of the means used, and proof that fail-safe principles have been met and the mean 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
time between hazardous event (MTBHE) requirements of 5.3.4 have been satisfied, shall be required for every 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
Verification that the processor-based portions of a CBTC system meet these minimum system safety 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
requirements shall be completed in accordance with IEEE Std 1483-2000.12

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
5.3.4 Quantitative CBTC safety performance requirements

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
For any CBTC system application, the CBTC wayside and train-borne equipment located within any 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
contiguous portion of a one-way route that can be traversed by a train traveling at the specified maximum 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
authorized speed for one hour or less shall have a total calculated aggregate MTBHE (total of all critical and 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
catastrophic hazards) of at least 109 operating hours. This includes the maximum number of other trains that 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
can be located in this contiguous portion of a one-way route under the specified peak operating headway. 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
System safety documentation shall support these calculations and substantiate the methodology used to arrive 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
at the result. For the purposes of MTBHE calculations, a hazardous event shall include, as a minimum, the 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
occurrence of any of the specific hazards identified in 5.3.2.

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
NOTE—If the end-to-end trip time for a given route is greater than 1 h, the MTBHE requirement for that route would be 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
adjusted proportionately. As an illustrative example, if the specified end-to-end trip time (per 5.2) for a given one-way 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
route is 2 h, and if the route includes 4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment, and if a maximum of 10 trains can be operating 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
on the route at a given time (when operating at the specified peak headway, per 5.1), then the MTBHE of the combined 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
4 sets of wayside CBTC equipment and 10 sets of train-borne CBTC equipment on that route would be at least 0.5 × 109 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
operating hours.

A CBTC system shall respond safely and correctly perform all ATP functions within the normal range of 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
inputs and other operating and environmental conditions.

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
All conditions necessary for the existence of any permissive state or action shall be verified to be present 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
before the permissive state or action is initiated by a CBTC system. The requisite conditions shall be verified 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
to be continuously present for the permissive state or action to be maintained.

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
System safety shall not depend on the correctness of actions taken or procedures used by operating personnel.

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
Procedures shall not be considered a substitute for safety functions that are to be vested in specific CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
components or equipment, or secondary train detection systems.

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
5.3.5.2 Abnormal transit system operations with no CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
A CBTC system shall respond safely under conditions of abnormal system loading, abnormal/improper inputs, 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
and other abnormal external influences such as electrical, mechanical, and environmental factors.

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
A CBTC system shall respond safely to abnormal conditions as required by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
5.3.5.3 Response to CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
A CBTC system shall respond safely under conditions of credible hardware failure.

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
NOTE—The AREMA Communications and Signals Manual, Part 17.3.3 [B1]13, provides examples of credible hardware 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
failures.

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
Failure to perform a logical operation or absence of a logical input, output, or decision shall not cause an 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
unsafe condition, i.e., system safety shall not depend upon the occurrence of an action or logical decision.

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
Hazard analyses shall consider all credible CBTC hardware failure modes. Justification shall be provided 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
for conceivable failure modes that are not considered credible. Each credible CBTC failure mode shall be 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
classified as a combination of either self-revealing or non-self-revealing, and the effect shall be considered as 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
follows:

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
a) No credible single point CBTC hardware failure, whether self-revealing or non-self-revealing, shall 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
cause an unsafe condition.

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
b) No credible CBTC hardware failure in combination with one or more non-self-revealing failure shall 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
cause an unsafe condition. In the instance of a non-self-revealing failure, a subsequent failure shall not 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
be considered independent.

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
c) The probability of a critical or catastrophic hazard arising as a result of combinations of simultaneous 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
independent self-revealing failures shall be considered in the calculated CBTC MTBHE.

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
5.3.5.4 Recovery from CBTC hardware failures

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
A combination of functional elements of the CBTC system itself, supplementary systems (if specified by the 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
authority having jurisdiction), and/or operating procedures shall provide for the safety of train movement 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
under failure conditions, including failure recovery.

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
5.4 System assurance requirements

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
5.4.1 General

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
The ability of a CBTC system to accomplish the functional requirements of this standard, under normal 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
conditions and under conditions of equipment failure, is of paramount importance to the authority having 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
jurisdiction. This sub clause establishes qualitative reliability, availability, and maintainability criteria for 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
CBTC systems and equipment in order to meet or exceed the on-time performance and fleet availability 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
objectives of the authority having jurisdiction, and thereby minimize delays experienced by passengers. In 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
addressing CBTC equipment failures, a distinction shall be made between the following failure types:

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
a) Type 1: Those failures, or combination of failures, that impact on-time performance of the transit 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
system.

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
b) Type 2: Those failures, or combination of failures, that do not impact on-time performance of the 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
transit system, but do result in some other loss of specified CBTC functionality.

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
c) Type 3: Those failures that do not impact on-time performance of the transit system or result in a loss 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
of any specified CBTC functionality (e.g., because of equipment redundancy).

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
The CBTC system availability requirement (see 5.4.2) shall include consideration of all Type 1 failures, as 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
well as the mean time to restore service (MTTRS) for Type 1 failures.

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
The CBTC system mean time between functional failure (MTBFF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
consideration of all Type 1 and Type 2 failures.

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
The CBTC system mean time between failure (MTBF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include consideration of 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
all Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 failures.

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
While system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF predictions traditionally consider only hard- 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
ware failures, measurements of achieved system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF shall also 

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
consider software errors (i.e., software fails to perform intended function) as well as hardware failures.

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
The following general recommended practices apply:

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
— Components and materials should be selected and appropriate standards of quality control and test 

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
procedures should be employed to obtain the lowest practical hardware failure rates for individual 

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
items of CBTC equipment (i.e., maximize the hardware portion of the system MTBF).

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
— Unless non-redundant equipment is sufficiently reliable to satisfy the overall system availability 

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
requirements, appropriate levels of equipment redundancy should be employed such that the failure 

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
of a single component, processor, or device does not render the CBTC system unavailable or an 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
operationally-critical function nonoperative (i.e., maximize the system MTBFF).

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
— A CBTC system should incorporate degraded modes of operation to minimize the operational impacts 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
of equipment failures and to permit train movements to continue safely (i.e., maximize system 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
availability).

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
— CBTC system downtime or unavailability of an operationally-critical function should be minimized 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
through the use of local and remote diagnostic capabilities and appropriate operating and maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
procedures [i.e., minimize mean time to repair (MTTR)].

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
5.4.2 System availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
Quantitative CBTC system availability requirements shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
with appropriate consideration of the impacts of CBTC system and subsystem failures on the operation of the 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
transit system. Typical methods for defining CBTC system availability are provided in Annex F.

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability analysis/modeling shall be used to predict 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
the system availability for a given CBTC system configuration, based on equipment reliability/ maintainability 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
calculations, equipment redundancy provisions, and other defined assumptions.

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
As specified by the authority having jurisdiction, system availability demonstration tests shall be performed to 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
determine actual CBTC system availability over a defined period, to a given confidence level.

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
5.4.3 Equipment reliability requirements

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
Quantitative CBTC system and subsystem MTBF and MTBFF requirements shall be established by the 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
authority having jurisdiction, consistent with the CBTC system availability requirement of 5.4.2.

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
5.4.3.1 Design life

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
CBTC system shall have a design life of a minimum 30 years.

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
NOTE—The ability of a CBTC system to remain in operation to the end of its design life is driven largely by long-term 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
availability of spare parts and the state of good repair and maintenance plans. Specific requirements with respect to spare 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
part availability are defined by the authority having jurisdiction and do not form part of this standard.

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
5.4.4 Equipment maintainability requirements

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
A CBTC system shall be designed to minimize required maintenance (predictive, preventive, and corrective) 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
by maximizing the system MTBF and by including features that provide for ease of maintenance by 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
maintenance personnel.

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
The mean time to repair/replace a failed piece of in-service CBTC equipment (i.e., first-level repair) shall 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
include on-site diagnostics, the replacement of failed components, and the testing of the repaired units, sub- 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
system, or system, but shall exclude travel time to the site. A separate MTTR requirement may be defined for 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
second-level repair (i.e., shop repair of a failed line replaceable unit).

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
The first-level MTTR shall be no greater than 30 min. The second-level MTTR, if specified, shall be no greater 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
than 2 h.

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
Achievable repair times is driven by equipment diagnostic provisions and available test equipment, as well as 

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
the quality of the maintenance manuals and training. A CBTC system shall, therefore, include maintenance and 

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
diagnostic capabilities to detect and react to CBTC equipment failures. This shall include remote diagnostics 

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---
capabilities as well as local built-in test equipment and other fault displays for trouble- shooting, and the 

--- Document Chunk 1032 ---
timely identification of failed components and functions.

--- Document Chunk 1033 ---
Data logging capabilities shall also be provided in wayside and train-borne CBTC equipment. The logged data 

--- Document Chunk 1034 ---
shall be capable of being analyzed to be able to recreate the sequence of events leading to an incident. This 

--- Document Chunk 1035 ---
allows maintenance personnel to identify the cause of any failure and/or mis-operation of CBTC equipment 

--- Document Chunk 1036 ---
that cannot be identified by the in-built diagnostics of the equipment. The scope and duration of logged CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
events shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
A CBTC system design shall include capabilities to permit periodic verification of ATP hardware, software, 

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
and data, including verification of correct response to interference on the train-to-wayside data link. To the 

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall also include capabilities to facilitate

modifications (by the user) to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and applications software. The 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
supplier of the CBTC system shall identify to the authority having jurisdiction those specific changes to CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
system parameters, track databases, and applications software that have no impact on system safety.

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
WARNING

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
Changes made to CBTC system parameters, track databases, and application software, other than those 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
identified by the supplier as not impacting safety, can affect safe system operation. Prior to implementing 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
any such changes, applicable hazard analyses of 5.3.2 shall be reassessed to verify that the modified system 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
will still meet all requirements of this standard including, but not limited to, 5.3.3, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5. Changes 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
shall be implemented in accordance with the CBTC SSPP of 5.3.1.

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
5.5 Environmental requirements

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
Train-borne CBTC equipment shall comply with the requirements of IEEE Std 1478-2013.

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
Wayside CBTC equipment shall be in accordance with requirements set by authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
6. Functional requirements

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---
A CBTC system shall include the capability for providing ATP, ATO, and ATS functions. ATP functions shall 

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
provide fail-safe protection against collisions, excessive speed, and other hazardous conditions. ATP functions 

--- Document Chunk 1060 ---
shall have precedence over both the ATO and ATS functions. ATO functions shall control basic operations that 

--- Document Chunk 1061 ---
would otherwise be performed by a train operator and shall do so within the protection limits imposed by ATP. 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
ATS functions shall provide system status information and the means to monitor and over- ride the automatic 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
control for various functions of the system.

--- Document Chunk 1064 ---
The CBTC train-to-wayside communications interface shall be sufficient to support all required ATP, ATO, 

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
and ATS functions. The data link shall provide continuous geographic coverage within CBTC territory and 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
shall support train operations in tunnels, tubes, and cuts, on elevated structures, and at grade. The data link 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
shall support bidirectional data transfer and shall exhibit sufficiently low latency to support the defined 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
performance requirements. The data link shall include a protocol structure to support safe, timely, and secure 

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
delivery of train control messages.

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
6.1 ATP functions

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
All ATP functions shall be vital functions and shall be designed and implemented in accordance with 5.3. A 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
CBTC system shall be capable of providing bidirectional ATP.

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
6.1.1 Train location/train speed determination

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
6.1.1.1 CBTC train location/train speed determination

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
CBTC train location/train speed determination shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system 

--- Document Chunk 1076 ---
configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1077 ---
A CBTC system shall establish the location, speed, and travel direction of each CBTC-equipped train operating 

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
in CBTC territory.

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
CBTC train location determination shall safely and accurately establish the location of both the front and rear 

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
of the train. The CBTC train location determination function shall provide sufficient train location resolution 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
and accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Train location resolution 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
28

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
The CBTC train location determination function shall be self-initializing and shall automatically detect and 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
establish the location and length of each CBTC-equipped train as it enters CBTC territory and on recovery 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
from CBTC equipment failures, without requiring manual input of train location or train length data.

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
When awakening from sleep mode, CBTC equipment shall maintain or vitally re-establish train location.

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
The CBTC train speed determination function shall provide sufficient speed measurement resolution and 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
accuracy to support the performance and safety requirements of this standard. Speed measurement resolution 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
and accuracy parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
A CBTC system shall compensate for the effects of measurement inaccuracies on train location and speed 

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
determination. Specifically, if the CBTC train location/speed determination function is dependent upon wheel 

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
rotation, the CBTC system shall correct for position errors induced by the slipping or sliding of wheels and 

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
shall correct for position errors caused by variation in wheel size due to wear, trueing, or replacement.

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
6.1.1.2 Secondary train location determination

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, secondary train detection technology may be used to establish 

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
if a section of track is occupied by one or more trains, including trains not equipped with train-borne CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1101 ---
equipment and/or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment. This may be provided as part of 

--- Document Chunk 1102 ---
supplementary systems or directly input or integrated into the CBTC system. It will not be necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 1103 ---
determine the location of non-CBTC-equipped trains, or trains with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment, 

--- Document Chunk 1104 ---
to the same accuracy as CBTC-equipped trains.

--- Document Chunk 1105 ---
6.1.2 Safe train separation

--- Document Chunk 1106 ---
Safe train separation shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1107 ---
Safe train separation shall be provided between all trains operating in CBTC territory, whether or not the trains 

--- Document Chunk 1108 ---
are CBTC equipped.

--- Document Chunk 1109 ---
A CBTC system shall provide safe train separation between CBTC-equipped trains. Safe train separation shall 

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
be based upon the principle of an instantaneous (brick wall) stop of the preceding train.

--- Document Chunk 1111 ---
For mixed-mode operation (see 4.4), safe train separation shall be provided through supplementary systems 

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
and/or through strict adherence to operating procedures, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
If secondary train location determination is provided (see 6.1.1.2), then for a CBTC-equipped train following 

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative train-borne CBTC equipment, a CBTC system shall 

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
limit the movement authority of the following train to the boundary of the section of track occupied by the 

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
non-CBTC-equipped or failed train. If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC system may 

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
further limit the movement authority to the route entry point of a route occupied by the non-CBTC-equipped 

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
train or failed train.

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
The CBTC safe train separation function shall consist of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
a) The calculation of the ATP profile (i.e., the profile of safe speed as a function of train location), derived 

--- Document Chunk 1121 ---
from fixed ATP data (e.g., permanent speed limits) and variable ATP data (e.g., temporary speed limits 

--- Document Chunk 1122 ---
and movement authority limit)

--- Document Chunk 1123 ---
b) The supervision and enforcement of the ATP profile calculated by the CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1124 ---
The ATP profile shall be governed by a safe braking model (see 6.1.2.1) and shall ensure that under no 

--- Document Chunk 1125 ---
circumstances (including failures) will the movement authority limit be exceeded by a CBTC-equipped train.

--- Document Chunk 1126 ---

--- Document Chunk 1129 ---
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.

--- Document Chunk 1130 ---
The movement authority limit shall be the most restrictive of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1131 ---
a) The rear of a CBTC-equipped train ahead (as determined by the CBTC train location function in 

--- Document Chunk 1132 ---
6.1.1.1), with allowance for any location uncertainty

--- Document Chunk 1133 ---
b) The boundary of a section of track occupied by a non-CBTC-equipped train or a train with inoperative 

--- Document Chunk 1134 ---
train-borne CBTC equipment (as determined by a secondary train detection system, if provided, per 

--- Document Chunk 1135 ---
6.1.1.2)

--- Document Chunk 1136 ---
c) The end-of-track (see 6.1.5)

--- Document Chunk 1137 ---
d) The entrance to an interlocking, when the route is not verified as aligned and locked (see 6.1.11)

--- Document Chunk 1138 ---
e) The boundary of a section of track with an opposing authorized travel direction or conflicting routing 

--- Document Chunk 1139 ---
established (see 6.1.12)

--- Document Chunk 1140 ---
f) The boundary of a blocked track (see 6.1.13)

--- Document Chunk 1141 ---
g) If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the entrance to a highway grade crossing where 

--- Document Chunk 1142 ---
warning devices are not confirmed to be operating (see 6.1.15)

--- Document Chunk 1143 ---
h) The entrance to a route that is detected to be unsafe for train movement (see 6.1.16)

--- Document Chunk 1144 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, the CBTC safe train separation function shall support 

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
automatic close-up of trains and automatic coupling and uncoupling of trains in designated areas.

--- Document Chunk 1146 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to bypass the CBTC safe train 

--- Document Chunk 1147 ---
separation function to allow a train, under the control of a train operator, to travel beyond its movement 

--- Document Chunk 1148 ---
authority limit (e.g., at a restricted speed).

--- Document Chunk 1149 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided to pull back (i.e., make more 

--- Document Chunk 1150 ---
restrictive) a movement authority limit previously granted to a train. If the train were approaching or braking 

--- Document Chunk 1151 ---
toward the original movement authority limit, the train may be in violation of the new ATP profile. Under 

--- Document Chunk 1152 ---
such circumstances, a CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application. The brake application may 

--- Document Chunk 1153 ---
be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake application, as specified by the 

--- Document Chunk 1154 ---
authority having jurisdiction (see 6.1.3).

--- Document Chunk 1155 ---
6.1.2.1 Safe braking model

--- Document Chunk 1156 ---
A safe braking model shall be developed for each CBTC application.

--- Document Chunk 1157 ---
The safe braking model shall, as a minimum, include consideration of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1158 ---
a) Location uncertainty of lead train (including rollback tolerance)

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
b) Train length

--- Document Chunk 1160 ---
c) Train configuration (see 4.3)

--- Document Chunk 1161 ---
d) Allowable overspeed permitted by the CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1162 ---
e) Maximum CBTC speed measurement error

--- Document Chunk 1163 ---
f) CBTC system reaction times and latencies

--- Document Chunk 1164 ---
g) Maximum train acceleration rate possible at the time an overspeed condition is detected by the CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1165 ---
system

--- Document Chunk 1166 ---
h) Worst-case reaction times to disable the propulsion system and apply the emergency brakes following 

--- Document Chunk 1167 ---
detection of an overspeed condition by the CBTC system

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
i) Guaranteed emergency brake rate (GEBR)

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
j) Grade

--- Document Chunk 1173 ---
Copyright © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.

--- Document Chunk 1174 ---
The GEBR shall be the minimum emergency brake rate achieved by a train on level tangent track under the 

--- Document Chunk 1175 ---
range of environmental conditions and worst-case credible latent brake equipment failure modes, which can 

--- Document Chunk 1176 ---
be anticipated to exist for that train in the specific application. The GEBR shall be specified by the authority 

--- Document Chunk 1177 ---
having jurisdiction and shall include consideration of maximum train load, minimum anticipated adhesion 

--- Document Chunk 1178 ---
levels, and maximum design tailwind.

--- Document Chunk 1179 ---
A typical safe braking model is provided in Annex D.

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
A CBTC system shall have the capability to support multiple safe braking models to accommodate different 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
train acceleration/braking rates for different classes and configurations of trains operating simultaneously 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
within CBTC territory and to accommodate automatic close-up and automatic coupling/uncoupling 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
capabilities, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A CBTC system shall incorporate appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
protection to ensure that the correct safe braking model is applied for a given train at a given location.

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
6.1.3 Overspeed protection and brake assurance

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
Overspeed protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
In establishing, supervising, and enforcing the ATP profile, as governed by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1, a 

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
CBTC system shall ensure that under no circumstances, including failures, the train’s actual speed exceeds its 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
safe speed. The safe speed shall be derived by considering the most restrictive of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
a) The permanent speed limits on sections of track within the ATP profile

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
b) Any temporary speed restrictions on sections of track within the ATP profile

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
c) Any permanent speed restriction applicable to the particular class or configuration of train

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
d) Any speed restrictions enforced on the train because of train-borne failure conditions

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
e) The maximum speed that would allow the train to stop safely prior to the limit of the train’s movement 

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---
authority or to slow down sufficiently to meet appropriate permanent or temporary speed restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 1196 ---
upon entering that section of track

--- Document Chunk 1197 ---
Speed limits and restrictions shall apply when any portion of the train is within the speed limit area. Speed 

--- Document Chunk 1198 ---
limit/speed restriction resolution parameters for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1199 ---
Enforcement of the calculated ATP profile shall be achieved by comparing the CBTC-determined train speed 

--- Document Chunk 1200 ---
with the ATP profile speed at the CBTC-determined train location. If the ATP profile speed at that location is 

--- Document Chunk 1201 ---
exceeded, the CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1202 ---
The brake application may be an immediate emergency brake application or a supervised service brake 

--- Document Chunk 1203 ---
application, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. In the latter case, a CBTC system shall monitor 

--- Document Chunk 1204 ---
the achieved brake rate to determine that an acceptable brake rate is achieved within a predetermined 

--- Document Chunk 1205 ---
time frame; if not, it shall immediately apply the emergency brakes. The safe braking model shall include 

--- Document Chunk 1206 ---
appropriate allowances for reaction times associated with this brake assurance function.

--- Document Chunk 1207 ---
6.1.4 Rollback protection

--- Document Chunk 1208 ---
Rollback protection shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system configuration.

--- Document Chunk 1209 ---
A CBTC system shall monitor actual train travel direction and shall compare measured travel direction with 

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
the authorized travel direction. Train motion against the authorized travel direction for more than a specified 

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---
rollback tolerance (distance, optional velocity) shall result in the CBTC system initiating an emergency brake 

--- Document Chunk 1212 ---
application. Rollback detection criteria for typical CBTC systems are included in Annex C.

--- Document Chunk 1221 ---
prevent trains from over-traveling the end-of-track or, if buffers are specified, to prevent trains from exceeding 

--- Document Chunk 1222 ---
the design limits for impact with an end-of-track buffer. End-of-track protection design shall be based on the 

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
safe braking model of 6.1.2.1.

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
6.1.6 Parted train protection and coupling and uncoupling of trains

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
Where separate vehicles can be coupled together in a consist of two or more vehicles or units to form a train, a 

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
CBTC system shall have the capability of detecting and protecting parted trains. Parted train protection shall 

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
be required regardless of whether the individual vehicles or units are considered to be permanently coupled or 

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
whether they are routinely uncoupled for maintenance or operational purposes.

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
A CBTC system shall also support operating requirements for coupling and uncoupling of trains, including 

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
automatic update of the consist length within the CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may assume a fixed, worst-case, maximum 

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
train length for a given class of trains operating in CBTC territory, with a reliance on operating procedures to 

--- Document Chunk 1233 ---
ensure this maximum train length is not exceeded.

--- Document Chunk 1234 ---

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
6.1.8.1 Door opening control protection interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
If trains are operated with crews, door open control protection interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the 

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
option of the authority having jurisdiction. For operation of trains without crews, door open control protection 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
interlocks shall be mandatory. These interlocks, if provided, shall be such that the following conditions are 

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
satisfied prior to enabling the opening of the train doors (and platform doors, if fitted):

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
a) The train is “properly aligned” at a designated stopping point, where the designated stopping point and

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
Automatic response to an uncommanded train door opening event may be a required ATP function, at the 

--- Document Chunk 1263 ---
option of the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1264 ---
This function, if provided, shall continuously monitor the closed and locked status of all passenger doors on 

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
each car of the train and shall provide a safe reaction if at any time it cannot be confirmed that all passenger 

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---
doors are closed and locked when they are being commanded closed.

--- Document Chunk 1267 ---
The safe reaction to be taken by the CBTC system upon detection of an uncommanded train door opening

6.1.9 Platform Interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1270 ---
6.1.9.1 Departure Interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
If trains are operated with crews, departure interlocks may be a required ATP function, at the option of the 

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
For operation of trains without crews, departure interlocks shall be mandatory.

--- Document Chunk 1274 ---
These interlocks, where required, shall prevent a stationary train from moving (e.g., by disabling the propulsion 

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
system and apply brakes) unless all train doors (and platform edge doors, if fitted) are properly closed and 

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
locked, in accordance with the requirements of 5.14 of IEEE Std 1475-2012.

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
If a platform edge door to train door intrusion system is provided for a gap between train and platform edge 

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
door, in the event of intrusion detected, the CBTC system shall prevent train from departing.

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the 

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
preceding departure interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

--- Document Chunk 1281 ---
6.1.9.2 Arrival Interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
For operation of trains without crews, arrival interlocks shall be mandatory.

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
These interlocks, where required shall function as follows:

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
a) If platform edge doors are not closed and locked, train movement into station shall be prevented.

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
b) If an intrusion system is provided, in the event of intrusion detected, the CBTC system shall prevent 

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
train from entering station.

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
c) If specified by the authority having jurisdiction, facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass 

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
of the preceding arrival interlocks, for failure recovery purposes.

6.1.10Emergency braking

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
The train’s emergency brake system shall be capable of bringing the train to a stop within the assured stopping 

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
distance determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1. Specific criteria for resetting the emergency brakes 

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
to allow normal operation to resume shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. If conditions (as 

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
determined by ATP) are not correct for train movement, the emergency braking shall remain applied regardless 

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
of any reset signals or actions, except that facilities may be provided for a local manual bypass of the ATP 

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
functions for that train to permit manual train operation for failure recovery purposes. Use of such facilities 

--- Document Chunk 1302 ---
shall require strict adherence to operating procedures to provide for the safety of train movements. If correct 

--- Document Chunk 1303 ---
ATP conditions exist after the emergency brakes have been reset, the train shall be permitted to move or 

--- Document Chunk 1304 ---
continue to move; however, if the actual train speed again exceeds the ATP profile speed or a subsequent 

--- Document Chunk 1305 ---
malfunction occurs, emergency braking shall be applied as before.

--- Document Chunk 1306 ---
6.1.11 Route interlocking

--- Document Chunk 1307 ---
A CBTC system shall provide route interlocking functions equivalent to conventional interlocking practice 

--- Document Chunk 1308 ---
to prevent train collisions and derailments. These functions shall include locking of the route in advance of 

--- Document Chunk 1309 ---
the train entering the interlocking (time or approach locking) and once the train is in the interlocking (route 

--- Document Chunk 1310 ---
locking). The switches shall also be locked when the track section containing the switch is occupied by a 

--- Document Chunk 1311 ---
train (detector locking). Locking functions shall also apply to moveable bridges and similar right-of-way 

--- Document Chunk 1312 ---
apparatus. Sectional release (of routes behind a train) may be provided where specified by the authority having 

--- Document Chunk 1313 ---
jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1314 ---
NOTE—The AREMA Communications and Signals Manual, Sections 2 and 16 [B1], provides examples of recommended 

--- Document Chunk 1315 ---
practices for use in interlocking design.

--- Document Chunk 1316 ---
A movement authority shall not be advanced into an interlocking until the appropriate route is set and locked. 

--- Document Chunk 1317 ---
Once a movement authority has been advanced through an interlocking, the affected route shall not be 

--- Document Chunk 1318 ---
released, and conflicting routes cleared unless either the train has traveled through and is verified clear of the 

--- Document Chunk 1319 ---
interlocking or the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect.

--- Document Chunk 1320 ---
When specified by the authority having jurisdiction, interlocking functions may be provided by separate 

--- Document Chunk 1321 ---
interlocking equipment, which is based on train position established by a secondary train detection subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 1322 ---
In this case, a CBTC system shall interface to and may modify the conventional interlocking functions based 

--- Document Chunk 1323 ---
on train position established by the CBTC train location determination function, to safely enable the enhanced 

--- Document Chunk 1324 ---
performance capabilities of a CBTC system to be realized.

--- Document Chunk 1325 ---
6.1.11.1 CBTC interfaces to a separate interlocking

--- Document Chunk 1326 ---
If a separate interlocking is specified, a CBTC system shall interface to interlockings as follows:

--- Document Chunk 1327 ---
a) Time or approach locking shall apply, except in the event of a route being canceled for an approaching 

--- Document Chunk 1328 ---
CBTC train (i.e., the movement authority is pulled back short of the interlocking and is in effect). In 

--- Document Chunk 1329 ---
this case, if the train is greater than a safe braking distance from the entrance to the interlocking (as 

--- Document Chunk 1330 ---
determined by the safe braking model of 6.1.2.1) or the train stops prior to entering the interlocking, 

--- Document Chunk 1331 ---
the route shall be released without running further time.

--- Document Chunk 1332 ---
b) Traffic locking may be overridden so that CBTC-equipped trains may move in opposing directions 

--- Document Chunk 1333 ---
within their respective movement authorities on the same track at the same time.

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
c) Wayside signals and their aspects may be provided as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. A 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
CBTC system may override the conventional aspects to cause the signal(s) to display CBTC aspect(s) 

--- Document Chunk 1336 ---
only to CBTC-equipped trains.

6.1.11.2 Responses to CBTC train location failures

--- Document Chunk 1342 ---
In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function, route locking shall remain in effect 

--- Document Chunk 1343 ---
until the train is proven to be clear of the interlocking by the CBTC system (i.e., the train is subsequently 

--- Document Chunk 1344 ---
determined to be clear of the interlocking limits), or through operating procedures, or a combination of both 

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
approaches.

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
In the event of a failure of the CBTC train location determination function in an interlocking where train 

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
location is also capable of being detected by means of a secondary system, CBTC system overrides of the 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
interlocking functions may be released, provided route and other locking functions are maintained by a 

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
separate interlocking system so as to prevent the movement of a switch in front of and under the train until the 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
train is proven to be clear of the interlocking.

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
6.1.11.3 Response to loss of switch indication

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
In the event of a loss of switch indication once a movement authority has been issued across a switch, a CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
system shall pull back the movement authority to a point prior to the switch.

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
6.1.12 Travel direction reversal interlocks

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
Travel direction reversal interlocks shall be a required ATP function for any CBTC system application 

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
requiring bidirectional operations, in order to support reversal of train direction at terminal stations and to 

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
support intermediate turn backs and shuttle modes of operation, for example.

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
It shall not be possible to extend the movement authority for a train into a section of track for which an opposing 

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
authorized travel direction has already been established.

--- Document Chunk 1360 ---
A reversal of authorized travel direction within a section of track shall not be possible unless both of the 

--- Document Chunk 1361 ---
following are true:

--- Document Chunk 1362 ---
a) All trains within that section of track are at zero speed and constrained against motion in the original 

--- Document Chunk 1363 ---
authorized travel direction.

--- Document Chunk 1364 ---
b) The movement authorities for all trains outside of that section of track do not extend into the section 

--- Document Chunk 1365 ---
and are constrained from being extended into the section in the original authorized travel direction.

--- Document Chunk 1366 ---
6.1.13 Work zone protection

--- Document Chunk 1367 ---
A CBTC system shall not grant movement authorities to trains to operate into out-of-service (blocked) tracks 

--- Document Chunk 1368 ---
or through switches blocked in other than the required position and shall enforce restricted speeds on approach 

--- Document Chunk 1369 ---
to and through defined work zones (see 6.3.6.4). A CBTC system may also include capabilities to preclude 

--- Document Chunk 1370 ---
ATO mode of operation through a work zone.

--- Document Chunk 1371 ---
6.1.14 Broken rail detection

--- Document Chunk 1372 ---
Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to an external system for 

--- Document Chunk 1373 ---
purposes of broken rail detection. A CBTC system’s reaction to a detected broken rail shall be as specified by 

--- Document Chunk 1374 ---
the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1375 ---
6.1.15 Highway grade-crossing warning

--- Document Chunk 1376 ---
Where highway crossings at grade exist within the limits of CBTC territory and where specified by the authority 

--- Document Chunk 1377 ---
having jurisdiction, a CBTC system may interface to grade-crossing warning devices to permit control of such 

--- Document Chunk 1378 ---
devices based on CBTC location reports and to coordinate movement authorities through the crossing based 

--- Document Chunk 1379 ---

--- Document Chunk 1384 ---
be further defined by the authority having jurisdiction and may include any of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1385 ---
a) Constant (and consistent) warning times, independent of train speed or acceleration/deceleration

--- Document Chunk 1386 ---
b) For trains making station stops prior to crossings, delayed activation of the warning devices until the 

--- Document Chunk 1387 ---
train is ready to depart the station

--- Document Chunk 1388 ---
c) An external subsystem providing status of grade crossing may modify CBTC operation, such as 

--- Document Chunk 1389 ---
movement authority limit

--- Document Chunk 1390 ---
d) When a train clears a crossing in multiple track areas, continued activation of the warning devices if 

--- Document Chunk 1391 ---
the CBTC system predicts a second train will reactivate the devices within a predefined time interval

--- Document Chunk 1392 ---
e) Advance warning for priority control of highway traffic signals or other highway signage, (e.g., as 

--- Document Chunk 1393 ---
described in IEEE Std 1570-2002)

--- Document Chunk 1394 ---
6.1.16 Restricted route protections

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
Where specified by the authority having jurisdiction, a CBTC system shall include capabilities to prevent a 

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
train from entering a route that is unsafe for movement of that type of train due to mechanical, civil, electrical, 

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
or other predefined temporary or permanent conditions of the train or route, or through interfaces to intrusion 

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
detection devices, platform edge doors (where fitted), and/or other devices capable of detecting hazards that 

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
impact route integrity.

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
6.2 ATO functions

--- Document Chunk 1401 ---
For operation of trains without crews, a CBTC system shall, as a minimum, be capable of providing all of the 

--- Document Chunk 1402 ---
ATO functions as defined in this sub clause, to automatically operate trains in accordance with prescribed 

--- Document Chunk 1403 ---
operating criteria within the safety constraints imposed by ATP.

6.2.1 Automatic speed regulation

--- Document Chunk 1409 ---
The starting, stopping, and speed regulation of the train as it travels along the track shall be automatically 

--- Document Chunk 1410 ---
controlled by a CBTC system so that the speed, acceleration, deceleration, and jerk rates are within specified 

--- Document Chunk 1411 ---
passenger comfort limits (as defined by the authority having jurisdiction) and the train speed is below the 

--- Document Chunk 1412 ---
overspeed limits imposed by ATP.

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
Station stopping accuracy shall be as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
A CBTC system may support multiple ATO speeds, acceleration, and service brake rates in accordance with 

--- Document Chunk 1415 ---
the train operator (if present) or ATS inputs.

--- Document Chunk 1416 ---
6.2.2 Platform berthing control

--- Document Chunk 1417 ---
A CBTC system shall be capable of implementing any of the following platform berthing control modes:

--- Document Chunk 1418 ---
a) Where the platform length is approximately equal to the train length, a CBTC system shall allow a 

--- Document Chunk 1419 ---
train to enter a station platform only if there is sufficient room to fully berth or if the preceding train 

--- Document Chunk 1420 ---
has a movement authority that shall allow it to fully leave the platform area and it has begun to move 

--- Document Chunk 1421 ---
out of the station (i.e., within ATP constraints, train movement shall be controlled to minimize the

such that the train and matching platform edge doors open and close together. It shall be possible to manually 

--- Document Chunk 1443 ---
disable the operation of any door set (both the train and the matching platform edge door) without affecting 

--- Document Chunk 1444 ---
the automatic operation of other door sets. If a train door is disabled, the corresponding platform edge door

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
an ATS system. Under such circumstances, and to the extent specified by the authority having jurisdiction, 

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
CBTC- related ATS functions shall be implemented as defined in this sub clause in order to benefit from the 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
characteristics of a CBTC system as defined in 4.1, namely, the availability of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
a) Train location information to a high precision, independent of track circuits

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
b) Continuous wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data communications link

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
c) Train-borne and wayside data processing capabilities

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
The CBTC-related ATS functions defined in this sub clause shall be fully integrated with other conventional 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
ATS functions and other non-ATS functions, as may be specified by the authority having jurisdiction, to 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
support overall service management for the transit system and provide for a single consistent user interface.

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
The CBTC data communications network, inclusive of the wayside-to-train and train-to-wayside data 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---
communications interface, shall be sufficient to support those CBTC-related ATS functions specified by the 

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
6.3.1 ATS user interface

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
Each ATS user interface shall display all information and implement all control actions, as defined in 6.3, 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
within acceptable latencies as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
Mandatory display data and user information inputs shall be in accordance with IEEE Std 1474.2-2025. The 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
ATS user shall be able to override any automated CBTC-related ATS functions defined in 6.3.

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
Certain ATS functions (such as stopping a train en route and the application and removal of temporary speed 

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
restrictions, switch/track blocking, or work zones) can potentially introduce system hazards and the specific 

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
implementation of these functions shall be considered in the hazard analyses required by 5.3.2. ATS functions 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
are not required to be implemented in a fail-safe manner; however, the hazard analyses shall take into account, 

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
as a minimum, the probability of the following:

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
a) Safety-related commands not being executed when initiated by an ATS user,

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
b) The CBTC system prematurely removing safety-related commands initiated by an ATS user,

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
c) The CBTC system executing safety-related commands that were not initiated by an ATS user,

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
d) Incorrect information being displayed by the CBTC system to the ATS user.

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
The hazard analyses shall give due consideration of the specific transit application and whether the trains are 

--- Document Chunk 1511 ---
operated with or without crews.

--- Document Chunk 1512 ---
Control action confirmation (e.g., separate acknowledgment) shall be provided for any safety-related user 

--- Document Chunk 1513 ---
interfaces/inputs and functions whose inadvertent implementation could have an adverse operational impact 

--- Document Chunk 1514 ---
(e.g., removal of work zones, removal of speed restrictions), as defined by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1515 ---
Control action commands may be implemented in a closed loop manner that requires a request and 

--- Document Chunk 1516 ---
acknowledgment between ATS and CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 1517 ---
6.3.2 CBTC train identification and train tracking

--- Document Chunk 1518 ---
Each CBTC-equipped train operating within CBTC territory shall be assigned a train identification. This train 

--- Document Chunk 1519 ---
identification shall indicate the type of train and other pertinent information about the train.

--- Document Chunk 1520 ---
An ATS system shall have the capability to automatically track, maintain records of, and display on the ATS 

--- Document Chunk 1521 ---
user interface the locations, identities, train schedule, and other pertinent data for all CBTC-equipped trains 

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
operating in the CBTC territory. The front and rear position of trains shall be tracked based on CBTC train 

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
location reports, and the train location shall be displayed on the ATS user interface. Variations in train length 

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
may be displayed either proportionally or as a standard-length icon supplemented by textual train length data.

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---
The ATS systems may also have provisions to display non-CBTC or non-communicating trains.

--- Document Chunk 1528 ---
manually and automatically routed based on CBTC train location reports and in accordance with the train 

--- Document Chunk 1529 ---
service data, predefined routing rules, and any ATS user-directed service strategy. Where applicable to the 

--- Document Chunk 1530 ---
specific track configuration, automatic routing shall facilitate the proper merging and diverging of trains 

--- Document Chunk 1531 ---
at junctions, turn back of trains, the movement of trains from/to storage areas, and the rerouting of trains 

--- Document Chunk 1532 ---
in response to service disruptions and/or planned outages. Train routes shall be indicated on the ATS user 

--- Document Chunk 1533 ---
interface and may also be indicated to the train operator and/or conductor, if present, on their displays, as 

--- Document Chunk 1534 ---
specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1535 ---
An ATS system may also include a means to control and limit movement authorities of CBTC-equipped trains 

--- Document Chunk 1536 ---
operating in CBTC territory. CBTC movement authority limits shall be capable of being displayed on the ATS 

--- Document Chunk 1537 ---
user interface, and any uncommanded reductions of authority limits shall be alarmed.

--- Document Chunk 1538 ---
For trains operated with crews, movement authority limits may also be indicated to the train operator and/or 

--- Document Chunk 1539 ---
conductor on their displays, as specified by the authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1540 ---
6.3.4 Automatic train regulation

--- Document Chunk 1541 ---
6.3.4.1 Schedule/headway regulation

--- Document Chunk 1542 ---
An ATS system may have the capability to automatically monitor and regulate the performance of CBTC- 

--- Document Chunk 1543 ---
equipped trains operating in CBTC territory, in relation to schedule and/or headway adherence.

--- Document Chunk 1544 ---
An ATS system may include an automatic dispatching function (based on train identities, schedules, CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1545 ---
train location reports, scheduled and actual headways between trains, and service strategies implemented by 

--- Document Chunk 1546 ---
authorized ATS users).

--- Document Chunk 1547 ---
Schedule and headway regulation for CBTC-equipped trains shall be by means of dwell time variance 

--- Document Chunk 1548 ---
(including train holds) and may also be by control of run times between stations (e.g., through adjustments to 

--- Document Chunk 1549 ---
train acceleration and service brake rates, and speeds), as specified by the authority having jurisdiction. For 

--- Document Chunk 1550 ---
trains operated with crews, the desired station departure time, dwell time, and desired speed profile between

--- Document Chunk 1555 ---
stations may be indicated to the train operator and/or conductor on their displays, and, when operating in ATO 

--- Document Chunk 1556 ---
mode, shall be implemented automatically by a CBTC system using the automatic speed regulation function 

--- Document Chunk 1557 ---
of 6.2.1 and may include dwell time adjustment.

--- Document Chunk 1558 ---
An ATS system may provide the capability to adjust the train service braking profiles and tractive effort for 

--- Document Chunk 1559 ---
CBTC-equipped trains (e.g., in response to climatic (e.g., wet rail conditions). A CBTC system shall coordinate 

--- Document Chunk 1560 ---
implementation of requested changes in service braking profiles to avoid conditions that would result in an 

--- Document Chunk 1561 ---
emergency brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1562 ---
6.3.4.2 Junction management

--- Document Chunk 1563 ---
An ATS system may include automatic train regulation functions, based on CBTC train location reports, to 

--- Document Chunk 1564 ---
facilitate appropriate train meets (such as transfers between local and express tracks, and at the merge point 

--- Document Chunk 1565 ---
between different lines) in order to optimize overall system operational performance.

--- Document Chunk 1566 ---
6.3.4.3 Energy optimization

--- Document Chunk 1567 ---
An ATS system may have the capability to implement energy optimization algorithms for CBTC-equipped 

--- Document Chunk 1568 ---
trains through the real-time control and coordination of train acceleration, train coasting, and train braking. 

--- Document Chunk 1569 ---
The priority given to energy optimization versus schedule/headway regulation shall be as specified by the 

--- Document Chunk 1570 ---
authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1571 ---
6.3.5 Station stop functions

--- Document Chunk 1572 ---

--- Document Chunk 1573 ---
An ATS system may include the means to direct a single CBTC-equipped train or a group of CBTC-equipped 

--- Document Chunk 1574 ---
trains to stop at the next station, even if the train is scheduled to bypass that station. For trains operated with 

--- Document Chunk 1575 ---
crews, a CBTC system may indicate the ATS train stop information to the train operator and conductor on their 

--- Document Chunk 1576 ---
displays. In ATO mode, a CBTC-equipped train shall automatically stop at the next station.

--- Document Chunk 1577 ---
6.3.5.2 Hold train at station

--- Document Chunk 1578 ---
For trains operated without crews, an ATS system shall include facilities to hold (and subsequently release) a 

--- Document Chunk 1579 ---
CBTC-equipped train at a station.

--- Document Chunk 1580 ---
For trains operated with crews, this function is optional and shall be as specified by the authority having 

--- Document Chunk 1581 ---
jurisdiction. If this function is provided, a CBTC system may indicate the train hold information to the train 

--- Document Chunk 1582 ---
operator and conductor on their displays, and/or prevent a CBTC-equipped train from departing the station in 

--- Document Chunk 1583 ---
ATO mode.

--- Document Chunk 1584 ---
6.3.5.3 Skip station stop

--- Document Chunk 1585 ---
An ATS system may include facilities to direct a CBTC-equipped train or group of CBTC-equipped trains to 

--- Document Chunk 1586 ---
pass through a station or group of stations without stopping. For trains operated with crews, a CBTC system 

--- Document Chunk 1587 ---
may indicate the skip station information to the train operator and conductor on their displays. In ATO mode, 

--- Document Chunk 1588 ---
the train shall automatically skip the designated stations at a speed not exceeding speed as defined by authority 

--- Document Chunk 1589 ---
having jurisdiction. Skip station stop command may inhibit automatic door opening if train happens to stop at 

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
platform (e.g., per movement authority).

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
6.3.5.4 Door control inhibit

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
An ATS system may include facilities to inhibit (and subsequently permit) CBTC control of the train doors, in 

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
accordance with 6.2.3.

6.3.6 Restricting train operations

--- Document Chunk 1599 ---
The application and removal of the following restrictive functions can potentially introduce system hazards 

--- Document Chunk 1600 ---
and the specific implementation of these functions shall be in accordance with 6.3.2 and considered in the 

--- Document Chunk 1601 ---
hazard analyses required by 5.3.2. Stacked (multiple) safety related or restrictive commands shall be removed 

--- Document Chunk 1602 ---
one at a time in accordance with 6.3.2 so that no unintended permissive state is allowed.

--- Document Chunk 1603 ---
6.3.6.1 Stopping a train enroute

--- Document Chunk 1604 ---
An ATS system shall provide a means to stop a single CBTC-equipped train or group of CBTC-equipped trains 

--- Document Chunk 1605 ---
immediately. A CBTC system shall initiate an immediate brake application on the designated trains and notify 

--- Document Chunk 1606 ---
the train operator and conductor, if present, via their displays. Removal of the ATS initiated stop command 

--- Document Chunk 1607 ---
may be accomplished on a train by train basis for all CBTC-equipped trains.

--- Document Chunk 1608 ---
6.3.6.2 Temporary speed restrictions

--- Document Chunk 1609 ---
An ATS system shall include facilities to impose (and remove) temporary speed restrictions for CBTC- 

--- Document Chunk 1610 ---
equipped trains operating on any section of track in CBTC territory (see 6.1.3).

--- Document Chunk 1611 ---
6.3.6.3 Switch/track blocking

--- Document Chunk 1612 ---
An ATS system shall include facilities to block (and subsequently unblock) a switch, a controlled signal, a 

--- Document Chunk 1613 ---
route entry point, or a section of track within CBTC territory. A CBTC system shall prohibit CBTC-equipped 

--- Document Chunk 1614 ---
trains from receiving movement authorities over blocked switches not aligned in the required position or into 

--- Document Chunk 1615 ---
routes and/or sections of track that have been blocked (see 6.1.2 and 6.1.3).

--- Document Chunk 1616 ---
6.3.6.4 Work zones

--- Document Chunk 1617 ---
An ATS system shall include facilities to establish (and subsequently remove) temporary work zones for the 

--- Document Chunk 1618 ---
protection of work crews and work trains.

--- Document Chunk 1619 ---
A CBTC system shall enforce restricted speeds on approach to and through defined work zones (see 6.1.13). A 

--- Document Chunk 1620 ---
CBTC systems may also enforce restricted speed on adjacent track through defined work zone as determined 

--- Document Chunk 1621 ---
by authority having jurisdiction. A CBTC system may also enforce a stop prior to entering work zone. For 

--- Document Chunk 1622 ---
trains operated with crews, information indicating that the restriction is due to a work zone shall be displayed 

--- Document Chunk 1623 ---
to the train operator and conductor on their displays, and the CBTC system may preclude ATO mode of 

--- Document Chunk 1624 ---
operation through a work zone.

--- Document Chunk 1625 ---
If the authority having jurisdiction allows roadway workers during train operations, the ATS/CBTC system 

--- Document Chunk 1626 ---
may provide methods of visually and audibly indicating the approach of trains along the wayside to warn on-

--- Document Chunk 1627 ---
track roadway workers.

--- Document Chunk 1628 ---
6.3.6.5 Climatic conditions

--- Document Chunk 1629 ---
If a Climatic condition is a function of the service brake calculations, removal of such restriction shall be done 

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
in accordance with 6.3.2.

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
6.3.7 Passenger information system interfaces

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
An ATS system may interface with wayside and/or train-borne passenger information systems to trigger 

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
automatic passenger information messages, such as train arrival information, based on CBTC train location 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
reports. Train-borne passenger information system interfaces shall be in accordance with IEEE Std 1477- 1998.

Failures and out-of-tolerance conditions detected by, or input to, a CBTC system that can impact the on-

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
time performance of the transit system or result in some other loss of specific CBTC functionality may be 

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
automatically indicated on the ATS user interface display. Any alarms shall be categorized and prioritized into 

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
critical and noncritical alarms and logged. All critical alarms, as defined by authority having jurisdiction shall 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
require acknowledgment.

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
6.3.8.2 Train fault reporting

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
Train-borne CBTC equipment may include interfaces to train-borne subsystems for the purposes of

6.3.8.3 CBTC data logging

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
CBTC system shall log all communication between all CBTC sub systems in all modes of operation and store 

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
in accordance with requirements as defined by authority having jurisdiction.

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
CBTC logged data shall be available for playback analysis and incident investigation and to aid in trouble 

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
shooting. This data may also be available for external data analysis by 3rd party tools.

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
6.4 Interoperability interface requirements

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
This performance and functional requirements standard does not include interface design standards for 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
interoperability. Where interoperability requirements are specified by the authority having jurisdiction, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
be the responsibility of that authority to define the required interoperability interface standards.

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
NOTE—Examples of interoperability requirements include the following:

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
a) Trains equipped with CBTC equipment furnished by one supplier to be capable of operating in CBTC territory 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
equipped with wayside CBTC equipment furnished by another supplier

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
b) Wayside equipment furnished by two separate suppliers to communicate with each other in the overlap area and 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
with common central ATS equipment

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
c) A basic operating unit with train-borne CBTC equipment furnished by one supplier to be capable of operating 

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
within a train with another basic operating unit equipped with train-borne CBTC equipment furnished by another 

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
supplier

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
A future CBTC standard may establish interoperability interface requirements.

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
Typical safe braking model

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
D.1 Introduction

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
A typical safe braking model for CBTC systems is illustrated in Figure D.1.

--- Document Chunk 1744 ---
See IEEE 1698-2009 for additional information. [B2]

--- Document Chunk 1745 ---
It should be noted that Figure D.1 is not drawn to scale but is a simplistic representation to assist in the 

--- Document Chunk 1746 ---
understanding of a typical CBTC safe braking model. It should also be noted that the safe braking model 

--- Document Chunk 1747 ---
outlined here is defined for level tangent track and would need to be adjusted for grades. The safe braking 

--- Document Chunk 1748 ---
parameters may be different depending on covered versus uncovered track.

--- Document Chunk 1749 ---
In Figure D.1, the emergency brake curve  is the worst-case, open-loop, speed/distance curve a train will 

--- Document Chunk 1750 ---
follow once the ATP has initiated an emergency brake application. This emergency brake curve is always less 

--- Document Chunk 1751 ---
than or equal to the safe speed curve, where safe speed is defined as the speed above which a critical hazard 

--- Document Chunk 1752 ---
(derailment or collision) could occur.

--- Document Chunk 1753 ---
In this model, safety factors are accounted for in the emergency brake curve, train position uncertainties, and 

--- Document Chunk 1754 ---
other additional measurement tolerances incorporated in the CBTC system design, and there is no requirement 

--- Document Chunk 1755 ---
to add additional safety margins.

--- Document Chunk 1756 ---
The ATP overspeed detection curve is the speed-distance curve that the ATP subsystem uses to immediately 

--- Document Chunk 1757 ---
initiate an emergency brake application, if the ATP subsystem detects that the measured speed exceeds this 

--- Document Chunk 1758 ---
curve at the measured train location. When the ATP subsystem has initiated an emergency brake application, 

--- Document Chunk 1759 ---
the ATP subsystem is no longer in the control loop, and the train will emergency brake at or below the 

--- Document Chunk 1760 ---
emergency brake curve. The emergency brake curve includes an initial propulsion runaway period, until 

--- Document Chunk 1761 ---
propulsion is disabled.

--- Document Chunk 1762 ---
The ATP profile curve is the speed-distance curve that is an ATP overspeed allowance below the ATP over- 

--- Document Chunk 1763 ---
speed detection curve. The ATP profile is the base curve used by the ATP subsystem.

--- Document Chunk 1764 ---
D.2 Train-borne CBTC response time (A)

--- Document Chunk 1765 ---
In Figure D.1, it is assumed that the CBTC system will measure the train speed and train location (relative to 

--- Document Chunk 1766 ---
its movement authority limit) and compare the measured speed with the ATP profile speed at that measured 

--- Document Chunk 1767 ---
location, every A seconds (worst case).

--- Document Chunk 1768 ---
In Figure D.1, point X represents the situation where the CBTC measured speed is just below the ATP over- 

--- Document Chunk 1769 ---
speed detection curve at the ATP measured location, i.e., although the ATP measured speed is above the ATP 

--- Document Chunk 1770 ---
profile, it is still within the ATP overspeed allowance. As such, the CBTC system will not initiate emergency 

--- Document Chunk 1771 ---
braking.

--- Document Chunk 1772 ---
However, because of worst-case speed and location measurement errors (position uncertainty), it is possible 

--- Document Chunk 1773 ---
that the actual speed and actual location of the train could be a point Y .

--- Document Chunk 1774 ---
At this point in time, although the train operator and/or ATO subsystem would normally be attempting to 

--- Document Chunk 1775 ---
bring the train speed down to the ATP profile speed, it is assumed that a failure occurs that results in the train 

--- Document Chunk 1776 ---
accelerating rather than braking.

--- Document Chunk 1781 ---
A seconds later, this situation will be detected by the CBTC system (point Z in Figure D.1), as the CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1782 ---
measured speed will now clearly be in excess of the ATP overspeed detection curve, and the CBTC system will 

--- Document Chunk 1783 ---
immediately initiate an open-loop emergency brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1784 ---
The speed at point Z therefore represents the maximum speed that a train can achieve above the ATP profile 

--- Document Chunk 1785 ---
due to CBTC system’s worst-case response times and measurement errors.

--- Document Chunk 1786 ---
At this point, the remaining contributions to the safe braking model are determined by the vehicle characteristics 

--- Document Chunk 1787 ---
only.

--- Document Chunk 1788 ---
D.3 Propulsion disable response time (B)

--- Document Chunk 1789 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled B in Figure D.1), the train continues to accelerate 

--- Document Chunk 1790 ---
until the train propulsion system has been disabled in response to the CBTC system initiating an emergency 

--- Document Chunk 1791 ---
brake application.

--- Document Chunk 1792 ---
D.4 Coast time (C)

--- Document Chunk 1793 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled C in Figure D.1), the train is assumed to be coasting 

--- Document Chunk 1794 ---
at the maximum speed achieved as a result of the train accelerating prior to propulsion being disabled. This 

--- Document Chunk 1795 ---
component of the safe braking model ends when emergency braking begins to take effect.

--- Document Chunk 1796 ---
D.5 Emergency brake build-up time (D)

--- Document Chunk 1797 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled D in Figure D.1), the emergency brake rate will 

--- Document Chunk 1798 ---
build up from zero to at least the GEBR.

--- Document Chunk 1799 ---
D.6 Emergency braking at GEBR (E)

--- Document Chunk 1800 ---
During this component of the safe braking model (labeled E in Figure D.1), the train continues to decelerate at 

--- Document Chunk 1801 ---
the GEBR until the train comes to zero speed.

--- Document Chunk 1802 ---
NOTE—The components D and E may be integrated into an equivalent single brake curve.

--- Document Chunk 1803 ---
D.7 Position uncertainty

--- Document Chunk 1804 ---
The safe braking model shall include the maximum distance due to measurement inaccuracy by the CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 1805 ---
system for both the leading and following train.

hazard controls and follow-on actions.

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
E.2.2 Description

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
A PHA shall be performed and documented to obtain an initial risk assessment of a concept or system. Based 

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---
on the best available data, including mishap data (if assessable) from similar systems and other les- sons 

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
learned, hazards associated with the proposed design or function shall be evaluated for hazard severity, hazard 

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
probability, and operational constraint. Safety provisions and alternatives needed to eliminate hazards or 

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
reduce their associated risk to a level acceptable to the authority having jurisdiction shall be included. The 

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
PHA shall consider the following for identification and evaluation of hazards, as a minimum:

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---

b) Safety-related interface considerations among various elements of the system (e.g., material 

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
compatibilities, electromagnetic interference, inadvertent activation, fire/explosive initiation and 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
propagation, and hardware and software controls). This shall include consideration of the potential 

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
contribution by software (including software developed by other contractors/sources) to subsystem/ 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
system mishaps. Safety design criteria to control safety-critical software commands and responses

(e.g., inadvertent command, failure to command, untimely command or responses, inappropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
magnitude, or other designated undesired events) shall be identified and appropriate action taken to 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
incorporate them in the software (and related hardware) specifications.

c) Environmental constraints, including the operating environments (e.g., drop, shock, vibration, 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
extreme temperatures, noise, exposure to toxic substances, health hazards, fire, electrostatic discharge, 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
lightning, electromagnetic environmental effects).

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
d) Operating, test, maintenance, built-in-tests, diagnostics, and emergency procedures (e.g., human 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
factors engineering, human error analysis of operator functions, tasks, and requirements; effect of 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
factors, such as equipment layout, lighting requirements, potential exposures to toxic materials; 

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---
effects of noise or radiation on human performance). Those test-unique hazards that will be a direct 

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
result of the test and evaluation of the article or vehicle.

--- Document Chunk 1977 ---
training (e.g., training and certification pertaining to safety operations and maintenance).

--- Document Chunk 1978 ---
f) Safety-related equipment, safeguards, and possible alternate approaches (e.g., interlocks; system 

--- Document Chunk 1979 ---
redundancy; fail-safe design considerations using hardware or software controls; subsystem 

--- Document Chunk 1980 ---
protection; fire detection and suppression systems; personal protective equipment; heating, ventilation, 

--- Document Chunk 1981 ---
and air-conditioning; and noise or radiation barriers).

software test programs.

--- Document Chunk 2019 ---
g) That system level hazards attributed to the subsystem are analyzed and that adequate control of the 

--- Document Chunk 2020 ---
potential hazard is implemented in the design.

--- Document Chunk 2021 ---
When software to be used in conjunction with the subsystem is being developed, the contractor performing the 

--- Document Chunk 2022 ---
SSHA shall monitor, obtain, and use the output of each phase of the formal software development process in 

--- Document Chunk 2023 ---
evaluating the software contribution to the SSHA.

--- Document Chunk 2024 ---
The SSHA shall be updated as a result of any system design changes, including software design changes, that

E.5 Operating and support hazard analysis (O&SHA)

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
E.5.1 Purpose

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
The operating and support hazard analysis (O&SHA) shall evaluate activities for hazards or risks introduced 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
into the system by operational and support procedures and evaluate adequacy of operational and support 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
procedures used to eliminate, control, or abate identified hazards or risks.

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
E.5.2 Description

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
An O&SHA shall be performed and documented to examine procedurally controlled activities. The O&SHA 

--- Document Chunk 2079 ---
identifies and evaluates hazards resulting from the following:

--- Document Chunk 2080 ---
— The implementation of operations or tasks performed by persons, considering the planned system 

--- Document Chunk 2081 ---
configuration/state at each phase of activity

--- Document Chunk 2082 ---
— The facility interfaces; the planned environments (or ranges thereof)

--- Document Chunk 2083 ---
— The supporting tools or other equipment, including software controlled automatic test equipment, 

--- Document Chunk 2084 ---
specified for use; operational/task sequence, concurrent task effects and limitations

--- Document Chunk 2085 ---
— The potential for unplanned events, including hazards introduced by human errors

--- Document Chunk 2086 ---
The human shall be considered an element of the total system, receiving both inputs and initiating outputs 

--- Document Chunk 2087 ---
during the conduct of this analysis. The O&SHA shall identify the safety requirements (or alternatives) needed 

--- Document Chunk 2088 ---
to eliminate or control identified hazards or to reduce the associated risk to a level that is acceptable under 

--- Document Chunk 2089 ---
either regulatory or contractually specified criteria.

--- Document Chunk 2090 ---
The analysis shall identify the following:

--- Document Chunk 2091 ---
a) Activities that occur under hazardous conditions, their time periods, and the actions required to 

--- Document Chunk 2092 ---
mitigate risk during these activities/time periods

--- Document Chunk 2093 ---
b) Changes needed in functional or design requirements for system hardware/software, facilities, tooling, 

--- Document Chunk 2094 ---
or support/test equipment to eliminate or control hazards or reduce associated risks

--- Document Chunk 2095 ---
c) Requirements for safety devices and equipment, including personnel safety and life support equipment

--- Document Chunk 2096 ---
d) Warnings, cautions, and special emergency procedures, including those necessitated by failure of a 

--- Document Chunk 2097 ---
computer software-controlled operation, to produce the expected and required safe result or indication

--- Document Chunk 2098 ---
e) Requirements for packaging, handling, storage, transportation, maintenance, and disposal of 

--- Document Chunk 2099 ---
hazardous materials

--- Document Chunk 2100 ---
f) Requirements for safety training and personnel certification

--- Document Chunk 2101 ---
g) Effects of nondevelopmental hardware and software across the interface with other system components 

--- Document Chunk 2102 ---
or subsystems

--- Document Chunk 2103 ---
h) Potentially hazardous system states under operator control

--- Document Chunk 2104 ---
The O&SHA shall document system safety assessment of procedures involved in system production, 

--- Document Chunk 2105 ---
deployment, installation, assembly, test, operation, maintenance, servicing, transportation, storage, 

--- Document Chunk 2106 ---
modification, and disposal.

--- Document Chunk 2107 ---
The contractor shall update the O&SHA as a result of any system design or operational changes.

E.6 Risk assessment

--- Document Chunk 2113 ---
The hazard resolution process shall be initiated by defining the physical and functional characteristics of the 

--- Document Chunk 2114 ---
system to be analyzed. These characteristics shall be presented in terms of the major elements that make up the 

--- Document Chunk 2115 ---
system and its environment, including equipment, facilities, procedures, and people.

--- Document Chunk 2116 ---
The hazards shall be identified. The techniques and methods used to identify the hazards shall include the 

--- Document Chunk 2117 ---
following:

--- Document Chunk 2118 ---
— Data from previous accidents or operating experience

--- Document Chunk 2119 ---
— Expert opinion and hazard scenarios

--- Document Chunk 2120 ---
— Checklists of potential hazards

--- Document Chunk 2121 ---
— Previous hazard analyses

--- Document Chunk 2122 ---
— Other analysis techniques as appropriate

--- Document Chunk 2123 ---
All identified hazards shall be assessed in terms of the severity or consequence of the hazard and the probability 

--- Document Chunk 2124 ---
of occurrence.

--- Document Chunk 2125 ---
Risk assessment estimates (see Table E.1) shall be used as the basis in the decision-making process to determine 

--- Document Chunk 2126 ---
whether individual system or subsystem hazards shall be eliminated, mitigated, or accepted. Hazards shall be 

--- Document Chunk 2127 ---
resolved through a design process that emphasizes the elimination of the hazard. Resolution strategies or 

--- Document Chunk 2128 ---
countermeasures to be employed, listed in order of preference, shall be the following:

--- Document Chunk 2129 ---
a) Design to eliminate hazards

--- Document Chunk 2130 ---
b) Design to control hazards

--- Document Chunk 2131 ---
c) Use safety devices

--- Document Chunk 2132 ---
d) Use warning devices

--- Document Chunk 2133 ---
e) Implement special procedures

--- Document Chunk 2134 ---
f) Accept the hazard

--- Document Chunk 2135 ---
g) Eliminate the subsystem/equipment/requirement

--- Document Chunk 2136 ---
This process shall include full documentation of the hazard resolution activities. The effectiveness of the 

--- Document Chunk 2137 ---
countermeasures shall be monitored to determine that no new hazards are introduced. In addition, whenever 

--- Document Chunk 2138 ---
substantive changes are made to the system, analyses shall be conducted to identify and resolve any new 

--- Document Chunk 2139 ---
hazards.

--- Document Chunk 2140 ---
Table E.1 provides an example of the relationship between risk, severity, and probability as it may be applied 

--- Document Chunk 2141 ---
when assessing CBTC systems. The authority having jurisdiction may choose to modify this table to reflect 

--- Document Chunk 2142 ---
existing procedures or requirements.

Annex F

--- Document Chunk 2207 ---
(informative)

--- Document Chunk 2208 ---
Typical approaches to specifying CBTC system availability

--- Document Chunk 2209 ---
F.1 Traditional equipment-based approach

--- Document Chunk 2210 ---
The traditional approach to defining system availability is the probability that the system is capable of 

--- Document Chunk 2211 ---
operating and performing its intended function at a random point in time, as determined by the system MTBFF 

--- Document Chunk 2212 ---
and MTTRS, as shown in Equation (F.1):

--- Document Chunk 2213 ---
 CBTC system availability =  system MTBFF ⁄  (system MTBFF + system MTTRS)    (F.1)

--- Document Chunk 2214 ---
where system MTTRS is the sum of the system MTTR and the mean travel times for maintenance personnel to 

--- Document Chunk 2215 ---
travel to the site of a failure and meantime to detect failure.

--- Document Chunk 2216 ---
With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:

--- Document Chunk 2217 ---
a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 2218 ---
b) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure

--- Document Chunk 2219 ---
c) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirement

--- Document Chunk 2220 ---
d) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system MTBFF

--- Document Chunk 2221 ---
For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined 

--- Document Chunk 2222 ---
analytically from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs.

--- Document Chunk 2223 ---
Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service system MTBFF 

--- Document Chunk 2224 ---
and MTTRS, with appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of 

--- Document Chunk 2225 ---
the CBTC system.

--- Document Chunk 2226 ---
F.2 Alternative delayed trip-based approach

--- Document Chunk 2227 ---
An alternative approach is to define CBTC system availability in terms of the system’s contributions to the 

--- Document Chunk 2228 ---
desired on-time performance of the transit system, as shown in Equation (F.2):

--- Document Chunk 2229 ---
 CBTC  system  availability = 1   −      

--- Document Chunk 2230 ---
Σ  w  x   Revenue trips delayed more than   t  x    by CBTC Type failure

--- Document Chunk 2231 ---
     ____________________________________________________    Total scheduled revenue trips       (F.2)

--- Document Chunk 2232 ---
where

--- Document Chunk 2233 ---
 Revenue trip  is a scheduled movement of a train, of defined length, from a point of origin to a

--- Document Chunk 2234 ---
   destination, 

--- Document Chunk 2235 ---
  t  x      is a defined delay threshold, 

--- Document Chunk 2236 ---
  w  x      is a weighting factor associated with that delay threshold 

--- Document Chunk 2237 ---
With this approach, CBTC system availability would take into account the delays experienced by passengers. 

--- Document Chunk 2238 ---
As the passenger judges transit system availability on the basis of the wait and travel time variations of the 

--- Document Chunk 2239 ---
service provided, CBTC system failures that result in longer delays are penalized with a greater weighting 

--- Document Chunk 2240 ---
factor than failures that result in shorter delays. In general, delay thresholds would be related to the operating 

--- Document Chunk 2241 ---
headways, as delays at shorter headways impact on-time performance more significantly.

--- Document Chunk 2242 ---

--- Document Chunk 2246 ---
The CBTC system availability requirement may also consider other failure types, to the extent that such failures 

--- Document Chunk 2247 ---
impact fleet availability. For example, even if a train-borne CBTC equipment failure does not immediately 

--- Document Chunk 2248 ---
impact the on-time performance of the transit system, it may subsequently result in missed revenue trips if the 

--- Document Chunk 2249 ---
failure repair time results in the train being unavailable for service.

--- Document Chunk 2250 ---
With this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:

--- Document Chunk 2251 ---
a) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 2252 ---
b) The various delay thresholds and weighting factors

--- Document Chunk 2253 ---
c) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure

--- Document Chunk 2254 ---
d) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirements

--- Document Chunk 2255 ---
e) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system availability

--- Document Chunk 2256 ---
For a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined through 

--- Document Chunk 2257 ---
computer modeling from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs, and an assumed system operating 

--- Document Chunk 2258 ---
plan.

--- Document Chunk 2259 ---
Actual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service delays, with 

--- Document Chunk 2260 ---
appropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of the CBTC system.
