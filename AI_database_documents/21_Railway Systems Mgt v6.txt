1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
A railway is a complex system.  All parts of the system must work well together to deliver safe and 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
efficient outputs.  This means that all sub-systems and their interfaces with each other (and with 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
human operators) need to be carefully designed.  Thinking about this should start at the beginning of 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
any project because once equipment is being installed, or is in use, it is usually impractical or 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
expensive to make changes.   

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
This document outlines some of the principles and tools of systems management and their application 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
to the entire life cycle of assets.

2 Project Life Cycle & Stage Gates 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
2.1 Life Cycle for the Project 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
Good systems do not just happen, they are designed and planned; and they achieve this when 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
their projects follow a disciplined procedure. This is often called a life-cycle and the ‘V’ life-cycle 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
in particular will be discussed in the next section. This will look at the generic steps that a 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
project should go through in order to deliver a well-engineered solution. 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
A typical project breakdown is shown in the figure below.  It divides the whole project process 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
from start to finish into a number of discrete steps or phases 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
Each phase: 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
 Has a defined start point 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
 Can be described in terms of its characteristics 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
 Provides clear boundaries between its neighbouring phases 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
 Defines the transition to the next phase 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
 Has a clearly defined end point 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
2.2 Problem Solution and Definition 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
The problem to be solved should be clearly defined and articulated. The feasibility of the 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
potential solutions should be confirmed. The potential solution(s) to be pursued should 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
be selected on the basis of a systematic assessment and comparison of the proposals. 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
2.3 Requirements Definition 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
2.3.1 There are 2 parts to this: 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
 The business requirements describing the change that is needed.  It is often 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
expressed in performance or monetary terms.  The business sponsor would define 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
these with major input from operators and maintainers. 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
 The system requirements which are a technical response to the business 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
requirements. These describe in clear engineering terms what the system will do. 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
2.3.2 As requirements are captured, there are certain items which the project knows to be true 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
and upon which it relies in order to deliver its solution. There are other items about which 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
it is not certain or is dependent on others to deliver, either as part of the project, or once 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
the solution has been put into service. These are called Domain Knowledge, 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
Assumptions, Dependencies and Caveats which are defined as: 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
 Domain Knowledge: Things known to be true: e.g. characteristics of signalling 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
relays, typical adhesion values for steel wheels on steel rail; 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
 Assumptions are statements made about items outside the scope of the 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
system under consideration, but are relied upon to be true in order for the 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
system to operate as expected. Once the facts are known an assumption will 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
either be deleted, or changed to become domain knowledge, a dependency 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
or a caveat; 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
 A dependency is a requirement for someone or something else to act before 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
a task can be completed, e.g. if a project is delivering new rolling stock, it 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
would be reasonable to depend upon any necessary depot alterations to be 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
made; 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
 Caveats are conditions that must be delivered after a system is put into 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
operation, e.g. for the same rolling stock project a caveat is that the vehicle is 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
maintained to design standards. 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
2.4 Design Development 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
This phase includes all the design activities that need to be carried out before the system can 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
be realised. The phase results in a design baseline – a design set of documents and 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
drawings. The level of detail in the design is very dependent upon the disciplines 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
involved and the contractual strategy adopted. 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
2.5 Implementation/Migration 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
The Implementation phase includes all activities that are involved in realising the design, 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
including all construction works as well as the integration of electronic and mechanical 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
subsystems and delivering software and data. The output will be a physical system 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
baseline and as-built documentation. Technical requirements need to be communicated 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
to detailed designers and manufacturers in the form of engineering specifications and 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
technical standards. 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
2.6 Verification, Validation and Testing 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
2.6.1 Verification and validation should be done at the appropriate level. See section 3 for an 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
explanation of these terms.  For example, validation of a signalling system should be 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
undertaken at the system level, whereas individual components would be validated at the 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
subsystem level.  

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
2.6.2 The products will normally undergo a comprehensive regime of testing, comprising tests 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
in the laboratory and factory environment and latterly in their target environment. The 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
tests will seek to provide evidence to verify and validate that the products meet their 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
requirements and are fit for purpose and that the safety functionality has been correctly 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
implemented. This may include a set of routine tests for ‘proven’ products and more 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
comprehensive tests for newly developed items of equipment. Testing may comprise the 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
following: 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
 Unit testing – test carried out by the software developer to verify compliance 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
of units of software with their requirements. The depth and extent of test 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
coverage will depend on the safety integrity level (SIL) of the item under test.; 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
 Qualification testing – carried out by the hardware developer to prove correct 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
functionality of the hardware, and non-functional requirements, such as shock 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
and vibration, temperature and humidity, reliability.  

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
 Software functional testing – carried out by the software developer to prove 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
correct functionality of the software and that it does not exhibit any 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
unexpected behaviour or hidden faults; 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
 Safety functional testing – carried out at all levels of the system assembly to 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
prove the correct functionality of the safety functions under normal and failure 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
conditions; 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
 Installation testing – a set of tests conducted on equipment installed in its 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
intended location and environment to confirm correct installation; 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
 Integration test – carried out at a number of test stages to confirm that sub-

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
assemblies, products, subsystems and systems are correctly integrated to 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
ensure that they operate correctly together; 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
 Interface testing – used to prove correct functioning of the interface between 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
two or more interfacing pieces of equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
 Test and commissioning – testing on the installed system to ensure that it 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
performs the correct functions and does not have any hidden faults. This 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
phase of testing may also include testing to ensure that the principles of safe 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
railway operation have been adhered to (‘principles testing’). The final stage 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
confirms that the system will operate as expected with the surrounding 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
railway equipment with which it will interface.

2.7 Commissioning & Handover 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
2.7.1 This phase includes all activities required to bring the system into full service, including 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
testing and commissioning for signalling and trial running of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
2.7.2 There are two linked but separate objectives: 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
 To demonstrate that the system is ready to be put into service; 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
 To demonstrate that the railway organisation is ready to accept the system 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
into service.  This includes: 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
o Training 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
o Maintenance manuals 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
o Operation manuals 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
o Correct organisation 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
o Spares 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
o Planning 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
2.7.3 Acceptance and handover of the tested and commissioned system to the operator/user 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
will normally require the satisfactory completion of a number of activities: 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
 Safety approvals of the system including its operation and maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
systems by the necessary approval bodies; 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
 Audit of test records; 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
 User acceptance tests – acceptance through testing or trials that the system 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
meets its stated requirements and can be operated by the user; 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
 Processes for checking the competence of staff who have worked on the 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
project; 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
 Handover operations and maintenance (O&M) systems to the operator and 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
maintainer, including training, O&M manuals, relevant safety case information 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
and accurate “as built” records of the design (including version details for 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
traceability purposes). 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
2.8 Operations & Maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
This phase includes all activities involved with the normal operation of the system.  The 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
maintainer is responsible for the safe, whole life performance of the system.  This 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
includes replacement of components and subsystems within the system. This phase only 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
ends when the system is removed from service. 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
Maintenance testing is needed to ensure that the equipment remains in a safe and reliable 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
state.  This includes testing after items of equipment are replaced by similar units.  Test 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
plans are needed to define the tests required.  Technicians doing these tests should be 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
monitored periodically to prevent bad practice or short cuts that omit vital parts of the 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
test.  A record should be kept of all maintenance tests. 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
2.9 Decommissioning & Disposal 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
2.9.1 The Decommissioning and Disposal phase includes all activities involved in removing the 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
system from the railway.  For most signalling systems, decommissioning coincides with 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
or overlaps the commissioning of a new system. 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
2.9.3 The decommissioning or disposal of a system is as much a change to the railway as the 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
introduction or commissioning of a new system and should be planned and executed 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
with care. These activities must be planned and implemented so as to ensure the safety 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
of any train operations that continue through the period of transition. 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
2.10 Stage Gates or Decision Gates 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
 The division of a project into discrete steps or stages, permits those working on the 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
project to stop and check that as a whole the project will deliver what is expected of it. It 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
is all too easy for individual disciplines to become separated from the rest of the project 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
(particularly where a project is delivered from multiple locations) and develop their 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
designs without consideration of how it must integrate with others.  It is also possible for 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
projects to forget the original problem being solved and begin to move towards offering 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
something that does not meet the client’s requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
2.11 Uses of Stage Gates 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
Consider the following when using stage gates: 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
 Review the requirements that must be satisfied; 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
 Provide objective evidence that these requirements are being met; 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
 Confirm that designs comply (or will comply) with relevant legislation, 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
consents, agreements etc. 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
 Look for opportunities to approve products or systems that are approved for 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
use on other administrations (with similar functions, environment and 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
interfaces) without the need to examine evidence from first principles. 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
 Determine that all applicable standards have been identified and any 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
necessary derogations applied for and if possible, granted; 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
 Ensure that technical risks have been adequately captured, assigned to an 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
owner, appropriate mitigations identified and implemented; 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
 Review the proposed design against the project costs of the project; 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
 Be assured that interfaces have been identified and properly designed so that 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
individual design elements will integrate and work together as intended; 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
 Confirm that the proposed design can be constructed given limitations of 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
technology, available equipment and site conditions; 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
 Review assurance evidence for each individual item of design; 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
 Review the programme timescales and apply any remedial action should 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
delays be identified. 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
2.12 Engineering Approvals 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
Engineering approvals of designs, documents and products take place throughout a project’s 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
life cycle, but stage gates are an opportunity to check that all engineering controls are in 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
place.  Project engineering controls are an essential tool to ensure the delivery of safe and 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
efficient outcomes. 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
2.13 Cross-acceptance 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
The process of approving a new product or system can be more efficient if it is already in use 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
elsewhere (typically on another railway system).  This cross-acceptance approach for a 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
product will need to examine whether it is being used for the same function in a similar 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
environment and with similar interfaces to the remainder of the system.  The quality and 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
scope of the acceptance process of the other administration is also relevant.

3. Verification, Validation and the V Model 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
3.1 Verification and Validation 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
These are key concepts in the process of ensuring that a project is delivering a system that meets the 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
client’s requirements and is also fit for purpose. 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
 Validation. The objective of validation is to provide confirmation, through the provision of 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
been fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
 Verification. The objective of verification is to demonstrate that the requirements of each 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
life cycle phase have been fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
3.2 The V-Model 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
3.2.1. A V-model is a common graphical representation (as shown in Fig. 1 below) of the 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
system engineering life cycle. The left side of the V represents concept development and the 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
decomposition of requirements into function and physical entities that can be designed, and 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
developed. The right side of the V represents integration of these entities (including 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
appropriate testing to verify that they satisfy the requirements) and their ultimate transition 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
into the field, where they are operated and maintained.  The V-model can be viewed as a 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
time-line in the form of a "V". The product moves sequentially from the first phase, "Concept", 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
to the next phase, "System definition and application conditions", etc. 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
3.2.2.  Throughout the process, evidence will be gathered from a variety of sources including 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
the review of specifications and the results of actual tests. 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
Fig. 1 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
3.2.3. The principal advantage of the V-model is that it shows the relation of verification and 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
validation to the activities in the lifecycle and makes clear their role in finding defects at an 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
early stage and preventing the propagation of defects through the lifecycle.

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
For projects incorporating a high degree of novelty or innovation the life-cycle may have to be 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
modified to include prototype testing or proof of concept. 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
4.  Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS). 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
4.1 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
 Reliability is the probability that an item can perform a required function under given 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
conditions for a given time period 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
 Availability is the ability of a product to be in a state to perform a required function 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
under given conditions at a given instant of time or over a given interval  

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
 Maintainability is the ability of a system to be retained in, or restored to a state to 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
perform as required, under given conditions of use and maintenance. Given 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
conditions would include aspects such as: location for maintenance, accessibility, 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
maintenance procedures and maintenance resources” 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
 Safety is freedom from unacceptable risk of harm. 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
The goal of a railway system is to achieve a defined level of rail traffic in a given time, safely.  

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
For the demonstration of RAMS, a RAM Programme and Safety plan needs to be developed for 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
the project, so that during the system requirements phase, the following analysis needs to be 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
considered within the RAMS programme: 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
 Failure Modes Effects Analysis (FMEA), fault tree analysis, for reliability; 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
 Data analysis for availability improvement and prediction for availability; 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
 Maintenance task analysis, personal safety procedures for maintainability; 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
 Defining safety related functional requirements, establish safety management 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
processes. 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
4.2 Systematic and Random Failures 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
4.2.1 The RAMS of a railway system is influenced in three ways: 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
 by sources of failure introduced internally within the system at any phase of the system 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
lifecycle (system conditions), 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
 by sources of failure imposed on the system during operation (operating conditions) 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
and  

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
 by sources of failure imposed on the system during maintenance activities 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
(maintenance conditions). 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
4.2.2 Failures occurring due to internal disturbances in the system at any phase of system 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
lifecycle are systematic failures or random failures.  Systematic failures occur due to 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
errors in requirements, design inadequacies, manufacturing deficiencies, software errors, 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
human errors in installation or maintenance, etc.  Random failures occur due to wear out, 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
over stress, stress degradation, environment, etc, beyond that which could have 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
reasonably been foreseen during the specification and design phases or due to failure of 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
components which do not match their intended specification because of deficiencies in 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
manufacture or quality control.

5. Security 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
5.1 Protection against Cyber Attacks 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
5.1.1  From the point of view of cybersecurity, railway signalling and communication systems 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
have much in common with Industrial Control Systems (ICS, also known as Industrial 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
Automation and Control Systems, IACS). They comprise a combination of both cyber 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
and physical components, such as sensors and actuators and they incorporate 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
networking devices and communication protocols; they commonly have long service 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
lives, and comprise multiple generations of equipment from a wide range of suppliers; 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
their software is often custom-written, using bespoke or older, unsupported operating 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
systems. They are both potential targets of cyber-attacks from sources such as viruses, 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
hackers, organised criminals, terrorists and state-sponsored groups. Consequently, 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
cybersecurity for railway signalling and control applications can benefit from study of 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
good practice and standards in ICS. 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
5.1.2 For ICT (Information Communication Technology) system, increasing use of IP (Internet 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
Protocol) technology and commercial off-the-shelf operating systems in railway systems 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
makes it important to understand the architecture and specific functions of those 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
systems. Consider whether part of the system is networked, or whether there are 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
interfaces with other systems that are. Understand how these systems share data, and 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
what level of security is in place (passwords, encryption, firewalls, etc.). A system is only 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
as secure as its weakest line of defence. Where systems that have been designed 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
separately are connected together (such as railway ICS) a cyber analysis of the whole 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
system should be carried out. Examples of cyber threats include web application attacks, 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
phishing through email, denial of service, malware. Consider whether important 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
passwords are secure, review the use of USB flash drives, and establish an incident 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
response plan in case of an attack. The objectives of a cyber-attack may not be obvious, 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
and can range from causing injury or disruption, to undetected data theft and reputational 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
damage. 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
5.2 Cybersecurity Design Principles 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
5.2.1 The cybersecurity design principles listed below have been derived from the review of 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
best practice and existing sources and standards undertaken in the course of developing 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
a European Technical specification addressing cybersecurity within the railway sector. 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
 Secure the weakest link. This design principle aims to push the designer to 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
consider the security of all the components of the system and not only the most 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
obvious, such as the protocols or the interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
 Defence-in-depth (several diverse protections in sequence) 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
 Fail secure (comparable to fail safe, but sometimes these two principles can be in 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
conflict). 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
 Grant least privilege (each component should have only those privileges to 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
accomplish its specified functions, but no more). 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
 Economise mechanism (avoid redundancies and overlapping of functionalities) 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
 Authenticate requests (check identity of users, human or devices) 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
 Control access (grant access only to authorised entities (users, programs, 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
processes or other systems). 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
 Assume secrets not safe (assume an attacker knows the details of the system) 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
 Make security usable (avoid annoying and painful mechanisms) 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
 Audit and monitor 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
5.3 Safety and Security 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
5.3.1 Safety and security have complementary goals but are sometimes in conflict over the 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
means to achieve their respective goals.

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
 In safety, frequent changes should be avoided because of the cost of safety 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
demonstration. In security, update should be easy in order to be able to patch the 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
system in a timely manner. 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
 From the safety perspective an emergency message (e. g. to immediately shut 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
down or stop a system) should be transmitted as fast as possible and the 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
reaction should be executed immediately. From a security perspective the 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
message should be authenticated to prevent masquerade which might lead at 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
least to denial of service, but the calculation and checking of cryptographic codes 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
consumes time and leads to a delay of the emergency message and the reaction. 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
5.3.2 Trade-off between safe and secure design is not easy and it can be hard to find an 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
optimal solution. Safety and security are different and cannot easily be merged: security 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
cannot simply be regarded as an add-on to safety or vice versa. The following principles 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
are aimed at achieving a harmonious relationship between security and safety. 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
 Safety and security are different and should be treated as such 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
 The security environment should protect essential functions, including safety 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
 Cybersecurity Threat & Risk Analysis is the main interface with Safety Analysis. 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
 Separate security and safety as far as possible but coordinate them effectively 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
 Security should be evaluated on the basis of international standards, e.g. IEC 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
62443 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
 It is infeasible to evaluate the Security Risk probabilistically. 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
 Safety and Security Target measures should not be coupled. 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
 Security is a collaborative continuous effort. 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
5.4 Protection against Physical Attacks, Theft & Vandalism 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
Physical attacks, theft and vandalism are all potential threats to the safety and availability 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
of railway signalling and communications systems. For defence in depth to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
cybersecurity the first barrier should be physical protection; with no trust on who can 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
access the hardware, there is no trust on the data. Vandalism incidents include malicious 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
damage and arson. Theft normally targets high value lineside equipment such as copper 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
cables. Both vandalism and theft can adversely affect safety by damaging equipment in 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
ways not seen as credible in the normal design process, e.g. by causing multiple 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
simultaneous failures. 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
Measures to reduce risk include: 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
 Fencing 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
 CCTV 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
 Cable alarms 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
 Buried or secure cable routes 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
 Fibre cable instead of metal 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
 Security of equipment housings and rooms 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
 Lighting 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
 Movement detection

6. Obsolescence Management 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
6.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
Items become obsolete when they can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
created, or when there is a clear advantage in changing to a new product or technology.  Three types 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
of obsolescence are described below. 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
6.1.1  Obsolescence affects all products and it impacts upon all stages of their life. The term 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
includes: 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
 Capital equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
 Infrastructure; 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
 Consumer durables; 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
 Consumables; 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
 Software products. 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
6.1.2  Obsolescence is inevitable and it cannot be avoided, but forethought and careful 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
planning can minimise its impact and its potential high costs. The objective of 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
obsolescence management is to ensure that obsolescence is managed as an integral 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
part of design, development, production and in-service support in order to minimise cost 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
and detrimental impact throughout the product life cycle. 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
6.1.3  Obsolescence presents itself in three ways: 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
 The item is no longer suitable for current demands; or 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
 The item is no longer available from the original manufacturer; or 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
 The item can no longer be maintained because people with the necessary 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
skills are no longer available. 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
6.2 Product Suitability 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
6.2.1  A system or product is designed to meet the requirements of the project at a specific 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
moment in time.  Additional functionality can be added to meet a future need.  This is 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
only a good idea if that future need is clear and/or the extra functionality does not add too 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
much cost or complexity.  Otherwise it can add design complexity, add cost (including 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
design effort, manufacture and ongoing maintenance), reduce reliability and in the end, 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
may not be what is actually required. 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
6.2.2  There is a need for products and systems to be ‘future-proof’ by which is meant minimal 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
changes are required to enable the product or system to continue in operation for as long 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
6.2.3  A good approach for ‘future-proofing’ is to take time at the start of the project 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
understanding what the user’s needs are and how these might realistically change over 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
time. This is not a perfect science, but careful consideration will ensure that all 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
reasonable options can be considered and costed, enabling the design to progress. 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
Issues that will need to be considered include: 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
 Increases or decreases in demand; 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
 Changes in supporting technology; 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
 Changes in customer behaviour and expectations; 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
 Legislation changes; 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
6.3 Item Availability 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
6.3.1 The availability of product parts reduces over time as manufacturers cease to make 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
them. Mechanical items can be remade if the drawings are available (or can be re-

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
drawn). And depending on the application, the advent of 3D printing may ease the supply 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
of old parts. 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---

v6.docxSystems Management article 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
v6.docx 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
6.3.2 Electronic components, particularly semi-conductor circuits, are very likely to be hard to 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
source as time moves on. Manufacturers move on to the next iteration of the item and 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
may cease its manufacturing altogether and make something new. It is also possible that 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
the manufacturer can cease trading. 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
6.3.3 In these cases, an alternative part must be found if the project or system is to remain in 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
operation. This requires as full an understanding as possible of the functions and 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
interfaces of the obsolescent item concerned so that a replacement can be properly 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
specified. For legacy items, this is often hard to capture due to lack of appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
documentation and loss of staff knowledge (see below). Designers today, should ensure 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
that each item is properly documented to enable its replacement by something suitable in 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
the future should the need arise. 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
6.3.4  The key functions include: 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
 Operating environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure, 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
power supply resilience); 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
 Input timing considerations, particularly for microprocessor and memory 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
chips; 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
 Storage requirements (e.g. temperature, shelf time - especially for batteries, 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
humidity) 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
 Earthing arrangements; 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
 Operating sequence, where the receipt of some information before other 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
information may be critical but undocumented; 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
6.4 Staff Knowledge 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
6.4.1 The failure to maintain sufficient corporate knowledge of a product (e.g. its history of 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
development, experience of in-service operation and failures, frequent faults and their 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
remedies) can lead to a loss of knowledge about that product. The result can be a 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
reduction in reliability, poorly installed products, poor maintenance and badly applied 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
modifications. 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
6.4.2  This can be particularly relevant to software modifications, especially if it has been 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
poorly documented. 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
6.4.3 The skills of staff need to be maintained because some will retire or move to another 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
job.  Training, comprehensive documentation and succession planning are tools to 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
address this. 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---

7. Configuration Management 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
7.1 Configuration management follows four main principles: 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
 Each piece of information or product is uniquely identified, not just by type, 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
but as a unique item in its own right. 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
 Each piece of information or product can have a status associated with it, and 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
a record of its history. 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
 The component parts that make up a product or system can be listed, and 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
associated together. Documents can also be similarly related. Examples are a 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
set of requirements documents for a system, or plans for related sub-projects. 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
 Associations between elements of a wider system can be captured, so that if 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
one item changes, then it is known that another must also change. 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
7.2 Configuration management consists of four basic elements 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
 Identification. 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
 Change Management 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
 Status Accounting 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
 Audit and review 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
7.3 Identification. Set the identification system for each configured item. This will not 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
necessarily be the same for each item. Documents will almost certainly need a different method 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
from products for example. Thought should be given to the creation of a document tree, and 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
product list. 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
7.4 Change Management. Changes have to be managed, otherwise people will be 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
working from different sets of uncontrolled information, resulting in costly delays later on in the 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
project. There needs to be a change control process that ALL changes go through. A system of 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
version control is needed for both hardware and software.  But the change process should also 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
take into account the different needs of major and minor changes, so that changes are given 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
the appropriate scrutiny and then authorisation. Baselines provide a useful means of controlling 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
the issue of information, particularly where there are several pieces of information that are 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
related (e.g. various different product specifications for one system). This enables others to 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
work from a common set of information, and all changes and their impacts to be compared 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
against a known position. Finally, any information that is out of date, must be withdrawn, and 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
the change management process should enable this to take place and to demonstrate that is 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
has occurred. 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
7.5 Status Accounting. This provides a view of the current status of configuration items 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
(number of changes, those pending, actioned etc.).  People can see what changes have 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
occurred, and when they occurred. They can also see which proposed changes have been 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
rejected. 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
7.6 Audit and review There is often pressure to deliver the job now and update the 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
documents later. In the long term, this attitude can be costly to a project. Performing audits and 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
reviews challenges people to adhere to the process. It also provides a record that the process 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
has been followed.

8. Use of DRACAS and FRACAS 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
 The terms DRACAS (Defect Recording, Analysis and Corrective Action System) and 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
FRACAS (Fault Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System) are often used 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
interchangeably. While they overlap, they are different. 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
 FRACAS specifically addresses faults and failures, i.e. when something is no longer 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
performing its intended function. Such a system would typically be used by a maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
organisation to manage and record in-service failures. Analysis of these failures can lead to 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
quicker repair times as common faults can be highlighted and appropriate repair mechanisms 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
or preventative measures put in place. 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
 DRACAS has a wider remit, embracing not only faults, but other incidents and observations 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
which, combined with faults, provides a richer picture of equipment performance and can lead 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
to a significant improvement in reliability. Such a system would typically be used by a design 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
organisation as the item under consideration is developed for in-service operation. It may also 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
be used by a maintenance organisation. It is good to start using a DRACAS as early in the 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
lifecycle as possible to capture defects as they occur throughout design. 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
8.2 Defect Recording / Fault Reporting 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
8.2.1 The first step in the process is to record the defect (or record the fault). The initial details 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
necessary are: 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
 Observed defect / fault 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
 The effect of the default/fault on the operation of the equipment and, if 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
relevant, the safe operation of the railway; 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
 Date, time and location of where and when the defect was first observed; 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
 Details of what was happening at the time; 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
 Details of the equipment involved (type, model, manufacturer, serial number, 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
software version) 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
 Details of personnel involved; 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
 Details of the person making the report; 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
8.2.2  The report record then needs to be stored. Supporting this should be a process that 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
takes the recorded information and makes it available for relevant personnel. Such 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
personnel could include: 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
 Designers; 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
 Maintainers; 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
 Operators; 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
 Safety engineer. 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
8.2.3.  The information should then be used (alongside data from previous faults) for analysis 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
and corrective actions to improve future performance.  

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
