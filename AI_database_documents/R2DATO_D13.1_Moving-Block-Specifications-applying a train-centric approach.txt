EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
This Deliverable contains an Architecture description, Requirements, and Hazard Analysis for an 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
ETCS Moving Block System, in accordance with the GA Project 101102001 — FP2 - R2DATO and 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
represents the collaborative WP approach of refining the System Pillar work e.g. CCS architecture 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
and harmonized operational rules to derive a System Specification for a Moving Block System.     

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
This document is a Deliverable from WP13 Moving Block ETCS Level 3 – Specification. The 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
Deliverable consists of four parts. The first part is the introduction, the second part the result of the   

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
Task 13.1 - System Definition, the third the result of the T ask 13.2 - System Specification and the 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
fourth part the result of the Task 13.3, namely the Safety Analysis. 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
Work on this deliverable is actively progressing within WP14. As part of this effort, the Safety Analysis 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
is being updated to address the outstanding comment raised by the external reviewer.

2 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
This document introduces the Deliverable 13.1 which consists of three parts corresponding to tasks 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
within the work package. Those parts are shortly described below. 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
2.1 TASK 13.1: SYSTEM DEFINITION 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
The objective of this Task (13.1) is to define the signalling system, called Moving Block System, in 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
particular the system objectives, capabilities, boundaries, functions, operational requirements and 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
assumptions in order to cooperate with the Moving Block concept and constitutes the first part of the 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
Deliverable 13.1. 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
2.2 TASK 13.2: MOVING BLOCK SPECIFICATION – REQUIREMENTS, ENGINEERING, 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
AND OPERATIONAL RULES  

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
Based on the System Definition the purpose of this task is to analyse the impact of the System Pillar 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
on System Requirements and to develop a Moving Block Specification. The work on the Moving 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
Block Specification is organized in an iterative and incrementa l fashion in five releases. The first 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
three releases are planned for WP13 and releases 4 and 5 are planned for WP14. The contents of 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
each release are defined in collaboration with the stakeholders (e.g. prototype developers and the 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
demonstrators WP). Each release leads to an intermediate and reviewed version of the Moving Block 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
Specification.  

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
2.3 TASK 13.3: MOVING BLOCK SAFETY ANALYSIS 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
The subject of this task was the safety analysis for the “Moving Block System” (MBS) that has been 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
specified in Tasks 13.1 and 13.2.  To move a step beyond what was previously done in S2R (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
in-depth analysis of relevant operational scenarios) a novel method – called System Theoretic 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
Process Analysis (STPA) - was applied to the matter. This STPA focuses on “unsafe control actions” 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
in control and feedback loops within complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
potential to identify emerge nt risks stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems, 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
which are often overlooked.

3 CONCLUSIONS 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
The aim of this Deliverable is to define the System Architecture, Requirements and a Safety Analysis 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
for a Moving Block System based on a train-centric approach using Full Moving block principles with 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
Trackside Train Detection (TTD). 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
The Deliverable serves as a basis for prototype development of a Moving Block System and the 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
alignment process with the System Pillar to define the CCS target architecture. 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
The work on the System Definition, Specification and Safety Analysis will be continued in WP14 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
Task 14.4.

WORK PACKAGE GLOSSARY 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
Note: Some of those terms are currently also defined in the Glossary of other documents (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
System Specification, Safety Analysis) of D13.1. Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
document available, care must be taken to keep the definitions synchronised.  

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
Term Definition 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
Area of Control The Area of Control  is the topologically limited extent and the 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
infrastructural Trackside Assets in this geographical extent. The term is 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
used here for defining the technical and operational responsibility of one 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
Domain Data The Domain Data refers to use case specific configuration data for the 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
MBS to define the specific application. These can be broadly classified 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
as Map Data, Segment Profiles, and Parameter Data. As a part of 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
configuration process, the MBS needs Domain Data.  Potential updates 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
of Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl. 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
synchronous activation of the new data version. 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
Operational Plan The Operational Plan is the result of the planning process performed by 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
the planning system (TMS). It describes either a planned Operational 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
Movement, Operational Restriction or Operational Warning Measure 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
through a temporal sequence of Operational Events to be implemented 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
by underlying subsystems in the Area of Control. 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
Operational State The Operational State consists of train-related information (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
permissions, authorisations or train position) and track-related 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
information (e.g., state of Trackside Assets). 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
System Capability A System Capability is a service an actor requires from the system to fulfil 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
its business goals. System capabilities are realised by exploiting one or 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
multiple functions, usually in a chain of functions. Syst em capabilities in 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---

behind it. 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
Train-centric A train-centric approach from a trackside point of view focuses on the 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
train as the true business object. A train object is derived by a train-centric 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
signalling system using the currently available sensor information from 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
the train and the trackside. This  allows the safety logic of train -centric 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
signalling system to operate on the train objects instead on the auxiliary 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
information ‘occupancy’ only as today in conventional block -centric 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
signalling systems. 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
Trackside Asset Trackside Assets are elements on or near the track which are used to 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
monitor (using sensors) and/or control (using actuators) the movement 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
of vehicles through the railway network. to provide a safe route through 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
the railway network. They can be switchable or non-switchable and are 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
controlled by the actors Trackside Asset Control and Supervision.

2 SYSTEM OBJECTIVE 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
2.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
The Moving Block System (MBS) is based on a train-centric approach using Full Moving block 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
principles with the overall objective to engineer high capacity, low cost, high reliability signalling 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
systems. The MBS is defined as a single system, without enforcing the conventional separation of 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
Radio Block Centre (RBC) and interlocking (IXL). The MBS is based on ETCS cab signalling without 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
lineside signals. It uses a more generic and simplified safety logic by abandoning the traditional block 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
concept mainly relying on signals.  By emphasising the safety l ogic, the dependency on country 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
specific operational processes is reduced. 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
The Moving Block System builds on the Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
System Pillar and the Moving Block specification defined in Shift2Rail [4] and RCA initiative [3]. 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
Depending on the requirements and needs, the MBS can operate within an environment where TTD 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
equipment is installed but also within an environment where TTD equipment is not installed. The 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
rationale for considering TTD is to support migration, recovery from degraded situations, and to 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
facilitate sensor fusion principles to foster different localisation inputs. 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
2.1.1 System capabilities  

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
The fundamental objectives of the MBS are to ensure safe train movement and prevent railway 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
accidents. They can be split into the following system capabilities:    

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
• MBS manages communication sessions with Trackside Assets (TA) via specified interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
within its Area of Control (AoC). 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
• MBS manages communication sessions with trains via specified interfaces within its AoC and 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
adjacent areas where trains are supposed to establish or terminate a communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
• MBS controls all TAs within its AoC. 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
• MBS manages the current trackside state and determines the state of the track from 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
information given during runtime by trains and TAs within its AoC. 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
• MBS manages all track path allocations for all trains and vehicles within its AoC. This contains 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
an adequate and risk -based protection of requested pieces of track for an intentional train 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
movement. 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
• MBS issues authorisations for train movements based on requested and accepted track path 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
allocations. 

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
• MBS supervises trains and TAs to prevent railway accidents. This includes especially any 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
collision, derailment or over-speeding. 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
• MBS stores an up -to-date, reliable and consistent current Operational State and provides 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
this Operational State to systems connected to MBS.  

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
• MBS manages Domain Data changes e.g., by introducing new parts of the track.

Interne 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
• MBS manages Usage Restriction Areas (URA) and ensures that any URA limitations or 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
constraints are considered for operation .  

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
• MBS handles a safe transition of train movement from and to adjacent systems.  

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
The system is providing Moving Block operation but it needs to be understood that its application is 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
more generic. As it authorises a movement to an arbitrary (operationally sensible) location which 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
might or might not be the rear end of the preceding train , it is in its core moving block agnostic, as 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
the on-board unit is. Thus, the MBS is capable of supporting fixed block, virtual fixed block and 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
moving block operation. It depends on the requesting Plan Execution (PE) system which operation 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
is actually performed. 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
2.2 LONG TERM OPERATING STRATEGY AND CONDITIONS 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
MBS shall offer increased operational flexibility (e.g., by enabling train movements from anywhere 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
to anywhere, not using pre-defined paths) allowing for both the minimisation of manual operation by 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
the dispatcher/operator and enabling faster recovery from degraded and emergency situations. 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
The long-term operating strategy of the MBS in combination with the interfacing systems revolves 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
around a high grade of operational automation. In the case of deviations from normal operation, the 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
higher level of automation facilitates the choice of flexib le, operational alternatives as well as the 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
reduction of risks associated with human errors by providing improved technical assistance (e.g., for 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
construction workers, maintenance staff, operators). 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
All in all, MBS should contribute to the increase in capacity by utilising shorter headways enabled by 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
the more efficient use of the infrastructure, the use of information of the running trains and the more 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
precise occupancy information through the combination of information sources (e.g., axle counters, 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
track circuits, Train Position Reports). 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
2.3 SYSTEM LIFE-TIME CONSIDERATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
System life-time is understood as system life -cycle within this system definition. MBS is foreseen 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
with a modular functional approach. Regarding this approach several life-cycle considerations have 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
to be considered: 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
MBS life-cycle is independent from life -cycles of surrounding systems. Any changes in PE, Digital 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
Register (DR) or Trackside Asset Control and Supervision (TACS) do not affect MBS as long as 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
interfaces used are unchanged. Due to generic safety logic, MBS life-cycle is independent from life-

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
cycle of Domain Data provided by DR. Changes in infrastructure and TAs only affects the Domain 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
Data of the  MBS without change the software of the MBS. MBS requirements lifecycle is envisioned 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
independent from hardware components and their operating systems. 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
The only dependency is given by the MBS functional lifecycle itself. 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
2.4 LOGISTIC CONSIDERATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
The MBS as described within this system definition is not a physical product. At this stage of 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
development, logistic considerations are not necessary.

3 SYSTEM BOUNDARIES 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
This section defines the environment and boundaries of the Moving Block System (MBS) by defining 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
the interfaces and interactions with other technological systems, the environment, humans and other 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
railway duty holders.  

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
As there is no target CCS reference architecture available yet, this chapter is based on the 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
assumptions consolidated in WP13. It is expected that the interfaces or details of the interface is 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
subject to change based on the evolvement of the target CCS reference architecture.  

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
An overview is shown in the following figure with the mentioned technological systems, environment, 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---

3.1 INTERFACES AND INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
This chapter defines the interfaces and interactions between the MBS and other technological 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
systems. For each technological system a description, the cardinality (from one MBS instance) and 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
the applicable standard (if any) to be used for the corresponding interface is provided.  

--- Document Chunk 683 ---

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
Attribute Content 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
Name Adjacent System 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
Description 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
An Adjacent System can be either radio-based ETCS related neighbouring system 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
or a neighbouring system not related to radio-based ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
A radio-based ETCS related neighbouring system can be either another MBS or a 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
neighbouring Radio Block Centre (RBC) and an IXL. The interface to such a 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
neighbouring system allows trains to pass the border to/from a neighbouring Level 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
2 area without changing the driver responsibility and the cab-signalling.  

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
A neighbouring system not related to radio based ETCS is an IXL. The interface to 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
such a neighbouring system allows trains to pass the border to/from an area not 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
equipped with Level 2. The cab-signalling is replaced by optical signals.  

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
Cardinality n 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
Interface 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
The interface to a radio-based ETCS related neighbouring system is based on the 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
existing ETCS specifications [1], namely Subset-039 and Subset-098.  

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
For the interface to a neighbouring IXL system it is recommended, but not 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
mandatory, to use the SCI-ILS interface as published in EULYNX [2]. 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
Notes:  

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
- Interfaces to neighbouring IXL systems depend on the supported interface 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
capabilities of the IXL and have to be adapted, e.g., by using adapter 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
solutions. 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
- An interface to an adjacent MBS may also require enhancements to the 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
existing ETCS specifications.

3.1.3 Digital Register 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
Attribute Content 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
Name Digital Register 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
Description 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
The Digital Register (DR) provides reliable (meaning complete, accurate, current,

and consistent, verified and validated), interoperable and accessible infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
information as a critical enabler for safety-related and non-safety-related functions. 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
The Digital Register includes static infrastructure information (static speed profile, 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
gradients, cant, etc.) and configuration data, which are approved after engineering 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
process. The interface between the DR and the MBS is used to update the data in

the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
Cardinality 1

5 SCOPE OF OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS INFLUENCING THE 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
SYSTEM 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
5.1 CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
The existing infrastructure today has the following characteristics that can impose constraints to the 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
system: 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
- Wide range of application of baselines and system versions 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
- Different application of L1, L1 with infill, L1 with loops, L2 with light signals, L2 only, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
- Highly specialised to fit to "traditional" country-specific rules 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
- Implement national laws that are sometimes indirectly related to rail traffic, e.g., laws for 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
public roads that affect the use of level crossings 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
In conclusion, to avoid Moving Block System (MBS)  dialects (e.g., in ETCS today), operational 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
harmonisation is necessary. This would drastically minimise the need for adjustments to MBS on a 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
national level. 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
Nevertheless, considering that the MBS will be integrated into existing railway infrastructure, MBS 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
shall be able to receive necessary information from these legacy systems to be able to ensure safe 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
movements inside its Area of Control (AoC). A major interface that needs to be established is the 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
interfaces for adjacent interlockings and RBCs to ensure a safe handover. The integration of legacy 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
Traffic Management Systems (TMS), control systems and object controllers have to be analysed as 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
well for migration purposes. Therefore, requirements have to be identified and exported to these 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
systems so that adapter solutions can be developed to connect them to MBS. MBS itself shall ideally 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
only communicate to another MBS and the systems specified in the target Traffi c CS architecture 

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
defined by the System Pillar. Legacy systems have to be adapted in order to communicate with MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
Note: The interface for handover to and from a legacy system (see also chapter 3.1.1) is out of scope 

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
for R2DATO Phase 1 and will thus be excluded in the following subchapters. The scope of R2DATO 

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
Phase 2 is not yet specified.  

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
5.2 SYSTEM OPERATING CONDITIONS AND CONSTRAINTS 

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
 The following operating constrains apply to MBS: 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
- Operation with national ATP is not possible  

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
- No light signalling is supported (with the potential exception of transition areas). 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
There are several operating conditions that apply to MBS: 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
- MBS supports ETCS Level  2. Flexible migration of fleets concerning the ETCS equipment 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
have to be considered, e.g., handling of different ETCS versions, functions and non-equipped 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
trains. 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
- Trains that deliver their train integrity and safe train length information to MBS as well as 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
trains that do not send this information have to be supported. 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
- The aim is a minimum or no manual interaction between driver and signaller.

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
- All movements inside the AoC of MBS are supervised. Furthermore, the logical handling of 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
all movements is the same, meaning that there is no distinction between shunting routes and 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
train routes anymore. The setting and protection of any kind of train/vehic le movement 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
(scheduled or not) is executed with the same set of functions that only change parameters 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
according to the intended movement on the track. However, this does not mean, that the 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
operational process of shunting (e.g., in the mode SH or SM) will n ot be necessary or is 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
planned to be eliminated. Only the technical implementation in MBS is referred to in this 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
operational condition. 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
- MBS is applicable for different types of railways lines (regional, low density, urban, main line, 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
high speed). 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
- The loading and activation of Domain Data to MBS is possible during MBS’ runtime. Thus, 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
MBS shall be independent from Domain Data update and change lifecycles. 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
5.3 SYSTEM MAINTENANCE CONDITIONS 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
The maintenance strategy provides the use of IT deployment strategies like continuous integration 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
based on reliable automatic configuration and test procedures. This enables a faster adaptation of 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
the infrastructure to operational needs than today. This in cludes the update of infrastructure data, 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
e.g., topology data update without restarting MBS, as well as other configuration data. MBS should 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
support the development of easily maintainable solutions e.g., with a feasible degree of modularity, 

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
thus reducing the maintenance effort for the staff e.g., changing the configuration of the system, 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
installing updates, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
Note: The physical aspects of maintenance are out of scope for now, thus e.g., changing of 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
hardware, cabling etc. is not considered. 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
Regarding the interface with actor Maintenance Staff, the necessity of an HMI has to be analysed 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
further during system specification. This interface will exclude some maintenance functionalities like 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
the activation of Domain Data as this is coordinated by the interfacing system Digital Register. 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
5.4 LOGISTIC SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
Physical architecture of the system is out of scope. Thus, no considerations about logistic support. 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
5.5 REVIEW OF PAST EXPERIENCE DATA FOR SIMILAR SYSTEMS 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
The general experience with a substantial subset of today's interlockings (IXL) is that there is no 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
standardised interface to it which causes a lot of project engineering and development effort in 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
interfacing systems. Oftentimes, the interfacing systems, like for example the control system, needs 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
detailed knowledge about the behaviour of the IXL to properly command it. Every change of the IXL’s 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
baseline leads to changes of all interfacing systems as they have to support new/changed 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
functionalities. High coordination effort to align the rollout and migration of all the affected railway 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
systems, e.g., control system, Radio Block Centre (RBC), TMS and track worker safety systems, is 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
needed. This is not only costly and prone to compatibility issues, but also sig nificantly prolongs 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
project durations. 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
A more specific example is the operation with ETCS. Due to the fact that the OPE TSI has a lot of 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
non-harmonised rules, major differences remain in the implementation of the same operational 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
processes in different countries. This is due to the freedom of choice and application of the trackside

(e.g., whether or not to “stop if in SR” balise, whether or not to apply packet 88, whether or not to 

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
apply reference balises, the start of mission procedure used). Additionally, differences arise from the 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
use of different class B systems. But even if the application of the TSI is chosen (i.e., ETCS), there 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
appear to be differences in the implementation and rules of operational processes. Also, this 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
“loophole” to use NTC/STM when implementing ETCS ultimately delays the rollout and operation 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
with ETCS. An example for this can be seen in the complex integration projects, e.g., for Abellio with 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
3 national ATPs and ETCS integrated on-board.   

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
The integration of ETCS also depends on the used interlocking. For example, when entering an 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
occupied track. Today, this is sometimes done in mode OS, sometimes done in SR or even in SH. 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
In most cases, the difference is due to differences in the functionality of the interlocking which is 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
used. Also, with relatively modern interlockings, which can support OS, SR or SH is implemented 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
nonetheless. 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
Note: EULYNX [2] is excluded from consideration here because there are no implementations of 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
this standard yet in operation.  

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
5.6 INFLUENCE ON OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, PASSENGERS 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
AND PUBLIC 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
There is no influence on passengers and public expected besides safety by design. 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
As the new system MBS needs to be maintained throughout its lifecycle, new maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
procedures and protocols are to be expected. From a hardware perspective, MBS components shall 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
be able to run on a new safe computing platform (standardised by the System Pillar). The deployment 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
on existing legacy hardware through e.g., emulation, can be analysed in a later specification level. 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
The MBS is expected to influence the operational procedures and conditions at least regarding the 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
available automated assistance for operational personnel, new procedures for Level 2 operation in 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
compliance with the ETCS Specifications [1] and for entering an occupied track. Therefore, it has to 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
be specified how MBS is supporting and managing operation and what is needed on the operational 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
side of things. The operational procedures to handle MBS shall not include business “logic” but be 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
based on necessary issues, not on national particularities/sensitivities.   

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
Note: The definition of the exact operational procedures is out of scope, because this is within the 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
scope of operational harmonisation in the System Pillar. 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
In order to use the MBS, training as well as operating manuals have to be provided to the railway 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
staff. 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
5.7 DESCRIPTION OF OPERATING PROCEDURES 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
The operation of MBS requires operating procedures as well as maintenance procedures. Similar to 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
EULYNX, there is an “operating mode” and “maintenance mode” of the system envisioned. If the 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
system enters “maintenance mode”, procedures for system installation, loading of new software data 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
and configurations can proceed. The maintenance mode as well the start of the procedures can be 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
activated either manually by e.g., actor Maintenance Staff, or automatically by an external actor e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
Plan Execution (PE) for planned maintenance. The transition to the “operating mode” of the system 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
is only possible after a successful system test activating the changes made to the system during 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
maintenance. Either MBS does the system test autonomously or/and in interaction with  local staff

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
that ensures that no one is endangered by the system activation e.g., by checking and confirming 

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
that no obstacles are in the area affected by the system update. 

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
5.8 MODES OF OPERATION 

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
Modes of operation in the following three major categories according to the TSI OPE [5] are covered 

--- Document Chunk 1041 ---
by the system:  

--- Document Chunk 1042 ---
- Normal operation  

--- Document Chunk 1043 ---
- Degraded operation  

--- Document Chunk 1044 ---
- Handling of emergency situations 

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
Several use cases that are part of the listed modes of operation have to be handled by the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
Firstly, the downgrade from normal situations to degraded situations have to be covered by MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
For this consideration, degraded situations can be defined as “the system with limited functionality”. 

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
Then, the recovery procedure to normal operation needs to  be handled by MBS, with or without 

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
interaction with interfacing systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
Furthermore, the recovery from emergency situations to operation in degraded situations has to be 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
handled by MBS. For example, the loss of train integrity monitoring on -board might trigger an 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
emergency reaction first. After the train integrity is assessed once more, the train can continue in 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
degraded situations with localisation by Trackside Train Detection (TTD).  

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
As a general principle, the handling of degraded situation shall be automated as much as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
This means that the operator shall intervene when a degraded situation can’t be handled by rules 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
(interplay between PE and MBS). In order to ensure safety, the human ability to judge and assess a 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
situation is needed either by technical means or through legal obligation.

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
integrity, then the MBS can trust the train for: 

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
- Train Length – Received in Validated Train Data as 

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
L_TRAIN, which is the maximum length of the train in rear of 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
the engine, counted from the front end of the engine 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
considering the active cab, and considering the coupling play 

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
and/or any other uncertainties in the length information. 

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
- Train Position Reports – including Q_LENGTH, L_TRAININT 

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
This is consistent with the approach in the ETCS Specifications [1]: 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
- On-Board can only confirm Train Integrity to Trackside if the 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
train length can be treated as SIL4.  

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
Justification: This means that the train length and information from 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
the train position reports (e.g., train integrity information) can be 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
used by the MBS to release track behind the train, and for length 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
calculations during splitting and joining.  

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
Note: This implies that the MBS won’t trust the train for the Train 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
Length if the train has never confirmed its train integrity (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
because the train is not equipped with a TIMS)  

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
T2 Train In case of joining or splitting of trains, this causes the external Train 

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
Integrity Monitoring System (TIMS) devices (in each train) to report 

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
loss of train integrity.  

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
As long as MBS has not acknowledged the new train data (incl. train 

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
length), the train integrity is not confirmed again by the train(s).  

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
Justification: The safe train length is not valid anymore when trains 

--- Document Chunk 1101 ---
physically join or split.

7 CONCLUSIONS 

--- Document Chunk 1126 ---
The aim of this document is to define the System Definition of the Moving Block System (MBS). 

--- Document Chunk 1127 ---
To achieve this, the document has provided the objective of the Moving Block System (MBS). 

--- Document Chunk 1128 ---
Hereby, the document focuses on the description of the capabilities, the boundaries (incl. a brief 

--- Document Chunk 1129 ---
description of the interfaces to other technological systems) and the system functions. Additionally, 

--- Document Chunk 1130 ---
the scope of operational requirements influencing the system have been elaborated. Further on, this 

--- Document Chunk 1131 ---
document also lists the necessary assumptions for the Moving Block System.

GLOSSARY 

--- Document Chunk 1419 ---
Note: Some of those terms are currently also defined in the Glossary of other documents (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 1420 ---
System Definition, Safety Analysis) of WP13. Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary 

--- Document Chunk 1421 ---
document available, care must be taken to keep the definitions synchronised.  

--- Document Chunk 1422 ---
Term Definition 

--- Document Chunk 1423 ---
Allocation Section Allocation Sections express gauge clearance conflicts between different 

--- Document Chunk 1424 ---
tracks.  

--- Document Chunk 1425 ---
For example, Allocation Sections are associated to the representation of 

--- Document Chunk 1426 ---
switchable Track Assets and further track connections like diamond 

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
crossings. 

--- Document Chunk 1428 ---
The Allocation Sections  are used in terms of granting a Movement 

--- Document Chunk 1429 ---
Permission request as condition for clearance in a certain area. 

--- Document Chunk 1430 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1431 ---
See also /FlankProtection/ 

--- Document Chunk 1432 ---
Area of Control (AoC) The Area of Control is the topologically limited extent used here for 

--- Document Chunk 1433 ---
defining the technical and operational responsibility of one instance of 

--- Document Chunk 1434 ---
MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 1435 ---
Domain Data The Domain Data refers to use case specific configuration data for the 

--- Document Chunk 1436 ---
MBS to define the specific application. These can be broadly classified 

--- Document Chunk 1437 ---
as Map Data, Segment Profiles, and Parameter Data. As a part of 

--- Document Chunk 1438 ---
configuration process, the MBS needs Domain Data. Potential updates 

--- Document Chunk 1439 ---
of Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl. 

--- Document Chunk 1440 ---
synchronous activation of the new data version.

--- Document Chunk 1442 ---
Domain Object A Domain Object is an abstract object for which a Domain (e.g. Moving 

--- Document Chunk 1443 ---
Block System) has the main responsibility. There might be other Domains 

--- Document Chunk 1444 ---
who are consumers of this object as well. In general, it is based on or 

--- Document Chunk 1445 ---
linked to the Domain Data. 

--- Document Chunk 1446 ---
Drive Protection 

--- Document Chunk 1447 ---
Section (DPS) 

--- Document Chunk 1448 ---
A Drive Protection Section is a linear contiguous stretch of track with a 

--- Document Chunk 1449 ---
driveability (passage possible yes/no) state.  

--- Document Chunk 1450 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1451 ---
A Drive Protection Section (DPS) represents a Track Edge Section that 

--- Document Chunk 1452 ---
can be brought to different driveability states to ensure the driveability or 

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
safety of a track route. As such, it is an abstraction for any location on the 

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
railway network that may adopt different states due to Switchable 

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
Trackside Asset (e.g. points or level crossings).

MBS Operational 

--- Document Chunk 1467 ---
State 

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
MBS Operational State  is the collection of all of Domain Objects  

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
instantiated by the MBS to manage its operations and supervise the train 

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
movements.  

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
This includes: 

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
• Train Objects, 

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
• Unresolved Trackbound Objects, 

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
• Trackside Asset Objects, 

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
• Movement Permission, 

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
• Etc... 

--- Document Chunk 1477 ---
MBS is operational MBS is operational when it is in a state allowing the MBS to perform its 

--- Document Chunk 1478 ---
fundamental function ensuring safe train movement and preventing 

--- Document Chunk 1479 ---
railway accidents, incidents... From now on, communication sessions to 

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
the external systems (e.g., OBU, PE, etc.) can be established and  

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
supervised. 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
Movement Permission The Movement Permission defines the part of the track that is reserved 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
for the movement of a train.  

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
It includes: 

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
- Movement Permission Extent  

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
Extent 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
A Movement Permission Extent is a linear contiguous stretch of track that 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
is reserved for the movement of a train. The Movement Permission is 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
translated to an authorisation (e.g. Movement Authority) according to the 

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
/ETCS/ - SUBSET-026 that is transmitted to the train. 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
The Movement Permission Extent is part of the Movement Permission.

Non-switchable 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
Trackside Asset 

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
A Non-switchable Trackside Asset is a Trackside Asset which provides 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
information to the MBS (e.g. Trackside Train Detection ) but cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
controlled to a particular state. 

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
Position is ambiguous The position information contained in a Train Position Report (Position 

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
Report or SoM Position Report with status valid) can be considered as 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
ambiguous in case MBS is not able to safely locate the train within the 

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
track layout. Since the Train Position Rep ort only contains a (directed) 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
distance to the LRBG, MBS might not be able to locate the train on the 

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
correct position in the track layout, e.g. in case of a zig -zag movement

Risk Buffer The Risk Buffer is a linear contiguous stretch of track that serves as the 

--- Document Chunk 1522 ---
overrun protection and in the event of a rollback of a chased train. It is 

--- Document Chunk 1523 ---
part of a Movement Permission. 

--- Document Chunk 1524 ---
A Risk Buffer exists if there is a Danger Point or a safe margin (project 

--- Document Chunk 1525 ---

Risk Path A Risk Path is one potential path (a linear contiguous stretch of track) by 

--- Document Chunk 1528 ---

--- Document Chunk 1529 ---
with a vehicle moving along the Movement Permission Extent.

Asset  

--- Document Chunk 1534 ---
A Switchable Trackside Asset is a Trackside Asset which enables (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 1535 ---
points, derailers, movable bridges, gates) or allows (e.g. light signals at 

--- Document Chunk 1536 ---
border, level crossings) the continuation of movement beyond this asset

Track Edge (TE) Track Edge is a linear object that defines an uninterrupted stretch of a 

--- Document Chunk 1540 ---
railway track without divergence or convergence. A Track Edge is defined 

--- Document Chunk 1541 ---
along the centre line of the 2D or 3D track alignment and has a finite

1 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
The task 13.2 “Moving Block Specification – Requirements, engineering and operational rules” within 

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
the WP13 of the project FP2 – R2DATO has got the objective to develop a Moving Block 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
Specification.  

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
As a result of this task, the present document specifies the Moving Block System, as firstly defined 

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
in the Moving Block System Definition (document /SysDef/). 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
This specification focuses on the functional requirements. Non -functional requirements are 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
considered in a later release of this document. 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
This document is related to the following work packages: 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
- WP13: Task 13.3: Moving Block Safety Analysis 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
- WP14: Moving Block ETCS Level 3 – Prototype development & Analysis 

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---

2 SCOPE OF WORK 

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
The scope of release 3 of the System Specification is limited as follows1: 

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
Capability: 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
• Start up the system 

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
• Load Domain Data at start-up  

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
• Control the Trackside Assets (SCI-P only) 

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
• Establish, maintain and terminate communication session with Trackside Assets 

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
• Manage track path allocation ( including Release allocated portion of track path which has 

--- Document Chunk 1993 ---
been passed by the train and Release allocated portion of track in front of the train) 

--- Document Chunk 1994 ---
• Manage authorisations for train movement (Movement Authority, Request to Shorten MA) 

--- Document Chunk 1995 ---
• Manage the current trackside state and determine the state of the track from information 

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
given during runtime by trains and Trackside Assets within its Area of Control 

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
• Store an up-to-date, reliable and consistent MBS Operational State and provide this to 

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
consuming systems (PE only) 

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---
• Establish, maintain and terminate communication session with OBU 

--- Document Chunk 2000 ---
Interface with 

--- Document Chunk 2001 ---
• Trackside Assets (SCI-P and SCI-TDS) via Trackside Asset Control and Supervision (TACS) 

--- Document Chunk 2002 ---
instances 

--- Document Chunk 2003 ---
• Plan Execution (PE)  

--- Document Chunk 2004 ---
• ETCS On-board (OBU) 

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
• Digital Register (DR) 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
The following needs are covered: 

--- Document Chunk 2007 ---
• Flank Protection 

--- Document Chunk 2008 ---
• Splitting, joining, turning (with/without Cold Movement Detection) 

--- Document Chunk 2009 ---
• DPS Group  

--- Document Chunk 2010 ---
• Propagation of UTOs 

--- Document Chunk 2011 ---
• Train length (L_TRAIN) reliability 

--- Document Chunk 2012 ---
All other interfacing systems according to /SysDef/ are out of scope for this release.  

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
For Trackside Asset, only SCI-P and TTD sections are considered.

This chapter contains general limitations that are valid for all releases of the System Specification.  

--- Document Chunk 2032 ---
- Disclaimer: this specification is not yet part of a complete safety analysis. 

--- Document Chunk 2033 ---
- As the System Specification also contains the functionality of an RBC, the MBS shall be able 

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---
to perform all the functions of the RBC Basic Interoperability Constituent (IC). Instead of 

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
repeating the /ETCS/, this document focuses on the essential functions of the MBS rather 

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
than specifying each function in detail of the RBC functionality.  

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
- This System Specification does not explicitly specify the rules to provide national values, 

--- Document Chunk 2038 ---
position report parameters and MA request parameters to the OBU. This depends on e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 2039 ---
the operational rules and therefore is assumed to be application specific.  

--- Document Chunk 2040 ---
- This System Specification focus on functional requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
- The swinging overlaps are currently not supported (see REQ-SC_DPS_RB). 

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
- The System Version 2.1 of /ETCS/ is only supported by the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 2043 ---
o Justification: This System Specification is used by the demonstrators using OBUs. 

--- Document Chunk 2044 ---
But there are no OBUs available yet supporting a newer System Version than 2.1. In 

--- Document Chunk 2045 ---
later editions of the System Specification newer System Versions will be supported.  

--- Document Chunk 2046 ---
- This System Specification does not explicitly specify how the cryptographic artefacts (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
KMACS) for the communication between MBS and the trains are made known to the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
Justification: According to chapter 2 this interface is out of scope of this System Specification.

3 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
The Moving Block System specification is developed according to the following inputs sources: 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
• Moving Block System Definition (ref. /SysDef/), which 

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
o defines the System capabilities to be performed.   

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---
o defines the external actors and the interfaces (System Boundaries).  

--- Document Chunk 2064 ---
• The EULYNX Standard (ref. /EULYNX/) 

--- Document Chunk 2065 ---
It is used for the interface with the Trackside Asset (I_TACS interface, see chapter 7.1) 

--- Document Chunk 2066 ---
• The CCS TSI (ref. /CCSTSI/),  

--- Document Chunk 2067 ---
o for the ETCS concepts and functionality  

--- Document Chunk 2068 ---
o for the interface with OBU (I_OBU interface, see chapter 7.3)  

--- Document Chunk 2069 ---
o for the interface with adjacent system (I_AS interface, see chapter in a later release) 

--- Document Chunk 2070 ---
o for the interface with Security Service (I_SEC interface, see chapter in a later release) 

--- Document Chunk 2071 ---
• RCA (ref. /RCA/) 

--- Document Chunk 2072 ---
• Shift2Rail Moving Block (ref. /S2R/)   

--- Document Chunk 2073 ---
• System Pillar – Global system architecture – input expected for a further release 

--- Document Chunk 2074 ---
• System Pillar – Operational scenario – input expected for a further release 

--- Document Chunk 2075 ---
• System Pillar – OpCon Operational Vision (ref. /OpCon/) 

--- Document Chunk 2076 ---
• System Pillar TCCS SD1 Data Model (ref. /SD1DM/) for the Domain objects description  

--- Document Chunk 2077 ---
• Requirement writing (ref. /SempR2/ and /SempR3/) 

--- Document Chunk 2078 ---
• Alignment with the Demonstrator Work Packages FP2-WP44 and FP2-WP45 

--- Document Chunk 2079 ---
• Alignment with the Digital Register Work Package FP2-WP27 

--- Document Chunk 2080 ---
• Alignment with the Plan Execution Work Package FP1-WP17 

--- Document Chunk 2081 ---
• Approved list and description of operational scenarios which have to be covered by the 

--- Document Chunk 2082 ---
System Specification. 

--- Document Chunk 2083 ---
o Note: As long as there are no operational scenarios available from System Pillar 

--- Document Chunk 2084 ---
Operational Design Domain, the work bases on the operational scenarios to be 

--- Document Chunk 2085 ---
covered by the Moving Block Demonstrator (WP44). 

--- Document Chunk 2086 ---
The goal of the System Specification is the derivation of the System Requirements from the System 

--- Document Chunk 2087 ---
Capabilities. 

--- Document Chunk 2088 ---
The approach to derive the System Requirements for the MBS is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 2089 ---
Step Description Chapter 

--- Document Chunk 2090 ---
1 The main concepts of /RCA/ and /S2R/ are evaluated and 

--- Document Chunk 2091 ---
consolidated. Afterwards the consolidated concepts are 

--- Document Chunk 2092 ---
described in detail in separate concept papers to be able to apply 

--- Document Chunk 2093 ---

--- Document Chunk 2102 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 2103 ---
it later for the specification of the System Requirements. A 

--- Document Chunk 2104 ---
justification is provided for each of the consolidated concepts. 

--- Document Chunk 2105 ---
2 Then the System Capabilities (as listed in the /SysDef/) related to 

--- Document Chunk 2106 ---
the operational scenarios are detailed. Afterwards this detailing is 

--- Document Chunk 2107 ---
used to derive sequence diagrams depicting the interactions of 

--- Document Chunk 2108 ---
the MBS with neighbouring systems connected to it. The 

--- Document Chunk 2109 ---
sequence diagrams are additionally utilised to derive th e 

--- Document Chunk 2110 ---
necessary System Functions. The same System Function may 

--- Document Chunk 2111 ---
be used by several capabilities or scenarios. 

--- Document Chunk 2112 ---
Chapter 5 

--- Document Chunk 2113 ---
3 Subsequently the derived System Functions are described and 

--- Document Chunk 2114 ---
the specific requirements for them are listed considering the 

--- Document Chunk 2115 ---
consolidated concepts (in step 1), if applicable. 

--- Document Chunk 2116 ---
Chapter 6 

--- Document Chunk 2117 ---
4 Based on the scenarios, the interface needs (e.g., messages, 

--- Document Chunk 2118 ---
etc.) are described considering existing standards and the 

--- Document Chunk 2119 ---
concepts, if applicable.

5.1 SYSC: START AND MAINTAIN MBS 

--- Document Chunk 2223 ---
5.1.1 Communication patterns 

--- Document Chunk 2224 ---
MBS has communication sessions to its actors according to the following list. For every actor it is 

--- Document Chunk 2225 ---
described why there is the initiator/responder role: 

--- Document Chunk 2226 ---
(MBS as session initiator) 

--- Document Chunk 2227 ---
• DR: DR is a service which provides topology data to its clients. It therefore acts in a server 

--- Document Chunk 2228 ---
role which means that clients (like MBS) establish the communication to the server. 

--- Document Chunk 2229 ---
• TACS: Defined by EULYNX, the interlocking (here: MBS) is responsible to initiate the 

--- Document Chunk 2230 ---
communication. 

--- Document Chunk 2231 ---
(MBS as session initiation responder) 

--- Document Chunk 2232 ---
• PE: MBS is a service to PE which serves requests to set Switchable Trackside Assets and 

--- Document Chunk 2233 ---
grant Movement Permissions. MBS therefore acts in a server role which means that PE 

--- Document Chunk 2234 ---
establishes the communication to the server (MBS). 

--- Document Chunk 2235 ---
• OBU: It initiates the communication as MBS won’t know all trains in its area until they connect 

--- Document Chunk 2236 ---
(/ETCS/ - SUBSET-026 §3.5.3.4 of /ETCS/). 

--- Document Chunk 2237 ---
MBS also supervises the communication  so it can react to a loss of communication.  

--- Document Chunk 2238 ---
If MBS is the session initiator, it means whenever a supervision function of MBS detects that there 

--- Document Chunk 2239 ---
is no communication, it establishes a communication (which might be the very first establishment at 

--- Document Chunk 2240 ---
start of MBS or a re-establishment after a communication loss):

5.2 SYSC: PRELOAD TOPOLOGY DATA 

--- Document Chunk 2345 ---
Description This capability allows to provide MBS with Topology Data initially. This finally

--- Document Chunk 2354 ---
MBS is operational0 

--- Document Chunk 2355 ---
 From release 5 on (more granular steps so this capability only does preloading):  

--- Document Chunk 2356 ---
MBS has loaded Topology Data  

--- Document Chunk 2357 ---
MBS is operational0 

--- Document Chunk 2358 ---
Postcondition(s) 

--- Document Chunk 2359 ---
(Failure) 

--- Document Chunk 2360 ---
MBS state related to Topology Data has not changed

Involved actor(s) DR 

--- Document Chunk 2363 ---
Trigger(s) 1. MBS starts up 

--- Document Chunk 2364 ---
2. (For further release) MBS receives the Topology Data from DR 

--- Document Chunk 2365 ---
Main Sequence Up to release 4: 

--- Document Chunk 2366 ---
1. MBS establishes a communication session with DR. 

--- Document Chunk 2367 ---
2. MBS requests Topology Data from DR 

--- Document Chunk 2368 ---
3. MBS receives Topology Data and activates them 

--- Document Chunk 2369 ---
From release 5 on: 

--- Document Chunk 2370 ---
1. MBS establishes a communication session with DR. 

--- Document Chunk 2371 ---
2. MBS requests Topology Data from DR 

--- Document Chunk 2372 ---
3. MBS receives Topology Data and pre-loads them. 

--- Document Chunk 2373 ---
4. MBS approves the activation of Topology Data  

--- Document Chunk 2374 ---
5. MBS activates Topology Data  

--- Document Chunk 2375 ---
Alternate Sequence From release 5 on: 

--- Document Chunk 2376 ---
At any point in time, DR can send Topology Data to MBS (continues then from 3. 

--- Document Chunk 2377 ---
on) 

--- Document Chunk 2378 ---
Failure Sequence 4. MBS rejects the approval when there are e.g. conflicting Movement Permissions 

--- Document Chunk 2379 ---
(for further release) 

--- Document Chunk 2380 ---
Comments Before release 5, there are the following restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 2381 ---
• The scope of Topology Data  is the full Area of Control  (so no partial 

--- Document Chunk 2382 ---
update) 

--- Document Chunk 2383 ---
• Topology Data are loaded only once at startup and remain unchanged (so 

--- Document Chunk 2384 ---
no update during run-time)

the request to a TACS command (Function: Translate TA State Request to TACS Command). The 

--- Document Chunk 2646 ---
TACS command is then sent to the related TACS (Function: Send TACS Command).

--- Document Chunk 2898 ---
Please consider that during this scenario after each Train Position Report (packet number 0 or

packet number 1), respectively after receiving the SoM Position Report, MBS updates the Train 

--- Document Chunk 2900 ---
Object by the capability “Update MBS Operational State” and reports this to the PE. This handling of

Train Position Reports is not explicitly illustrated in the figure to limit the sequence diagram to the

Start of Train capability.  

--- Document Chunk 2903 ---
During this scenario, after the acknowledgment of Train Data, it is possible (when the OBU is 

--- Document Chunk 2904 ---
equipped with a TIMS) that the MBS receives the first Train Position Report with integrity confirmed. 

--- Document Chunk 2905 ---
Then especially the extent of the Train Location using the confirmed rear end is updated.

--- Document Chunk 3061 ---
(/ETCS/). This may be necessary for the operational scenarios “Joining” 

--- Document Chunk 3062 ---
or to reschedule train movements.  

--- Document Chunk 3063 ---
Goal After receiving a cooperative shortening request  indicating that it is 

--- Document Chunk 3064 ---
requested to cooperatively shorten the MA from PE, MBS checks all 

--- Document Chunk 3065 ---
safety constraints and subsequently performs the cooperative 

--- Document Chunk 3066 ---
shortening of MA with the OBU.

Precondition None 

--- Document Chunk 3068 ---
Postcondition (Success) After the OBU has accepted the new MA and has informed MBS about 

--- Document Chunk 3069 ---

REQ-0029 FOR FURTHER RELEASE [X2R5 REQ-TrackInit-2] 

--- Document Chunk 3731 ---
The MBS shall utilise valid Stored Information to enable faster initialisation. 

--- Document Chunk 3732 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 3733 ---
Historic information on the state of the railway from before the MBS was restarted can 

--- Document Chunk 3734 ---
enhance the Initialisation process. 

--- Document Chunk 3735 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 3736 ---
The location of all trains in communication prior to the restart, along with the extent of 

--- Document Chunk 3737 ---
any MAs issued will be valuable information to be utilised. 

--- Document Chunk 3738 ---
The validity of the information used must be carefully considered, as if the MBS has 

--- Document Chunk 3739 ---
been offline for some time the State of the Railway is likely to have changed. 

--- Document Chunk 3740 ---

Initialisation to confirm that the procedure is completed. 

--- Document Chunk 3747 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 3748 ---
If Stored Information is not valid, the person in charge of initialising the MBS has to 

--- Document Chunk 3749 ---
confirm when the procedure is completed. They have the authority to confirm that all 

--- Document Chunk 3750 ---
the obstacles on the railway are known to the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 3751 ---
Guidance:

6.9 SYSF LOCALISE TRAIN  

--- Document Chunk 3810 ---
6.9.1 Overview  

--- Document Chunk 3811 ---
This function localises a communicating train within the Area of Control. The Train Location  

--- Document Chunk 3812 ---
information is stored in the Train Object.  

--- Document Chunk 3813 ---
Within the MBS, the Train Location for a train is the MBS interpretation of the location of the train, 

--- Document Chunk 3814 ---
based on Train Position Reports, Validated Train Data and other inputs if available, e.g. TTD 

--- Document Chunk 3815 ---
sections. 

--- Document Chunk 3816 ---
A Train Location has a front and a rear: 

--- Document Chunk 3817 ---
The front of the Train Location is the MBS view of the furthest position for the front of the train, 

--- Document Chunk 3818 ---
based on Train Position Reports and other inputs, e.g. TTD sections. 

--- Document Chunk 3819 ---
The rear of the Train Location is the MBS view of the furthest position for the rear of the train, 

--- Document Chunk 3820 ---
based on Train Position Reports, Validated Train Data, and other inputs, e.g. TTDs. 

--- Document Chunk 3821 ---

6.9.4 General Train Location Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 3903 ---
REQ-0063  

--- Document Chunk 3904 ---
To create or move a Train Location, the MBS shall perform the requirements sequentially 

--- Document Chunk 3905 ---
in the order they are found in Table 10. 

--- Document Chunk 3906 ---
Rationale:   For example, the position report requires the updating of the train 

--- Document Chunk 3907 ---
front location prior the updating of the train rear location.  Once the Train Location 

--- Document Chunk 3908 ---
has been updated by the position report, it can be updated again by the clear TTD.

6.9.5 Requirements to create a Train Location 

--- Document Chunk 3915 ---
REQ-TrainLoc-5    

--- Document Chunk 3916 ---
The MBS shall create a Train Location for the Train Object from the Min Safe Front End 

--- Document Chunk 3917 ---
to the Max Safe Front End derived from the Train Position Report  if the following 

--- Document Chunk 3918 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 3919 ---
• Train Position Report from an OBU where the reported position is unambiguous to 

--- Document Chunk 3920 ---
the MBS is received, AND 

--- Document Chunk 3921 ---
• there is no Train Location for this OBU, AND 

--- Document Chunk 3922 ---
• mode is different from SB 

--- Document Chunk 3923 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 3924 ---
This is to enable the MBS to record the Train Location of all communicating trains in 

--- Document Chunk 3925 ---
the Area of Control. 

--- Document Chunk 3926 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 3927 ---
The MBS will need to create a new Train Location: 

--- Document Chunk 3928 ---
• For an OBU which has started a communication session within the Area of 

--- Document Chunk 3929 ---
Control, but which is not performing Start of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 3930 ---
• For an OBU which has entered the Area of Control. 

--- Document Chunk 3931 ---
For a train which has started a communication session within the Area of Control, but 

--- Document Chunk 3932 ---
which is not performing Start of Mission, the new Train Location will be from Max Safe 

--- Document Chunk 3933 ---
Front End to Min Safe Front End, as there will be no train length provided yet.

--- Document Chunk 3942 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 3943 ---
For a train which has entered the Area of Control, and which has not confirmed Train 

--- Document Chunk 3944 ---
Integrity, the new Train Location will be at least from the Max Safe Front End to the 

--- Document Chunk 3945 ---
border of the Area of Control. This applies to both Handovers and Transitions. 

--- Document Chunk 3946 ---
How and when the first Train Location is established at the border to an Area of Control 

--- Document Chunk 3947 ---
is project specific. 

--- Document Chunk 3948 ---
Note: When Train Data message is received for a train not yet localised (i.e. without 

--- Document Chunk 3949 ---
existing Train Location), the Train Location is created for the front of the train due to 

--- Document Chunk 3950 ---
the Train Position Report contained in this message. The train rear is afterwards 

--- Document Chunk 3951 ---
localised using the Train Length (L_TRAIN) contained in the Train Data message (see 

--- Document Chunk 3952 ---
REQ-TrainLoc-6).

where the reported position is unambiguous to the MBS, the MBS shall create a Train 

--- Document Chunk 3958 ---
Location for that Train Object from the Min Safe Front End to the Max Safe Front End 

--- Document Chunk 3959 ---
derived from the Train Position Report. 

--- Document Chunk 3960 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 3961 ---
For a train which has a new connection to the MBS, the MBS must create a new Train 

--- Document Chunk 3962 ---
Location for the reported position. 

--- Document Chunk 3963 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 3964 ---
At Start of Mission, before the receipt of Validated Train Data, only the Estimated Front 

--- Document Chunk 3965 ---
End and its Confidence Interval are known to the MBS. The Train Location is then only 

--- Document Chunk 3966 ---
from Max Safe Front End to Min Safe Front End, as shown in Figure 22.

REQ-TMS-1 FOR FURTHER RELEASE [X2R5 REQ-TMS-1] 

--- Document Chunk 3990 ---
The TMS shall provide means for a Signaller to assign a position to a train that is reporting 

--- Document Chunk 3991 ---
a position during Start of Mission which is unknown or invalid, or a position which the 

--- Document Chunk 3992 ---
MBS considers ambiguous. 

--- Document Chunk 3993 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 3994 ---
This is to allow the MBS to locate a train in its Area of Control after a specific 

--- Document Chunk 3995 ---
operational procedure. 

--- Document Chunk 3996 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 3997 ---
How the Signaller enters the position of a train in the TMS is project specific, but the 

--- Document Chunk 3998 ---
MBS cannot accept a position in a clear area of track.

shall update the Rear End of the Train Location for this train using the new value of Train 

--- Document Chunk 4104 ---
Length. 

--- Document Chunk 4105 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4106 ---
The receipt of a new value of Train Length in Validated Train Data represents new

--- Document Chunk 4108 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4109 ---
The only information used from the Validated Train Data to determine Train Location 

--- Document Chunk 4110 ---
is the train length (L_TRAIN). 

--- Document Chunk 4111 ---
A new value of L_TRAIN means either the first value received since the Train Location 

--- Document Chunk 4112 ---
was created, or a changed value received at some later time. 

--- Document Chunk 4113 ---
If this is the first value for L_TRAIN received since the Train Location was created,

6.9.7 Reaction to Unexpected Train Locations – FOR FURTHER RELEASE 

--- Document Chunk 4192 ---
REQ-TrainLoc-12 FOR FURTHER RELEASE [X2R5 REQ-TrainLoc-12] 

--- Document Chunk 4193 ---
If a train reports a position that is unexpected or in conflict with other train movements, 

--- Document Chunk 4194 ---
the MBS shall react to transition the system to a safe state. 

--- Document Chunk 4195 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4196 ---
The MBS is reliant upon trains reporting their position to separate traffic safely and the 

--- Document Chunk 4197 ---
MBS must therefore react if it detects a potentially hazardous situation. 

--- Document Chunk 4198 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4199 ---
A train reporting an unexpected position can be a hazard even when there is TTD if 

--- Document Chunk 4200 ---
more than one train is in the same TTD section, but the situation is more severe in an 

--- Document Chunk 4201 ---
area without TTD. 

--- Document Chunk 4202 ---
The MBS will only be able to detect conflicts with other train movements which have 

--- Document Chunk 4203 ---
been authorised by the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 4204 ---
There are several situations where a position report from a train may require immediate 

--- Document Chunk 4205 ---
action from the MBS to avoid a potential hazard, for example: 

--- Document Chunk 4206 ---
• a train reporting a position in an area previously considered clear, e.g. at Start 

--- Document Chunk 4207 ---
of Mission, OR 

--- Document Chunk 4208 ---
• a train which has been allocated a Reserved Status Area reporting a position 

--- Document Chunk 4209 ---
which cannot be linked with that Reserved Status Area, OR 

--- Document Chunk 4210 ---
• a train reporting a position locating it within a Reserved Status Area allocated to 

--- Document Chunk 4211 ---
another train. 

--- Document Chunk 4212 ---
The specific reaction applied will depend on the situation and application specific

Interne 

--- Document Chunk 4231 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4232 ---
This is to make the TMS and Signallers aware in case the reported position could be 

--- Document Chunk 4233 ---
a real or potential hazard for other train movements.  

--- Document Chunk 4234 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4235 ---
A train reporting an unexpected position can be a hazard even when there is TTD if 

--- Document Chunk 4236 ---
more than one train is in the same TTD section, but the situation is more severe in an 

--- Document Chunk 4237 ---
area without TTD. 

--- Document Chunk 4238 ---
The MBS will only be able to detect conflict with other train movements which have 

--- Document Chunk 4239 ---
been authorised by the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 4240 ---
There are several situations where a position report from a train may require additional 

--- Document Chunk 4241 ---
intervention from the TMS or Signaller to manage the degraded situation. For example: 

--- Document Chunk 4242 ---
• a train reporting a position in an area previously considered clear, e.g. at Start 

--- Document Chunk 4243 ---
of Mission, OR 

--- Document Chunk 4244 ---
• a train reporting a position locating it within a Reserved Status Area allocated 

--- Document Chunk 4245 ---
to another train.

6.9.8 Impact from TTD on Train Locations 

--- Document Chunk 4249 ---
REQ-TTD-1    

--- Document Chunk 4250 ---
For a system using TTD, the MBS shall manage the asynchronicity between TTD section 

--- Document Chunk 4251 ---
status and Train Position Reports for a communicating train. 

--- Document Chunk 4252 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4253 ---
It will occur that the train physically occupies a TTD section before it has reported its 

--- Document Chunk 4254 ---
position within the TTD section (or vice versa). Similarly, the train may physically leave 

--- Document Chunk 4255 ---
a TTD section before it has reported its position beyond the TTD section (or vice versa). 

--- Document Chunk 4256 ---
The MBS must correlate these events. 

--- Document Chunk 4257 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4258 ---
The MBS must be designed to allow for: 

--- Document Chunk 4259 ---
• A TTD section becoming Occupied by a train before the train has reported a 

--- Document Chunk 4260 ---
position within the TTD section. 

--- Document Chunk 4261 ---
• A train reporting a position within the TTD section before TTD section becomes 

--- Document Chunk 4262 ---
Occupied. 

--- Document Chunk 4263 ---
• A TTD section becoming Clear after a train has left the TTD section before the 

--- Document Chunk 4264 ---
train has reported a position clear of the TTD section.

--- Document Chunk 4274 ---
• A train reporting a position clear of the TTD section before the TTD section 

--- Document Chunk 4275 ---
becomes Clear. 

--- Document Chunk 4276 ---
The MBS could use a variety of technical solutions to correlate TTD occupancy to Train 

--- Document Chunk 4277 ---
Position Reports. For example: 

--- Document Chunk 4278 ---
• Sending a Conditional Emergency Stop when a TTD is occupied, to stop a train 

--- Document Chunk 4279 ---
that is approaching a boundary of the TTD if it is not the one that occupied the 

--- Document Chunk 4280 ---
TTD. 

--- Document Chunk 4281 ---
• Use of a delay timer, to account for lack of synchronisation between Train 

--- Document Chunk 4282 ---
Position Reports and TTD occupancy. If a train is still not detected when the 

--- Document Chunk 4283 ---
timer expires, the MBS would react suitably. 

--- Document Chunk 4284 ---
• Tracking of TTD section occupancy and correlation with Train Position 

--- Document Chunk 4285 ---
Reporting, to ensure a normal sequence is observed. 

--- Document Chunk 4286 ---
Note: a combination of these techniques may be used, depending on project specific

requirements.

REQ-TTD-4 FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ-TTD-4] 

--- Document Chunk 4381 ---
For a system using TTD, when using Clear TTD sections to shorten a Train Location, the 

--- Document Chunk 4382 ---
MBS shall ensure that the length of the reduced Train Location is not shorter than the 

--- Document Chunk 4383 ---
length of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 4384 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4385 ---
Applying shortening should not result in the extent of the remaining Train Location 

--- Document Chunk 4386 ---
being less than the length of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 4387 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4388 ---
If the application of shortening the Train Location  results in the length of the Train 

--- Document Chunk 4389 ---
Location being less than the length of the train, it is project specific what alternative 

--- Document Chunk 4390 ---
action the MBS takes. For example, an application may decide to not apply any 

--- Document Chunk 4391 ---
shortening to the Train Location, or to apply equal shortening to the front and rear. 

--- Document Chunk 4392 ---
At boundaries, projects might decide to truncate the Train Location and as a result, 

--- Document Chunk 4393 ---
Train Location could be shorter than length of the train.

--- Document Chunk 4397 ---
For a system using TTD, when detecting an expected TTD occupancy within the 

--- Document Chunk 4398 ---
Movement Permission allocated to a train, after its Mute Timer has expired, the MBS shall 

--- Document Chunk 4399 ---
extend the Train Location of the train up to the closest of: 

--- Document Chunk 4400 ---
• the end of the Movement Permission’s Risk Buffer, OR 

--- Document Chunk 4401 ---
• the next boundary of this Occupied TTD section 

--- Document Chunk 4402 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4403 ---
The MBS can use TTD occupation to extend the Train Location of a train where the 

--- Document Chunk 4404 ---
Mute Timer has expired and is moving along the railway within the Movement 

--- Document Chunk 4405 ---
Permission allocated to it, thus maintaining the link between the Train Location and the 

--- Document Chunk 4406 ---
train, thereby facilitating recovery if communication is re-established. 

--- Document Chunk 4407 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4408 ---
A train where the Mute Timer has expired can move forward within the Movement 

--- Document Chunk 4409 ---
Permission allocated to that train and occupy a previously clear TTD. That occupation 

--- Document Chunk 4410 ---
can be attributed to a normal train movement. The MBS can adjust the knowledge

REQ-0037   FOR FURTHER RELEASE  [X2R5 REQ- LossComms-1] 

--- Document Chunk 4462 ---
The MBS shall, if configured, for each train with which it has an active communication 

--- Document Chunk 4463 ---
session supervise a defined timeout (a Mute Timer) after which the communication with 

--- Document Chunk 4464 ---
this train is considered lost. 

--- Document Chunk 4465 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4466 ---
This is to enable the MBS to react faster to the potential loss of communication with an 

--- Document Chunk 4467 ---
OBU than the timeout in the ETCS specifications. The ETCS specification timer of 5 

--- Document Chunk 4468 ---
minutes might be considered too long for some ETCS Level 3 systems. 

--- Document Chunk 4469 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4470 ---
This Requirement is mandatory if the Mute timer is used. 

--- Document Chunk 4471 ---
This is an optional functionality to be defined at application level based on the needs 

--- Document Chunk 4472 ---
of the system. The value of the Mute timer will be longer than the variable 

--- Document Chunk 4473 ---

Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4485 ---

--- Document Chunk 4508 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4509 ---
This Requirement is mandatory if the Mute timer is used. 

--- Document Chunk 4510 ---
If the extent of the MA sent to the train is less than the Movement Permission, then the 

--- Document Chunk 4511 ---
extension of the Unresolved Trackbound Object may only be to the end of the MA sent 

--- Document Chunk 4512 ---
to the train. 

--- Document Chunk 4513 ---
The criteria for establishing whether a train has entered a Radio Hole are project 

--- Document Chunk 4514 ---
specific and could include the train having received radio hole track condition 

--- Document Chunk 4515 ---
information from the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 4516 ---
Once a train is reporting in RV mode, it is not able to move forwards without performing 

--- Document Chunk 4517 ---
EoM, Start of Mission, so it is not necessary to extend the Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 4518 ---
Object to the end of the Reserved Status Area or MA. 

--- Document Chunk 4519 ---
The MBS will maintain the communication session with OBU as active even when the 

--- Document Chunk 4520 ---

Location extended to the end of the Movement Permission , except if the train was 

--- Document Chunk 4567 ---
reporting in RV mode. 

--- Document Chunk 4568 ---
 Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4569 ---
This is so that, even for applications not utilising the Mute timer functionality, the 

--- Document Chunk 4570 ---
Trackside is protected when communications with a train expire according to the 

--- Document Chunk 4571 ---
existing session expiry timer in the ETCS specifications [BL3 R2].  

--- Document Chunk 4572 ---
 Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4573 ---
Whether or not to use the Mute Timer will depend on whether it is required to detect 

--- Document Chunk 4574 ---
loss of communication before expiry of the session timer. This in turn will depend on 

--- Document Chunk 4575 ---
traffic density and the typical speed of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 4576 ---
Once a train is reporting in RV mode, it is not able to move forwards without performing 

--- Document Chunk 4577 ---
EoM and Start of Mission, so it is not necessary to extend the Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 4578 ---
Object to the end of the Movement Permission.

--- Document Chunk 4588 ---
For a system using TTD, there may be clear TTDs ahead of the train within the 

--- Document Chunk 4589 ---
Movement Permission. In this case, the Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be 

--- Document Chunk 4590 ---
extended to the least distant position of the next TTD that is clear. This is equivalent 

--- Document Chunk 4591 ---
to extending the Unresolved Trackbound Object up to the end of the MA, in accordance 

--- Document Chunk 4592 ---
with this requirement, and then clearing those parts in accordance with TTD 

--- Document Chunk 4593 ---
requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 4594 ---
Important note: this requirement assumes that the train is at standstill (or low speed) 

--- Document Chunk 4595 ---
when the session timer expires.

--- Document Chunk 4600 ---
REQ-0027   

--- Document Chunk 4601 ---
When receiving a position report from a train with the information ‘Train Integrity is 

--- Document Chunk 4602 ---
confirmed by External Source’, then the MBS shall mark the Train Object associated to 

--- Document Chunk 4603 ---
this train as “integrity confirmed”. 

--- Document Chunk 4604 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4605 ---
When the train is confirmed by External Source, the information about train integrity for 

--- Document Chunk 4606 ---
the Train Object needs to be updated.

When receiving a position report from a train with the information ‘Train integrity lost’, the 

--- Document Chunk 4613 ---
MBS shall mark the Train Object associated with this train as “integrity not confirmed”. 

--- Document Chunk 4614 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4615 ---
In this situation, the status for the Train Location of the train changes to integrity not 

--- Document Chunk 4616 ---
confirmed, while the extent of the Train Location is updated by other requirements, 

--- Document Chunk 4617 ---
changing the front end from the information in the position report while the rear end is

REQ-LossTI-7   

--- Document Chunk 4633 ---
If the MBS receives Validated Train Data for a train with a train length different from 

--- Document Chunk 4634 ---
previously reported within the same communication session, then the MBS shall mark the 

--- Document Chunk 4635 ---
Train Object as “integrity not confirmed”. 

--- Document Chunk 4636 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4637 ---
If the train reports loss of Train Integrity because of joining or splitting, then this will 

--- Document Chunk 4638 ---
already result in the Train Object marked as “integrity not confirmed”. This requirement 

--- Document Chunk 4639 ---
is to cover the situation where the new train length is received before the loss of Train 

--- Document Chunk 4640 ---
Integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 4641 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4642 ---
When new train data is entered, the OBU will not confirm Train Integrity until the new 

--- Document Chunk 4643 ---
train data is acknowledged by the MBS. This behaviour is as defined in Change

The MBS shall mark the Train Object as “integrity not confirmed ” when ‘No train integrity 

--- Document Chunk 4649 ---
information’ is reported longer than a configurable time (Integrity Wait Timer). 

--- Document Chunk 4650 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4651 ---
This is to provide to other consumers entity as P E the information about the train 

--- Document Chunk 4652 ---
integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 4653 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4654 ---
Once Train Integrity is considered Lost by the MBS, the mechanism in REQ-LossTI-2 

--- Document Chunk 4655 ---
is applied. 

--- Document Chunk 4656 ---
It is application specific whether to implement this function. The timer will have a 

--- Document Chunk 4657 ---
special value that means the function is disabled. 

--- Document Chunk 4658 ---
Note that using this timer the Driver will not be aware of the train Integrity being treated 

--- Document Chunk 4659 ---
as Lost by the MBS and as such cannot be expected to react in any manner.  

--- Document Chunk 4660 ---
If the MBS is configured not to accept Train Integrity confirmed by Driver, and Train 

--- Document Chunk 4661 ---
Integrity confirmed by Driver is reported, then the MBS will treat this as “No train 

--- Document Chunk 4662 ---
integrity information”.

Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4680 ---
This is for the MBS to implement an appropriate reaction in case a train does not send 

--- Document Chunk 4681 ---
a position report with integrity confirmed by external source within the configured time. 

--- Document Chunk 4682 ---
Guidance:

6.10  SYSF MANAGE UNRESOLVED TRACKBOUND OBJECT  

--- Document Chunk 4688 ---
6.10.1 Overview  

--- Document Chunk 4689 ---
The MBS must be aware of all parts of the track that are potentially occupied. 

--- Document Chunk 4690 ---
• For communicating trains that are localised, the occupancy is managed by the Train 

--- Document Chunk 4691 ---
Location inside Train Object. The MBS will create and update a Train Object for each 

--- Document Chunk 4692 ---
communicating train.  

--- Document Chunk 4693 ---
• For all other situations, the (potential) occupancy is managed by Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 4694 ---
Object. The MBS will create and update Unresolved Trackbound Object in these cases. 

--- Document Chunk 4695 ---
An Unresolved Trackbound Object  may exist for a specific train, but may also exist for another 

--- Document Chunk 4696 ---
reason, not associated with a specific train.

6.10.2 Propagation concept  

--- Document Chunk 4806 ---
The concept of propagation is based on the idea that an Unresolved Trackbound Object needs to 

--- Document Chunk 4807 ---
be increased, possibly after a period of time, to allow for the fact that any railway vehicles in the 

--- Document Chunk 4808 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object area may move without knowledge of the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 4809 ---
Within a signalling system with 100% Trackside Train Detection (TTD), any movement which crosses 

--- Document Chunk 4810 ---
a TTD boundary is likely to be detected (see REQ-TTD-9, REQ-TTD-10, REQ-TTD-12).  

--- Document Chunk 4811 ---
In case of loss of communication, the Movement Permission is also considered as a possible 

--- Document Chunk 4812 ---
envelope for movements of non-reporting vehicles (see REQ-TrainLoc-10). 

--- Document Chunk 4813 ---
Without TTD or if the TTD is already occupied, movements of non-reporting rail vehicles will not be 

--- Document Chunk 4814 ---
detected by the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 4815 ---
For stationary vehicles, the period of time before propagation is applied could be associated with the 

--- Document Chunk 4816 ---
length of time for which railway vehicle brakes can be expected to remain active, and so keep the 

--- Document Chunk 4817 ---
vehicle(s) stationary. 

--- Document Chunk 4818 ---
Measures are generally put in place at railway project level to prevent or detect and mitigate the risk 

--- Document Chunk 4819 ---
of rolling vehicles moving such that they conflict with other movements: 

--- Document Chunk 4820 ---
• Use of trap points or derailers in station areas and/or sidings 

--- Document Chunk 4821 ---
• Use of Trackside Train Detection in station areas and/or sidings 

--- Document Chunk 4822 ---
If hazard analysis on a particular railway identifies that the remaining risk of unexpected vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 4823 ---
movement causing a collision is still not acceptable, MBS includes a propagation algorithm within 

--- Document Chunk 4824 ---
TTD (see REQ-TrainLoc-14, REQ-TrainLoc-15 and REQ-TrainLoc-16) to mitigate this risk.

--- Document Chunk 4827 ---
If an Unresolved Trackbound Object  is created that is within a Movement Permission 

--- Document Chunk 4828 ---
allocated to a train, then the MBS shall react to transition the system to a safe state. 

--- Document Chunk 4829 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4830 ---
A new Unresolved Trackbound Object  within a Movement Permission allocated to a 

--- Document Chunk 4831 ---
train may require urgent action from the MBS in order to avoid a hazard. 

--- Document Chunk 4832 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4833 ---
The specific reaction applied will depend on the scenario and application specific 

--- Document Chunk 4834 ---

recovery after loss of communication, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 4874 ---
Stored Information can also aid with initialising the MBS after a restart. 

--- Document Chunk 4875 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4876 ---
The Train ID stored will be the NID_ENGINE of the train associated with the 

--- Document Chunk 4877 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object, if any.  

--- Document Chunk 4878 ---
There may be more than one reason for an Unresolved Trackbound Object.  

--- Document Chunk 4879 ---
Stored Data for Unresolved Trackbound Object can be used in the following situations: 

--- Document Chunk 4880 ---
a) Joining/Splitting: The Length of trains involved in Splitting and Joining is 

--- Document Chunk 4881 ---
recorded, and the MBS ensures that the full length is accounted for before and 

--- Document Chunk 4882 ---
after the procedure 

--- Document Chunk 4883 ---
b) Start of Mission: Comparing the new train length to the stored train length for an 

--- Document Chunk 4884 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object , and removing the Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 4885 ---
Object if the train lengths match 

--- Document Chunk 4886 ---
c) Recovery after loss of communication (new session): New train length received 

--- Document Chunk 4887 ---
is compared with that stored to check that it is the same train reconnecting. 

--- Document Chunk 4888 ---

--- Document Chunk 4902 ---
When at Start of Mission a Train Location has been created for a train with the min Safe 

--- Document Chunk 4903 ---
Front End located within an Unresolved Trackbound Object, then this Train Location shall 

--- Document Chunk 4904 ---
be associated with this Unresolved Trackbound Object  if the following conditions are 

--- Document Chunk 4905 ---
fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 4906 ---
• The min Safe Front End is located inside exactly one Unresolved Trackbound Object, 

--- Document Chunk 4907 ---
and  

--- Document Chunk 4908 ---
• There is a recorded train length for this Unresolved Trackbound Object, and 

--- Document Chunk 4909 ---
• The Unresolved Trackbound Object is not associated to any train. 

--- Document Chunk 4910 ---
Rationale:

Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4941 ---
The increase in the train length for the Train Location will be because the MBS has 

--- Document Chunk 4942 ---
received Validated Train Data with an increased value of L_TRAIN. 

--- Document Chunk 4943 ---
A train is expected to send Validated Train Data with an increased value of L_TRAIN 

--- Document Chunk 4944 ---
if it has performed a joining operation. In this case, there should be one or more 

--- Document Chunk 4945 ---
adjacent Unresolved Trackbound Object , where the additional Recorded Train 

--- Document Chunk 4946 ---
Length(s) can account for the increased train length. 

--- Document Chunk 4947 ---
If there are no adjacent Unresolved Trackbound Object  which can account for the 

--- Document Chunk 4948 ---
increased train length, then some error has occurred, and the TMS will be alerted. 

--- Document Chunk 4949 ---
An inconsistency in the reported length from a train and the length stored by the MBS 

--- Document Chunk 4950 ---
could be due to an error in the stored data, or failure in the application of Operational 

--- Document Chunk 4951 ---
Rules. The MBS may decide to take a protective reaction, such as extending an 

--- Document Chunk 4952 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object  to cover the Train Location. This reaction is project 

--- Document Chunk 4953 ---
specific.

--- Document Chunk 4964 ---
delete all UTOs matching the length of this train. 

--- Document Chunk 4965 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 4966 ---
The Unresolved Trackbound Object  is “replaced” by the Train Location of the Train 

--- Document Chunk 4967 ---
Object in this case. It is assumed that when a train confirms its train integrity then the 

--- Document Chunk 4968 ---
MBS can trust the length of this train (L_TRAIN). L_TRAIN matches the real length of 

--- Document Chunk 4969 ---
the train (considering stretching). 

--- Document Chunk 4970 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 4971 ---
The length of the train could be longer than what is recorded for the Unresolved 

--- Document Chunk 4972 ---
Trackbound Object in case two trains were joined after performing EoM and the joined 

--- Document Chunk 4973 ---
train is associated with one of two Unresolved Trackbound Object. 

--- Document Chunk 4974 ---
Projects may decide to allow for some tolerance in matching the length of a train with

Figure 33 shows the relationship between Train Location  and the associated

the length of the train is the same as that recorded for the Unresolved Trackbound

REQ-TrackStatus-25  

--- Document Chunk 5024 ---
When receiving Validated Train Data from a train indicating that the train length has been 

--- Document Chunk 5025 ---
decreased, then MBS shall, before applying REQ-TrackStatus-10 

--- Document Chunk 5026 ---
• create an Unresolved Trackbound Object from the rear of the Train Location  

--- Document Chunk 5027 ---
(considering the old train length) to the max safe rear end position of the train 

--- Document Chunk 5028 ---
(considering the new train length)  

--- Document Chunk 5029 ---
• associate the Unresolved Trackbound Object to this train 

--- Document Chunk 5030 ---
• store the old Train Length (L_TRAIN) in the created Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5031 ---
Object if the train is marked as integrity confirmed,  

--- Document Chunk 5032 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5033 ---
As the Train Location is shortened according to REQ -TrainLoc-6, it is necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 5034 ---
create an UTO to manage the remaining length of the train that is now unresolved. It 

--- Document Chunk 5035 ---
is assumed that when a train confirms its train integrity then the MBS can trust the 

--- Document Chunk 5036 ---
length of this train (L_TRAIN). L_TRAIN matches the real length of the train 

--- Document Chunk 5037 ---
(considering stretching). 

--- Document Chunk 5038 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5039 ---
If this is a changed value of L_TRAIN, then the new value of L_TRAIN could be shorter 

--- Document Chunk 5040 ---
than the previous value, for example after Splitting, as shown in Figure 34. 

--- Document Chunk 5041 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 5042 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 5043 ---
Figure 34: UTO creation when receiving Validated Train Data, L_TRAIN decreased 

--- Document Chunk 5044 ---
The created UTO will then be updated according to REQ -TrackStatus-10 (update of 

--- Document Chunk 5045 ---
the Recorded Length).

--- Document Chunk 5059 ---
When Train Integrity is confirmed by External Source for a train associated with an 

--- Document Chunk 5060 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object  and the length (L_TRAIN) of this train is less than the 

--- Document Chunk 5061 ---
Recorded Train Length, then the MBS shall: 

--- Document Chunk 5062 ---
• remove the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object  between the Min Safe Front 

--- Document Chunk 5063 ---
End to the Max Safe Rear End of the train  if the front ends do not overlap with the 

--- Document Chunk 5064 ---
rear ends, AND 

--- Document Chunk 5065 ---
• reduce the Recorded Train Length of the remaining Unresolved Trackbound Object 

--- Document Chunk 5066 ---
by the length of the train that confirmed Train Integrity, AND 

--- Document Chunk 5067 ---
• dissociate the Unresolved Trackbound Object from this train 

--- Document Chunk 5068 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5069 ---
This is required for the MBS to maintain the Unresolved Trackbound Object within its 

--- Document Chunk 5070 ---
Area of Control when all the train length recorded for an Unresolved Trackbound Object 

--- Document Chunk 5071 ---
is not accounted for by a train confirming integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 5072 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5073 ---
An Unresolved Trackbound Object cannot be fully recovered if the reported train length 

--- Document Chunk 5074 ---
does not account for all the train length recorded for that area. In this case, the 

--- Document Chunk 5075 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object must remain with the recorded train length reduced by 

--- Document Chunk 5076 ---
the length of the train that confirmed integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 5077 ---
The extent of the Unresolved Trackbound Object will also be reduced because the new 

--- Document Chunk 5078 ---
Train Location will sweep the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object from its Min 

--- Document Chunk 5079 ---
Safe Front End to the Max Safe Rear End. This could result in this area being split in 

--- Document Chunk 5080 ---
two, depending on the Train Location. In that case the recorded train length is the same 

--- Document Chunk 5081 ---
for both Unresolved Trackbound Object. 

--- Document Chunk 5082 ---
Figure 35 shows an example of a train accounting for part of the length recorded for 

--- Document Chunk 5083 ---
an Unresolved Trackbound Object after splitting and that area being split by the train 

--- Document Chunk 5084 ---
when it confirms integrity. Here, the Front Train After Splitting, train 1 in the figure, 

--- Document Chunk 5085 ---
confirms integrity and leaves before the rear part has performed SoM. As the train 

--- Document Chunk 5086 ---
moves away, it sweeps the p art of the Unresolved Trackbound Object at the front of 

--- Document Chunk 5087 ---
the train, while the overlapped part at the rear becomes visible.

Figure 35: Unresolved Trackbound Object remains when Front Train after Splitting leaves

The process above is repeated if another train performs Start of Mission in the 

--- Document Chunk 5101 ---
remaining Unresolved Trackbound Object. After splitting, any end could perform Start 

--- Document Chunk 5102 ---
of Mission first, but the handling is the same. 

--- Document Chunk 5103 ---
Projects may decide to allow for some tolerance in matching the length of a train with

what is recorded for the Unresolved Trackbound Object . In that case, the tolerance

can be the configurable minimum length of Unresolved Trackbound Object, as defined

--- Document Chunk 5107 ---
Additionally, projects may decide to additionally remove the UTO in front of the train in 

--- Document Chunk 5108 ---
case the MBS can unambiguously determine that there is no other (part of a) train in 

--- Document Chunk 5109 ---
front, e.g. by comparing the Train ID from the UTO with the Train ID from the train

--- Document Chunk 5131 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5132 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be split by a TTD section detected clear or by a

--- Document Chunk 5134 ---
could even be split in more than two parts. 

--- Document Chunk 5135 ---
If the split is due to a train which confirms integrity, this requirement is performed after 

--- Document Chunk 5136 ---
REQ-TrackStatus-10. 

--- Document Chunk 5137 ---
Even if the extents of the split areas are very different, the MBS cannot safely judge if 

--- Document Chunk 5138 ---
one of them should have more of the recorded length than the other and what that 

--- Document Chunk 5139 ---
length should be. This is the same situation as if an Unresolved Trackbound Object is

Sweeping is performed by the Min Safe Front End (mSFE) of a train, as it cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 5262 ---
guaranteed that there is no obstruction between the mSFE and the Max Safe Front 

--- Document Chunk 5263 ---
End (MSFE) which is the Confidence Interval where the front of the train can be. 

--- Document Chunk 5264 ---
A hazardous situation may arise if an Unresolved Trackbound Object  is swept by a 

--- Document Chunk 5265 ---
train if this Unresolved Trackbound Object was created only after the train had passed 

--- Document Chunk 5266 ---
it. 

--- Document Chunk 5267 ---
Figure 39 below shows a train having passed a Sweepable Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5268 ---
Object between a new and the previous Train Location. As the area did not exist before 

--- Document Chunk 5269 ---
the Train Location was updated, it only sweeps that Unresolved Trackbound Object 

--- Document Chunk 5270 ---
from the new min Safe Front End and the new Max Safe Rear End of the train.

REQ-TrackStatus-16 FOR FURTHER RELEASE [X2R5 REQ-TrackStatus-16] 

--- Document Chunk 5296 ---
When the MBS considers the communication session with a train is terminated, the MBS 

--- Document Chunk 5297 ---
shall convert the Train Location to an Unresolved Trackbound Object, except if the train 

--- Document Chunk 5298 ---
is completely located inside an Active Shunting Area. 

--- Document Chunk 5299 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5300 ---
This is the area where the train could be located, and as such needs to be protected 

--- Document Chunk 5301 ---
by an Unresolved Trackbound Object.  

--- Document Chunk 5302 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5303 ---
This requirement applies at EoM for trains not inside an Active Shunting Area.  

--- Document Chunk 5304 ---
For a train located completely inside an Active Shunting Area, there is no need for an 

--- Document Chunk 5305 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object  since there is already an Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5306 ---
Object associated with the Active Shunting Area which will protect the train. 

--- Document Chunk 5307 ---
If a train is partially located inside an Active Shunting Area, it is project specific whether 

--- Document Chunk 5308 ---
the MBS authorises the transition to Shunting Mode. Similarly, it is project specific how 

--- Document Chunk 5309 ---
the MBS subsequently manages the overlapping Unresolved Trackbound Object that 

--- Document Chunk 5310 ---
is created for the location of this train.  

--- Document Chunk 5311 ---
For a train leaving the MBS Area, another requirement deals with the relevant 

--- Document Chunk 5312 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object that could be removed when the train has left the area, 

--- Document Chunk 5313 ---
i.e. before the communication session has been terminated. 

--- Document Chunk 5314 ---
Loss of communications is handled by other requirements.

6.10.5 Removing an Unresolved Trackbound Object

REQ-TrackStatus-19   

--- Document Chunk 5319 ---
The MBS shall automatically remove Unresolved Trackbound Object for which the extent 

--- Document Chunk 5320 ---
is less than or equal to a configurable minimum length. 

--- Document Chunk 5321 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5322 ---
This is to avoid having small Unresolved Trackbound Object  that have to be swept 

--- Document Chunk 5323 ---
when it is known that there cannot be a vehicle inside them.  

--- Document Chunk 5324 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5325 ---
Small Unresolved Trackbound Object could arise from splitting and joining procedures, 

--- Document Chunk 5326 ---
or from sweeping.

For example, this requirement could apply to cross-over areas, as in Figure 40: 

--- Document Chunk 5337 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 5338 ---
Figure 40: Short Unresolved Trackbound Object at crossover 

--- Document Chunk 5339 ---
The configurable minimum length could be related to the length of the shortest vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 5340 ---
that could be running on the line. The Unresolved Trackbound Object can be removed, 

--- Document Chunk 5341 ---
regardless of the status of adjacent areas. 

--- Document Chunk 5342 ---
In case an Unresolved Trackbound Object is split in two, e.g. by a clear TTD section, 

--- Document Chunk 5343 ---
and if one of these areas is shorter than the configured minimum distance, then it can 

--- Document Chunk 5344 ---
be removed even if it has a Recorded Train Length because that length is also 

--- Document Chunk 5345 ---
recorded in the other area. Thus, there is n o risk of trains and/or waggons becoming 

--- Document Chunk 5346 ---
lost.

REQ-TTD-7

For a system using TTD, the MBS shall remove all or part of a Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5352 ---
Object, corresponding to a TTD section which is Clear. 

--- Document Chunk 5353 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5354 ---
TTD information can be used to clear the track under degraded situations. 

--- Document Chunk 5355 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5356 ---
TTD can assist with recovery as there is no need to sweep clear TTD sections. 

--- Document Chunk 5357 ---
Only the part of the Unresolved Trackbound Object corresponding to the Clear TTD 

--- Document Chunk 5358 ---
section can be removed according to this requirement. This might mean that part of

REQ-TTD-8

For a system using TTD, if the MBS has shortened the extent of an Unresolved

Trackbound Object , then the MBS shall ensure the resulting Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5374 ---
Object is not shorter than the Recorded Train Length stored for it.  

--- Document Chunk 5375 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5376 ---
Applying shortening could result in the extent of the remaining Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5377 ---
Object being less than the Recorded Train Length. 

--- Document Chunk 5378 ---
An Unresolved Trackbound Object with an extent shorter than the stored train length 

--- Document Chunk 5379 ---
could represent a hazard. 

--- Document Chunk 5380 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5381 ---
When the application of shortening the Unresolved Trackbound Object results in the 

--- Document Chunk 5382 ---
length of the Unresolved Trackbound Object being less than Recorded Train Length, 

--- Document Chunk 5383 ---
it is project specific what alternative action the MBS takes. For example, an application 

--- Document Chunk 5384 ---
may decide to not apply any shortening to the Unresolved Trackbound Object , or to 

--- Document Chunk 5385 ---
apply equal shortening to the front and rear whilst maintaining the length of the 

--- Document Chunk 5386 ---
Recorded Train Length. 

--- Document Chunk 5387 ---
If an Unresolved Trackbound Object is one part of an Unresolved Trackbound Object 

--- Document Chunk 5388 ---
which has been split, for example by a clear TTD, then project -specific rules may be 

--- Document Chunk 5389 ---

For a system using TTD, when detecting a TTD occupancy not associated with any

expected train movement,  the MBS shall create a Unresolved Trackbound Object

for that TTD section (if there is not UTO to be extended from the next TTD according

Rationale:

Guidance:

Unexpected TTD occupancy also includes a TTD remaining Occupied when it might

extend the Unresolved Trackbound Object up to the next boundary of this TTD section.

Rationale:

A TTD occupancy not associated with any expected train movement should be

considered a potential hazard. 

--- Document Chunk 5433 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5434 ---
A train which is not communicating can move and occupy a previously clear TTD. That

occupation can be attributed to the train in the adjacent TTD. The MBS can adjust the

For a system using TTD, on request from the TMS, the MBS shall be able to remove an 

--- Document Chunk 5458 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object caused by a faulty TTD. 

--- Document Chunk 5459 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5460 ---
This will allow the MBS to help restore normal operation on the line. 

--- Document Chunk 5461 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5462 ---
This function could be used to improve the reliability of the system and overrule false 

--- Document Chunk 5463 ---
occupation reported by TTD (e.g. malfunctioning axle counters). 

--- Document Chunk 5464 ---
In MBS operations, when all train movements are supervised by OBU with train 

--- Document Chunk 5465 ---
position reporting and train integrity confirmation, a faulty TTD could be detected, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 5466 ---
dependent on the states of the neighbouring TTDs and position reports. 

--- Document Chunk 5467 ---
The implementation of this requirement will need to prevent a new Unresolved

For a system using TTD, when detecting a TTD clearance which cannot be associated

with any regular train movement or Train Location, the MBS shall create an Unresolved 

--- Document Chunk 5474 ---
Trackbound Object for each adjacent area if the adjacent area is not completely covered 

--- Document Chunk 5475 ---
by UTO, or is known as cleared (by TTD if available).  

--- Document Chunk 5476 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5477 ---
A TTD clearance which cannot be associated with any regular train movement or Train 

--- Document Chunk 5478 ---
Location, should be considered a potential hazard, as such the MBS needs to protect 

--- Document Chunk 5479 ---
other train movements by either creating or extending Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5480 ---
Objects. 

--- Document Chunk 5481 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5482 ---
A TTD becoming unexpectedly clear might be due to several reasons. For example, a 

--- Document Chunk 5483 ---
non-communicating train is moved such that the TTD becomes clear. 

--- Document Chunk 5484 ---
The MBS must react, for example by creating an additional Unresolved Trackbound

Objects to protect the movement of trains.

Rationale:

REQ-TrackStatus-22  [X2R5 REQ-TrackStatus-22] 

--- Document Chunk 5608 ---
On request from the PE/Operator panel, the MBS shall create an Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5609 ---
Object flagged as Sweepable provided the area is longer than the configurable minimum 

--- Document Chunk 5610 ---
length.  

--- Document Chunk 5611 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5612 ---
This is to allow the MBS to have all relevant information concerning obstructions. 

--- Document Chunk 5613 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5614 ---
For example, this can be used in the degraded situation of a non-communicating train. 

--- Document Chunk 5615 ---
A train without communications has to be moved inside an Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5616 ---
Object, so that the MBS is aware that this area is protected for a specific train. 

--- Document Chunk 5617 ---
The Unresolved Trackbound Object may be created automatically by the TMS, or via 

--- Document Chunk 5618 ---
dispatcher interaction with the TMS or Operator Panel.  

--- Document Chunk 5619 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object can be created independently. 

--- Document Chunk 5620 ---
The Sweepable Unresolved Trackbound Object  needs to be longer than the 

--- Document Chunk 5621 ---
configurable minimum length for removal of Unresolved Trackbound Object, as defined 

--- Document Chunk 5622 ---
in ENG-Generic-3.

REQ-TrackStatus-23  [X2R5 REQ-TrackStatus-23] 

--- Document Chunk 5636 ---
On request from the PE/Operator Panel, the MBS shall create an Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5637 ---
Object flagged as Non-Sweepable.  

--- Document Chunk 5638 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5639 ---
When the PE/Operator Panel requests a Non -Sweepable Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5640 ---
Object, it may be for a reason that would make it unsuitable to be swept e.g. a known 

--- Document Chunk 5641 ---
permanent obstacle on the line. 

--- Document Chunk 5642 ---
Guidance:  

--- Document Chunk 5643 ---
Non-Sweepable Unresolved Trackbound Object will only be cleared at the request of 

--- Document Chunk 5644 ---
the TMS. The MBS will retain a Non -Sweepable Unresolved Trackbound Object after 

--- Document Chunk 5645 ---
traversal by a train which has confirmed Train Integrity. 

--- Document Chunk 5646 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object  can be created independently, i.e. they can overlap 

--- Document Chunk 5647 ---
existing Unresolved Trackbound Object or Train Location.  

--- Document Chunk 5648 ---
For example, creating Unresolved Trackbound Object  in parts of the track might be 

--- Document Chunk 5649 ---
due to external systems detecting fallen objects, or landslides.

REQ-TrackStatus-24  [X2R5 REQ-TrackStatus-24] 

--- Document Chunk 5654 ---
On request from the PE/Operator Panel, the MBS shall remove, reduce or extend 

--- Document Chunk 5655 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object. 

--- Document Chunk 5656 ---
Rationale: 

--- Document Chunk 5657 ---
MBS must allow the TMS to remove, reduce or extend Unresolved Trackbound Object 

--- Document Chunk 5658 ---
based on the result of operational procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 5659 ---
Guidance: 

--- Document Chunk 5660 ---
An Unresolved Trackbound Object , both Sweepable and Non -Sweepable, can be 

--- Document Chunk 5661 ---
removed, reduced or extended by the PE/Operator Panel. 

--- Document Chunk 5662 ---
For example, some Infrastructure Managers may permit Unresolved Trackbound 

--- Document Chunk 5663 ---
Object to be removed or reduced based on the observations of a Driver sweeping on 

--- Document Chunk 5664 ---
an adjacent line. 

--- Document Chunk 5665 ---
Projects may, if providing the necessary information, allow the Dispatcher via 

--- Document Chunk 5666 ---
PE/Operator Panel to remove or reduce parts of an Unresolved Trackbound Object , 

--- Document Chunk 5667 ---
e.g. by stating a certain length to be removed. 

--- Document Chunk 5668 ---
In case there is a train length stored for an Unresolved Trackbound Object requested 

--- Document Chunk 5669 ---
for removal, it is recommended that the MBS prevents removing this Unresolved 

--- Document Chunk 5670 ---
Trackbound Object unless the removal is supported by some additional measure(s).

Robust operational procedures are required in order to permit the Dispatcher, via the 

--- Document Chunk 5681 ---
PE/Operator Panel, to remove or reduce Unresolved Trackbound Object. 

--- Document Chunk 5682 ---
In case of overlapping Unresolved Trackbound Object conditions might be considered 

--- Document Chunk 5683 ---
when removing an Unresolved Trackbound Object. 

--- Document Chunk 5684 ---
If the Unresolved Trackbound Object  is Sweepable, the MBS will remove it if it is 

--- Document Chunk 5685 ---
reduced to a length shorter than the configurable minimum length for removal of 

--- Document Chunk 5686 ---
Unresolved Trackbound Object, as defined in ENG-Generic-3.

6.11 SYSF AUTHORISE MP REQUEST 

--- Document Chunk 5700 ---
6.11.1 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 5701 ---
This function is responsible to assess the safety of a request to alter the Authorisation of a Train 

--- Document Chunk 5702 ---
Object. PE or the operator through the operator panel can request an Authorisation through the SCI-

--- Document Chunk 5703 ---
CMD interface which is then checked by MBS if it violates any safety constraint. The MBS shall not 

--- Document Chunk 5704 ---
alter the request if certain parameters are incorrect (e.g. The operating state has changed during the 

--- Document Chunk 5705 ---
message transmission between PE and MBS) but only report the failure to PE with the failure reason. 

--- Document Chunk 5706 ---
The MP Request shall contain the following information: 

--- Document Chunk 5707 ---
- Train Object Identifier 

--- Document Chunk 5708 ---
- Movement Permission 

--- Document Chunk 5709 ---
The Movement Permission shall have the following attributes 

--- Document Chunk 5710 ---
- Risk Buffer (LinkedPath) 

--- Document Chunk 5711 ---
- Extent (LinkedPath) 

--- Document Chunk 5712 ---
- Requested Maximum Speed in km/h (LinkedPath per different speed) 

--- Document Chunk 5713 ---
- ETCS Movement Mode (Linked Path per different mode) 

--- Document Chunk 5714 ---
- List of DPS Groups that must not be used as flank protection measure  

--- Document Chunk 5715 ---
6.11.1.1 Flank Protection Overview 

--- Document Chunk 5716 ---
Before authorizing an MP request, MBS evaluates if sufficient protections to limit the risk of side-on 

--- Document Chunk 5717 ---
collision according to the safety analysis are in observed between the requested MP and any 

--- Document Chunk 5718 ---
uncontrolled trackbound movement. 

--- Document Chunk 5719 ---
To find the flank protecting measures applicable to the MP request, MBS builds Risk Path 

--- Document Chunk 5720 ---
Candidates that span from the end of the Allocation Sections up to the corresponding elements 

--- Document Chunk 5721 ---
providing (or not) flank protection (see requirement REQ-RP_SEARCH). 

--- Document Chunk 5722 ---
Note: once a risk path has been created, it may also be updated/deleted without the reception of a 

--- Document Chunk 5723 ---
new MP request (e.g. when a train is moving) through a continuous evaluation (see chapter 6.18). 

--- Document Chunk 5724 ---
For each Risk Path Candidate that has been built (according to REQ-SC_RP_SEARCH), the MBS 

--- Document Chunk 5725 ---
evaluates if the Risk Path is correctly terminated (according to REQ-SC_RP_TERM) on an 

--- Document Chunk 5726 ---
element authorised to provide flank protection. 

--- Document Chunk 5727 ---
The elements than can provide flank protections include: 

--- Document Chunk 5728 ---
• Switchable Track element  

--- Document Chunk 5729 ---
Examples: point from trailing side, derailer/catch point, end of track, etc. 

--- Document Chunk 5730 ---
The position of these points ensures that any uncontrolled trackbound movement 

--- Document Chunk 5731 ---
approaching the side of the Movement Permission will be deviated or derailed.  

--- Document Chunk 5732 ---

--- Document Chunk 5741 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 5742 ---
The side of the Movement Permission is protected by another train supervised by a 

--- Document Chunk 5743 ---
Movement Permission. As the ETCS on-board unit of the other train supervises the train 

--- Document Chunk 5744 ---
movement, this reduces the risk that the train will exceed its authority to an extent that 

--- Document Chunk 5745 ---
could result in a flank collision 

--- Document Chunk 5746 ---
• Train Object 

--- Document Chunk 5747 ---
The side of the Movement Permission is protected by another connected train. If the on-

--- Document Chunk 5748 ---
board unit guarantees that the train will not move without any authority, it is ensured that 

--- Document Chunk 5749 ---
this train will not perform any movements that could result in a flank collision.  

--- Document Chunk 5750 ---
• Protection by a sufficient distance 

--- Document Chunk 5751 ---
The side of the Movement Permission is detected as free over a sufficient distance to 

--- Document Chunk 5752 ---
mitigate the risk a flank collision to an acceptable level. 

--- Document Chunk 5753 ---
• Protection by Operational Rules 

--- Document Chunk 5754 ---
If the risk of flank collision cannot be mitigated by the preceding measures, the final 

--- Document Chunk 5755 ---
option is to reduce the potential consequences of a flank collision if Operational Rules 

--- Document Chunk 5756 ---
(vehicle should not be moved without permission) are violated. 

--- Document Chunk 5757 ---
This imposes a reduced speed.

The interface between MBS and PE is impacted by the flank protection as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 5894 ---
• For each granted Movement Permission, the MBS provides to PE the Risk Path as part of 

--- Document Chunk 5895 ---
the Movement Permission.  

--- Document Chunk 5896 ---
• When requesting a Movement Permission, the PE is able to optionally provide a list of 

--- Document Chunk 5897 ---
DPS that must not be used as flank protection measure.

6.11.1.2 Application Example 

--- Document Chunk 5901 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 5902 ---
In the example above the maximum speed for TE3 and TE2 is equal, it is different for TE3 and 

--- Document Chunk 5903 ---
TE4. The whole train running path of TO1 is split in three segments. The split between TE4 and 

--- Document Chunk 5904 ---
TE3 would be due to the change in maximum speed. The split in TE2 is due to the mode change 

--- Document Chunk 5905 ---
from FS to OS. 

--- Document Chunk 5906 ---
Note: the example is not exhaustive and does not show all possible starting conditions and 

--- Document Chunk 5907 ---
terminations of a risk path (e.g. risk path termination by Train Object, risk path starting at a 

--- Document Chunk 5908 ---
diamond crossing).

performed safety check fails and send a request rejected message. 

--- Document Chunk 6049 ---
Rationale:   A safety check could require the correct execution of a previous

safety check.  

--- Document Chunk 6051 ---
Guidance:    If a check discovers a mismatch between the topology in PE and

--- Document Chunk 6219 ---
Permission and if the check fails, the MBS shall send a “SPEED_LOWER” rejection code. 

--- Document Chunk 6220 ---
Rationale:   If the speed in the new MP is lower than in the currently active 

--- Document Chunk 6221 ---
MP, it is not guaranteed that the train is able to brake. Thus, MBS rejects the MP request 

--- Document Chunk 6222 ---

Points and derailers provide flank protection by means that no train can physically 

--- Document Chunk 6921 ---
move towards the flank protection seeking element, if the path is set away from the 

--- Document Chunk 6922 ---
side that needs protection (Check for FULL/NONE). In some cases, the abstracted 

--- Document Chunk 6923 ---
DPS cannot physically provide flank protection (config variable flankProtection). For 

--- Document Chunk 6924 ---
derailers a regulation exists (for example in Switzerland) that they must not be used if 

--- Document Chunk 6925 ---
the speed of the to be protected train is higher than 120 km/h (variable

maxFlankProtectionSpeed).

Guidance:    

--- Document Chunk 6928 ---
The termination of the Risk Path was chosen to be the “inner end” of the DPS to have 

--- Document Chunk 6929 ---
a) a clear point to terminate, b) be able to perform an overlap check if the DPSG is 

--- Document Chunk 6930 ---
allowed to move or locked as it serves as a flank protection element and c) to 

--- Document Chunk 6931 ---
distinguish the cases of a DPSG where i t is used as a flank protection measure (and 

--- Document Chunk 6932 ---
thus not able to move) from being in the flank protection area (and thus allowed to 

--- Document Chunk 6933 ---
move).

• The attribute rpTermAtDpsOnly is FALSE for the Allocation section the Risk Path

--- Document Chunk 7050 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 7051 ---
Rationale:   A parked vehicle not reporting to the MBS is not expected to

enough. 

--- Document Chunk 7054 ---
Guidance:

• The end of the Risk Path equals the end of a Track Edge 

--- Document Chunk 7065 ---
• The Track Edge has no Track Edge Links 

--- Document Chunk 7066 ---
Rationale:  If the stretch between the Allocation Section and the track net is free of

6.12 AUTHORISE COOPERATIVE SHORTENING REQUEST 

--- Document Chunk 7166 ---
6.12.1 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 7167 ---
This function is responsible to assess the safety of a request to co-operatively shorten the Movement 

--- Document Chunk 7168 ---
Authority of a train. The MBS shall not alter the request if certain parameters are incorrect but only 

--- Document Chunk 7169 ---
report the failure to PE with the failure reason. 

--- Document Chunk 7170 ---
The Cooperative Shortening Request shall contain the following information: 

--- Document Chunk 7171 ---
- Train Object Identifier 

--- Document Chunk 7172 ---
- Requested Stop Location 

--- Document Chunk 7173 ---
- Risk Buffer (LinkedPath) 

--- Document Chunk 7174 ---

REQ-SAFETY-COOPERATIVE 

--- Document Chunk 7191 ---
The MBS shall perform a series of checks given by the following ordered list when it 

--- Document Chunk 7192 ---
receives a Cooperative Shortening Request indicating a request to co-operatively shorten 

--- Document Chunk 7193 ---
an MA through I_PE: 

--- Document Chunk 7194 ---
1. REQ-SYNTAX (see ‘Authorise MP Request’)

--- Document Chunk 7201 ---
8. REQ-COOP_RISK_BUFFER 

--- Document Chunk 7202 ---
9. REQ-COOP_PENDING 

--- Document Chunk 7203 ---
Rationale: The request to allow a train movement shall be safeguarded.

The MBS shall abort checking a Cooperative Shortening Request received through I_PE 

--- Document Chunk 7209 ---
if any performed safety check fails and send a “REQUEST_REJECTED” reply. 

--- Document Chunk 7210 ---
Rationale:   A safety check could require the correct execution of a previous

Request exists and if the check fails, the MBS shall send a 

--- Document Chunk 7234 ---
“COOP_TO_NOT_EXISTENT” reject code.

The MBS shall check that the mode of the train is either FS or OS and if the check fails, 

--- Document Chunk 7242 ---
the MBS shall send a “COOP_INVALID_MODE” reject code. 

--- Document Chunk 7243 ---
Rationale:   The OBU does not accept a Request to Shorten MA message in 

--- Document Chunk 7244 ---
other modes (supported by the MBS) according to chapter 4.8.4 (/ETCS/).  

--- Document Chunk 7245 ---
Guidance:   According to chapter 4.8.4 (/ETCS/), an OBU would also accept 

--- Document Chunk 7246 ---
a Request to Shorten MA message in the modes LS and AD, but those modes are 

--- Document Chunk 7247 ---
not in scope of the System Specification of the MBS yet.

--- Document Chunk 7252 ---
Request is located within the currently stored Movement Permission and if the check fails, 

--- Document Chunk 7253 ---
the MBS shall send a COOP_NOT_IN_REAR reject code.  

--- Document Chunk 7254 ---
Rationale:   According to chapter 4.8.4 (ETCS/), MBS should propose a 

--- Document Chunk 7255 ---
shortened MA with an EOA closer to the train than the current EOA/LOA.

REQ-COOP_RISK_BUFFER 

--- Document Chunk 7281 ---
The MBS shall perform all checks related to the Risk Buffer contained in the Cooperative 

--- Document Chunk 7282 ---
Shortening Request of the function ‘Authorise MP Request’ and if one of the check fails, 

--- Document Chunk 7283 ---
the MBS shall send the corresponding reject code.  

--- Document Chunk 7284 ---
Rationale:   The Cooperative Shortening Request can contain a Risk Buffer 

--- Document Chunk 7285 ---
and therefore the (safety) checks for the Risk Buffer have to be performed.

train in the Cooperative Shortening Request and if the check fails, the MBS shall send a 

--- Document Chunk 7292 ---
“COOP_PENDING” reject code.   

--- Document Chunk 7293 ---
Rationale:   It is considered as unlikely that PE would trigger several co -

--- Document Chunk 7294 ---
operative shortenings at the same time for one train. Thus, when MBS would allow 

--- Document Chunk 7295 ---
this, this would unnecessarily the complexity of the MBS system.

REQ-0048  

--- Document Chunk 7332 ---
When a valid Movement Permission is received, the MBS shall translate the Movement 

--- Document Chunk 7333 ---
Permission into a Movement Authority. 

--- Document Chunk 7334 ---
Rationale:   The MA is supplied to the on-board to allow the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 7335 ---
equipment to control the train movement. The Movement Permission has to be 

--- Document Chunk 7336 ---
supplied to the OBU as a Movement Authority in compliance with the interface I_OBU.

--- Document Chunk 7341 ---
The End of Movement Authority shall be the location at the end of the Movement 

--- Document Chunk 7342 ---
Permission Extent. 

--- Document Chunk 7343 ---
Rationale:   The End of Movement Authority is the target of the Movement

If a Risk Buffer is present in the Movement Permission, the Danger Point of the Movement 

--- Document Chunk 7356 ---
Authority shall be a location at a fixed distance (safe margin) in rear of the end of the Risk 

--- Document Chunk 7357 ---
Buffer. 

--- Document Chunk 7358 ---
Rationale:   The danger point is the Supervised Location that the train shall

not overpass. A safe margin is nevertheless added to consider some degraded 

--- Document Chunk 7360 ---
cases (see Guidance).

--- Document Chunk 7368 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 7369 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 7370 ---
Guidance:   The safe margin (defined at Project Level) considers that it is not 

--- Document Chunk 7371 ---
always guaranteed that the train stops in rear of the Danger Point if certain 

--- Document Chunk 7372 ---
assumptions are not fulfilled e.g.: 

--- Document Chunk 7373 ---
- That the available wheel-rail adhesion is better than or equal to that assumed in the 

--- Document Chunk 7374 ---
ETCS braking curve calculation.  

--- Document Chunk 7375 ---
- That the train does not accelerate on approach to the EOA (release speed 

--- Document Chunk 7376 ---
calculation assumes no acceleration). 

--- Document Chunk 7377 ---
- That the compensation of speed measurement inaccuracy is not inhibited by 

--- Document Chunk 7378 ---
national value.  

--- Document Chunk 7379 ---
If any of these assumptions are not true, then the SvL protection is not guaranteed by the 

--- Document Chunk 7380 ---
ETCS OBU. The safe margin provides a mitigation in case any of these assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 7381 ---
is not fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 7382 ---
The safe margin also considers the risk associated with the potential rollback of a chased 

--- Document Chunk 7383 ---
train and the train overhang (between the TTD border and the physical train end).

If a danger point is defined, the release speed shall be calculated (Project Specific) based 

--- Document Chunk 7389 ---
on the information contained in the Movement Permission.  

--- Document Chunk 7390 ---
Rationale:   The release speed as such is an operational decision. 

--- Document Chunk 7391 ---
Guidance:   The release speed value impacts the length of the associated 

--- Document Chunk 7392 ---
Risk Buffer. 

--- Document Chunk 7393 ---
For example, based on the Project decision, the Release speed can be: 

--- Document Chunk 7394 ---
• Set to 0 or to the specific value «calculated on board».

• Set to a value dependent on the Risk Buffer length and/or the train category.

--- Document Chunk 7624 ---
Guidance:

This applies to both Handovers and Transitions. 

--- Document Chunk 7626 ---
How the removal is achieved is project specific. Options include: 

--- Document Chunk 7627 ---
• Monitoring the Train Location for a train which is leaving the Area of Control, 

--- Document Chunk 7628 ---
until it is completely beyond the boundary of the Area of Control.

6.16 SYSF REQUEST MOVEMENT PERMISSION 

--- Document Chunk 7650 ---
6.16.1 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 7651 ---
When the MBS receives an MA Request message, then the OBU indicates that e.g., the driver has 

--- Document Chunk 7652 ---
pressed the start button or that the time before reaching perturbation location is reached. In the first 

--- Document Chunk 7653 ---
case, this additionally indicates that both the OBU and the driver are ready to accept authorisations 

--- Document Chunk 7654 ---
(e.g. Movement Authority or SR Authorisation).). 

--- Document Chunk 7655 ---
Therefore, the MBS shall forward each MA Request message received from OBU to the PE by

--- Document Chunk 7665 ---
request (e.g. driver has pressed the start button)  

--- Document Chunk 7666 ---

When MBS receives a “Request to Shorten MA is granted” message, then MBS shall 

--- Document Chunk 7749 ---
modify the Movement Permission so that the end of the Movement Permission Extent 

--- Document Chunk 7750 ---
equals the requested stop location and the Risk Buffer corresponds to the one received in 

--- Document Chunk 7751 ---
the Cooperative Shortening Request, and subsequently informs PE by sending the 

--- Document Chunk 7752 ---
“Cooperative MP Request Granted” message. 

--- Document Chunk 7753 ---
Rationale: When MBS has received the “Request to shorten MA is granted” message, 

--- Document Chunk 7754 ---
then this implies that the train has accepted the new MA. Thus, the old part of the 

--- Document Chunk 7755 ---
MA won’t be used by the train anymore and hence can be used for other train 

--- Document Chunk 7756 ---
movements (e.g. for joining purposes)

7 INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 7892 ---
7.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL INTERFACE I_TACS 

--- Document Chunk 7893 ---
7.1.1 Role of the external interface 

--- Document Chunk 7894 ---
The interface I_TACS allows the Moving Block System: 

--- Document Chunk 7895 ---
• to send commands to the TACS to move switchable TAs to the required state, and  

--- Document Chunk 7896 ---
• to receive from the TACS the state of the TA. 

--- Document Chunk 7897 ---
Indeed, to enable a train run from A to B, the Moving Block System commands to the TACS the 

--- Document Chunk 7898 ---
setting of the TA to the required state to allow the movement of the train from A to B.  

--- Document Chunk 7899 ---
To manage the train positioning and the movement of the trains, the Moving Block System also 

--- Document Chunk 7900 ---
needs to acquire through the TACS the state of all the TA inside its Area of Control (AoC.) 

--- Document Chunk 7901 ---
The interface I_TACS covers the following interfaces defined in EULYNX: 

--- Document Chunk 7902 ---
• Subsystem – Train Detection System (SCI-TDS) if TTD is used 

--- Document Chunk 7903 ---
• Subsystem – Point (SCI-P)

7.4 DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTERNAL INTERFACE I_DR 

--- Document Chunk 8074 ---
7.4.1 Role of the external interface 

--- Document Chunk 8075 ---
By this interface, MBS gets the static Topology Data. This is the case both at startup and during run-

--- Document Chunk 8076 ---
time where there is the possibility to update existing Topology Data to a new version. Particularly it 

--- Document Chunk 8077 ---
is possible to exchange a part of existing Topology Data e.g. as result of construction work. 

--- Document Chunk 8078 ---
7.4.2 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 8079 ---
Until release 4, Topology Data will cover the whole Area of Control  and will immediately be valid 

--- Document Chunk 8080 ---
(activated) after reception.

In a further release, Topology Data can cover an arbitrary part of the Area of Control and follow a 

--- Document Chunk 8091 ---
lifecycle: 

--- Document Chunk 8092 ---
• First, they will be distributed (pre-loaded) 

--- Document Chunk 8093 ---
• Then, MBS will be asked for authorisation of the Topology Data activation where it checks 

--- Document Chunk 8094 ---
for conflicting Movement Permission s and if there is no conflict, establishes a Usage 

--- Document Chunk 8095 ---
Restriction Area to keep the updated area free of future Movement Permissions until the 

--- Document Chunk 8096 ---
activation is finished 

--- Document Chunk 8097 ---
• Then, Topology Data become pre-activated and MBS can start to synchronise with the TACS 

--- Document Chunk 8098 ---
(of changed or new Trackside Assets) 

--- Document Chunk 8099 ---
• Finally, MBS is asked for activation, removes the Usage Restriction Area and uses the new 

--- Document Chunk 8100 ---
data from now on

--- Document Chunk 8113 ---
areas are fixed (pre -configured) but it shall be achieved that any sub -area, which cannot be pre -

--- Document Chunk 8114 ---
defined, shall be updateable. Until clarification it is used below, but the inherent future meaning shall 

--- Document Chunk 8115 ---
be that the Topology Data themselves (parameter requestedDomainData are such that they allow 

--- Document Chunk 8116 ---
identification of what sub-area they are replacing; the DomainId would then not be needed anymore. 

--- Document Chunk 8117 ---
Hint: for the mismatch of Topology Data and Domain Data (reflected in message names below) see 

--- Document Chunk 8118 ---

Only when it is discarded?

Shouldn't all the messages 

--- Document Chunk 8275 ---
be logged to the 

--- Document Chunk 8276 ---
Diagnostic system? 

--- Document Chunk 8277 ---
TBD. I agree. Perhaps it 

--- Document Chunk 8278 ---
would be better to 

--- Document Chunk 8279 ---
consider an alarm (instead 

--- Document Chunk 8280 ---
of event) in this case. This 

--- Document Chunk 8281 ---
is in line with the 

--- Document Chunk 8282 ---
comment of Bettina here 

--- Document Chunk 8283 ---
after. This should be 

--- Document Chunk 8284 ---

GLOSSARY 

--- Document Chunk 8655 ---
Check: General procedure which ascertains if certain conditions hold (e.g., [check if] each end of a 

--- Document Chunk 8656 ---
railway point is connected to a track section). 

--- Document Chunk 8657 ---
Configuration Data:  Further information relevant for system operation that is not contained in 

--- Document Chunk 8658 ---
topology, topography or infrastructure data (e.g., identifiers & connection parameters for object 

--- Document Chunk 8659 ---
controllers and parameters for safety checks.) 

--- Document Chunk 8660 ---
Static Speed Profile: A static speed profile that is dynamically calculated by MBS and subsequently 

--- Document Chunk 8661 ---
provided to the relevant train onboard unit. 

--- Document Chunk 8662 ---
Hazard: A hazard is defined as “a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular 

--- Document Chunk 8663 ---
set of worst-case environmental conditions, will lead to a loss” [1]. 

--- Document Chunk 8664 ---
Infrastructure data:   Additional information not contained in the topography but necessary for 

--- Document Chunk 8665 ---
physical train operations (e.g., static speed profiles, cant, ...) 

--- Document Chunk 8666 ---
Loss:  Within STPA, a loss is defined as an unacceptable event which harms “something of value 

--- Document Chunk 8667 ---
to stakeholders.” [1]. Typical values to protect include human life (loss of life), system function (loss 

--- Document Chunk 8668 ---
of mission), the environment (loss of environment), etc.   

--- Document Chunk 8669 ---
Movement Authority: Permission for a train to run to a specific location within the constraints of the 

--- Document Chunk 8670 ---
infrastructure [19].  

--- Document Chunk 8671 ---
Movement Permission:  Request from PE to MBS to grant a defined MA for a certain train. 

--- Document Chunk 8672 ---
Safety Design Recommendation: Exported less stringent “recommendation” regarding the findings 

--- Document Chunk 8673 ---
in this document versus more stringent “safety requirements” that may result from a later generation 

--- Document Chunk 8674 ---
of this analysis.  

--- Document Chunk 8675 ---
Safety Requirement: A requirement based on findings from a safety analysis (see safety design 

--- Document Chunk 8676 ---
recommendation). 

--- Document Chunk 8677 ---
Safety Responsibility: Defined responsibility with regards to safety functions of individual actors, 

--- Document Chunk 8678 ---
systems or sub-systems.   

--- Document Chunk 8679 ---
Topography: Refers to geographical map information regarding the features of the terrain that 

--- Document Chunk 8680 ---
correctly represent physical reality (geographical position, elevation,  ...). 

--- Document Chunk 8681 ---
Topology: Subset of topography with linked track sections and identified track elements.  

--- Document Chunk 8682 ---
Unsafe Control Action:  “An Unsafe Control Action (UCA) is a control action that, in a particular 

--- Document Chunk 8683 ---
context and worst-case environment, will lead to a hazard” [1].   

--- Document Chunk 8684 ---
System Level Constraints: “A system-level constraint specifies system conditions or behaviours 

--- Document Chunk 8685 ---
that need to be satisfied to prevent hazards (and ultimately prevent losses)” [1]. 

--- Document Chunk 8686 ---
Validation: “Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that the requirements for a 

--- Document Chunk 8687 ---
specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.”[3] This means validation is intended to 

--- Document Chunk 8688 ---
ensure that the MBS meets the operational needs of the user. 

--- Document Chunk 8689 ---
Verification: “Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that specified requirements 

--- Document Chunk 8690 ---
have been fulfilled.”[3] This means verification is intended to check that the MBS meets its set of 

--- Document Chunk 8691 ---
design specifications.

1 INTRODUCTION 

--- Document Chunk 8922 ---
This present document constitutes the technical contribution from Task 13.3 “Safety Analysis” to the 

--- Document Chunk 8923 ---
Deliverable D13.1 “Moving Block Specifications applying a train-centric approach” in the framework 

--- Document Chunk 8924 ---
of WP13, of FP2 R2DATO. 

--- Document Chunk 8925 ---
“The objective of this task was to work collaboratively to analyze the impact of System Pillar activities 

--- Document Chunk 8926 ---
and Tasks (13.1 Definition/13.2 Specification) to develop a Moving Block Safety Analysis considering 

--- Document Chunk 8927 ---
also the S2R results.” /R2DATO Grant Agreement/ 

--- Document Chunk 8928 ---
To move a step beyond what was previously done in S2R (e.g., in -depth analysis of relevant 

--- Document Chunk 8929 ---
scenarios) a novel method – called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) - shall be applied to 

--- Document Chunk 8930 ---
the matter. This STPA focuses on “unsafe control actions” in contro l and feedback loops within 

--- Document Chunk 8931 ---
complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the potential to identify emergent risks 

--- Document Chunk 8932 ---
stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems, which are often overlooked. 

--- Document Chunk 8933 ---
The subject of this analysis is the “Moving Block System” (MBS) that is being defined and specified 

--- Document Chunk 8934 ---
in WP13. The figure below shows its localization within the planned Moving Block Demonstrator 

--- Document Chunk 8935 ---
(MBD) from WP44/45. In this preliminary architecture it is foreseen that the MBS receives its topology 

--- Document Chunk 8936 ---
model (Domain Data) from an entity designated as Digital Register (DR). Various commands and 

--- Document Chunk 8937 ---
requests (e.g., requests to move a point/request to grant a movement permission) come from the 

--- Document Chunk 8938 ---
Plan Execution (PE) that executes the operational plan from the Traffic Management System (TMS). 

--- Document Chunk 8939 ---
On the other side, MBS facilitates communication with and also commands the Onboard-Units (OBU) 

--- Document Chunk 8940 ---
and Trackside Asset Control & Supervision (TACS) – aka trackside object controllers. 

--- Document Chunk 8941 ---

--- Document Chunk 8953 ---
The approach is “train -centric” in the sense that the physical train itself is considered as the main 

--- Document Chunk 8954 ---
business object instead of indirectly deriving information about the train only by monitoring track 

--- Document Chunk 8955 ---
occupations. Since we apply “moving block principles”, movement authorities can therefore be 

--- Document Chunk 8956 ---
issued up to any point on the track, and trains can safely foll ow each other in absolute braking 

--- Document Chunk 8957 ---
distance without being bound to wait for the next block section to become free. However, the system 

--- Document Chunk 8958 ---
shall still be able to utilize information from previously installed Train Detection Systems (TDS) to 

--- Document Chunk 8959 ---
complement and impro ve localization information where applicable (e.g. if receiving a OBU radio 

--- Document Chunk 8960 ---
transmission takes longer than receiving occupation information from the TDS), and/or for migration 

--- Document Chunk 8961 ---
purposes. Some advantages of the new system are: 

--- Document Chunk 8962 ---
• potential performance gains due to smaller train headway times. 

--- Document Chunk 8963 ---
• reduced efforts for TDS and obsolete lineside signals (cab side signaling). 

--- Document Chunk 8964 ---
• the merger of interlocking and RBC functionality, that enables the MBS system to even 

--- Document Chunk 8965 ---
consider physical trains (since traditional IXL was only concerned about securing routes).   

--- Document Chunk 8966 ---
• the concentration of safety related functions into as few “safety -critical” components as 

--- Document Chunk 8967 ---
possible (thereby reducing the SIL requirement for other components). 

--- Document Chunk 8968 ---
• the (envisaged) capability of runtime configuration updates. 

--- Document Chunk 8969 ---
• (envisaged) improved supplier independence due to open/fully defined interfaces. 

--- Document Chunk 8970 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 8971 ---
MBS is thus by design “the component performing safety related functions” within this novel trackside 

--- Document Chunk 8972 ---
CS. The implications of this approach on overall system safety are of great interest. 

--- Document Chunk 8973 ---
Previous investigations were focused on train localization (performance), radio communication 

--- Document Chunk 8974 ---
(performance and availability), cold movement detection, as well as train length - and train integrity 

--- Document Chunk 8975 ---
data. Ideally, the safety requirements from there can be map ped to the new results. However, a 

--- Document Chunk 8976 ---
focus of this analysis are the control (inter -)actions and feedback between the adjacent systems 

--- Document Chunk 8977 ---
(e.g., what are the main hazards that emerge from command and feedback loop between MBS and 

--- Document Chunk 8978 ---
a safety operator panel).

2 SCOPE 

--- Document Chunk 8990 ---
The analysis for the Task 13.3 details the results of the safety analysis with focus on the MBS and 

--- Document Chunk 8991 ---
its interfaces to the other internal and external systems, as depicted in Figure 2 - MBS System 

--- Document Chunk 8992 ---
Boundary. It is based on the STPA analysis method for the current safety analysis and considers the 

--- Document Chunk 8993 ---
result from the former X2Rail project. The STPA analysis proved to be the most suitable method at 

--- Document Chunk 8994 ---
a time, when the system requirements and the system design were st ill subject to significant 

--- Document Chunk 8995 ---
changes. Like in traditional safety methods, the efforts involved are highly dependent on the level of 

--- Document Chunk 8996 ---
depth to which the STPA shall be conducted, and since the task resources are limited (due to overall 

--- Document Chunk 8997 ---
WP allocation as well as due to the number of active authors) an adaptive approach is applied. While 

--- Document Chunk 8998 ---
the whole system -stack involved in “command control & signaling” shall be covered at a high 

--- Document Chunk 8999 ---
abstraction level, certain points of interest (e.g., where valuable information for feed back to the 

--- Document Chunk 9000 ---
specification task can be generated) can be investigated on a lower abstraction level, down to 

--- Document Chunk 9001 ---
individual control/feedback telegrams. 

--- Document Chunk 9002 ---
The analysis does not provide all the evidence to obtain certification or to fulfil the mandatory 

--- Document Chunk 9003 ---
requirements or design standards (e.g.: EN50126 -1 and -2, EN50128, EN50129, EN50159, ...). 

--- Document Chunk 9004 ---
However, it will define safety related design recommendations which shall be considered during the 

--- Document Chunk 9005 ---
development of the MBS and may be mapped to safety requirements in a later stage.  

--- Document Chunk 9006 ---
The overall analysis of the whole Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) as depicted in Figure 1 below 

--- Document Chunk 9007 ---
is covered in WP44/45 (Task 45.5.). 

--- Document Chunk 9008 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9009 ---
2.1 SYSTEM BOUNDARY 

--- Document Chunk 9010 ---
As briefly described in the introduction, the system boundary of MBS is defined through interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 9011 ---
within the Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) (e.g., I_PE, I_DR) and also to the outside of the MBD 

--- Document Chunk 9012 ---
(e.g., I_TACS, I_TACS). Even though similar definitions have already been produced within Task 

--- Document Chunk 9013 ---
13.1, 13.2 and 44.3 we decided to reproduce (copy/update/rewrite) such a section here – at least 

--- Document Chunk 9014 ---
until the documents from these tasks are in a stable version. Within this section there is also a 

--- Document Chunk 9015 ---
description of all the subsystems depicted in the drawing below. Relevant Interface descriptions can 

--- Document Chunk 9016 ---
be found in chapter  6 Interface Criticality  together with a preliminary analysis of the interface 

--- Document Chunk 9017 ---
criticality. The handover to neighboring systems is out of scope for this analysis.

traditional route logic. The interface to a radio-based ETCS related neighbouring 

--- Document Chunk 9042 ---

--- Document Chunk 9173 ---
The documents, project outputs, open standards as well as documents from tasks within R2DATO 

--- Document Chunk 9174 ---
that are relevant to the work here are listed and briefly described in this chapter. 

--- Document Chunk 9175 ---
3.1 SYSTEM PILLAR INPUTS 

--- Document Chunk 9176 ---
System Pillar provided an envelope for the ERJU activities within the “common business objectives”- 

--- Document Chunk 9177 ---
and the “operational visions” documents. Relevant passages have been cited below and shall be 

--- Document Chunk 9178 ---
e.g., used as a benchmark for concluding remarks (in a later stage of the document). 

--- Document Chunk 9179 ---
3.1.1 CBO ([6], p.18) - Optimize safety strategies and standards 

--- Document Chunk 9180 ---
• Safety critical elements of a system should be optimized and simplified through design by 

--- Document Chunk 9181 ---
moving away from bespoke solutions. The development of these parameters facilitates a 

--- Document Chunk 9182 ---
common approach to safety and security. (simplified standard safety components) 

--- Document Chunk 9183 ---
• Simulation and modelling tools are needed to accurately calculate and validate the 

--- Document Chunk 9184 ---
performance of systems with an incorporated robust PRAMSS framework controlling for the 

--- Document Chunk 9185 ---
development process and the RAMSS change impact analysis for changes inside of the li fe 

--- Document Chunk 9186 ---
cycle. (validated system performance) (robust PRAMSS framework) 

--- Document Chunk 9187 ---
• The safety logic shall have a generic approval and authorization in which it is proven that it just 

--- Document Chunk 9188 ---
needs a reliable input of topology information and train information and will assure safety on 

--- Document Chunk 9189 ---
this basis. {safety logic with generic safety approval} 

--- Document Chunk 9190 ---
• The exchange of components or connection of new subsystems under production shall happen 

--- Document Chunk 9191 ---
without a new safety case or preparation processes. {seamless and selective exchange of 

--- Document Chunk 9192 ---
components under production} 

--- Document Chunk 9193 ---
• An authorized vehicle can be operated everywhere on compliant infrastructure without local 

--- Document Chunk 9194 ---
integration test. {vehicle is interoperable without local integration test} 

--- Document Chunk 9195 ---
3.1.2 Operational Vision ([7], p.20) - Enhanced safety assurance process 

--- Document Chunk 9196 ---
• Because of a high architecture quality, safe integration of components to a whole safe 

--- Document Chunk 9197 ---
application is just done by a centralized (online) compliance test (certificate), that is done once 

--- Document Chunk 9198 ---
(strategy “modular safety”). 

--- Document Chunk 9199 ---
• The quality of validation/testing and practical risk assessment for components and “system of 

--- Document Chunk 9200 ---
systems” reaches a quality level, that allows to simplify bureaucratic development processes 

--- Document Chunk 9201 ---
of today. 

--- Document Chunk 9202 ---
• Independent/redundant/stable safety monitoring systems and actor advisory systems allow a 

--- Document Chunk 9203 ---
more dynamic change of systems and diversity of configurations and support a continuous 

--- Document Chunk 9204 ---
improvement process. 

--- Document Chunk 9205 ---

4 SAFETY ANALYSIS METHODEOLOGY 

--- Document Chunk 9245 ---
This chapter describes the used safety analysis methodologies on a very high abstraction level. Even 

--- Document Chunk 9246 ---
though some aspects of the larger demonstrator (MBD) architecture have to be taken into account, 

--- Document Chunk 9247 ---
the target of this safety analysis is the Moving Block System (MBS). The analysis is partly based on 

--- Document Chunk 9248 ---
outputs from predecessor projects, such as X2Rail and RCA, but it also relies on inputs from system 

--- Document Chunk 9249 ---
pillar, as well as the results from connected tasks within R2DATO. 

--- Document Chunk 9250 ---
The envisaged goal for the demonstrator (MBD) is TRL (Technology Readiness Level) 6 [20]. At this 

--- Document Chunk 9251 ---
stage, the complete safety analysis is qualitative only, not quantitative. Quantitative methods, such 

--- Document Chunk 9252 ---
as fault trees to verify specific safety objectives, may  be added in a later stage when a higher TRL 

--- Document Chunk 9253 ---
shall be achieved. 

--- Document Chunk 9254 ---
Figure 3 shows the scope of the safety analysis in the so called “hourglass model” from CENELEC 

--- Document Chunk 9255 ---
EN 50126-2. 

--- Document Chunk 9256 ---

4.1 COMMON SAFETY METHODS 

--- Document Chunk 9269 ---
For safety -relevant changes to railroad systems (e.g., technical, operational, regulative or 

--- Document Chunk 9270 ---
organizational changes), the risk assessment process in accordance with EU regulations 2015/1136 

--- Document Chunk 9271 ---
and 402/2013 (CSM-RA) must be applied. 

--- Document Chunk 9272 ---
However, technical changes to a system that are handled with the RAMS management process of 

--- Document Chunk 9273 ---
the CENELEC standard EN 50126 (+128/129) are generally compliant with the CSM procedure. 

--- Document Chunk 9274 ---
4.2 CENELEC STANDARDS 

--- Document Chunk 9275 ---
Tasks 13.1 and 13.2 within work package 13 are developed along the relevant CENELEC standards. 

--- Document Chunk 9276 ---
Thus, the following standards apply: 

--- Document Chunk 9277 ---
• EN 50126-1:2017: Generic RAMS Process 

--- Document Chunk 9278 ---
• EN 50126-2:2017: Systems Approach to Safety 

--- Document Chunk 9279 ---
• EN 50716:2023: Requirements for software development (supersedes EN 50128:2011: 

--- Document Chunk 9280 ---
Software) 

--- Document Chunk 9281 ---
• EN 50129:2018: Electronic systems 

--- Document Chunk 9282 ---
They shall be applied as far as practicable for a TRL 6 system. This means that the standards will 

--- Document Chunk 9283 ---
be taken as a major input for the development, but some requirements may be interpreted in a more 

--- Document Chunk 9284 ---
relaxed way as it would be the case for a fully operational system. 

--- Document Chunk 9285 ---
4.3 STPA 

--- Document Chunk 9286 ---
The STPA handbook [1] describes the practical application of STPA in great detail. Here, we only 

--- Document Chunk 9287 ---
provide a very short description and the reason why STPA was chosen. 

--- Document Chunk 9288 ---
STPA (System -Theoretic Process Analysis) is a method to identify hazards and related system 

--- Document Chunk 9289 ---
constraints in complex systems, in order to identify (unsafe) control actions that lead to those hazards 

--- Document Chunk 9290 ---
(and related losses). Mitigations to avoid these unsafe control actions can then be derived. 

--- Document Chunk 9291 ---
The reason why STPA was chosen is that it is geared towards large and complex systems with 

--- Document Chunk 9292 ---
multiple interactions, where hazards do not necessarily only arise due to component failures, but 

--- Document Chunk 9293 ---
also due to emergent behavior involving multiple components. The MBS (especially in combination 

--- Document Chunk 9294 ---
with its interfaces and interactions with the environment) is a novel system, for which this method is 

--- Document Chunk 9295 ---
believed to be of great value. 

--- Document Chunk 9296 ---
5 RISK ANALYSIS 

--- Document Chunk 9297 ---
This chapter details and documents the results of the conducted STPA analysis as described in 

--- Document Chunk 9298 ---
chapter 4.3. The analysis focuses on the marked section of the “hourglass model” from CENELEC 

--- Document Chunk 9299 ---
EN 50126-2 as shown in Figure 3 which is intended to derive the safety requirements from operator 

--- Document Chunk 9300 ---
point of view. These requirements must be considered by the suppliers of an MBS system. The 

--- Document Chunk 9301 ---
supplier’s safety analysis shall consider these requirements as their safety goals, that can be broken 

--- Document Chunk 9302 ---
down into further sub safety goals and requirements.

5.1 LOSSES 

--- Document Chunk 9316 ---
The first step of the STPA is to define which losses to consider for the analysis. The purpose of the 

--- Document Chunk 9317 ---
analysis is to find possible causes for accidents. An accident is defined as an undesired or unplanned 

--- Document Chunk 9318 ---
event that results in a loss. A loss always involve s something of value to the stakeholder. Typical 

--- Document Chunk 9319 ---
examples are loss of human life or injury, but also property damage, environmental pollution or loss 

--- Document Chunk 9320 ---
of mission. [1] For this analysis, three main losses are considered:

  • People on the platform or neighbourhood of tracks 

--- Document Chunk 9344 ---
  • Railway workers 

--- Document Chunk 9345 ---
  • Trespassers (persons present on railway premises where such presence is 

--- Document Chunk 9346 ---
      forbidden) 

--- Document Chunk 9347 ---
L-3 Environmental loss (i.e. transport of dangerous goods)  

--- Document Chunk 9348 ---
Table 11 – Losses 

--- Document Chunk 9349 ---
Explicitly excluded from this analysis are loss of mission and loss of customer satisfaction, as our 

--- Document Chunk 9350 ---
focus for this analysis is strictly on safety (e.g., a person’s life). 

--- Document Chunk 9351 ---
5.2 HAZARDS 

--- Document Chunk 9352 ---
The next step of the analysis is to find the system level hazards. Within STPA, a hazard is defined 

--- Document Chunk 9353 ---
as “a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environmental 

--- Document Chunk 9354 ---
conditions, will lead to a loss” [1]. Note that thi s definition differs from the classical definition of a 

--- Document Chunk 9355 ---
hazard. It is essential that hazards are defined at system level instead of component level, as 

--- Document Chunk 9356 ---
hazards may also arise from the interaction between components and cannot necessarily be 

--- Document Chunk 9357 ---
assigned to a single component.  

--- Document Chunk 9358 ---
A system is defined as “a set of components that act together as a whole to achieve some common 

--- Document Chunk 9359 ---
goal, objective, or end” [1]. It may contain subsystems and the analysis may be based higher or 

--- Document Chunk 9360 ---
lower level of abstraction of individual subsystems as needed. 

--- Document Chunk 9361 ---
In order to identify system level hazards, it is therefore necessary to identify the system under 

--- Document Chunk 9362 ---
consideration and the analysis boundary as defined in chapter 2.1 System Boundary. A useful way 

--- Document Chunk 9363 ---
to define the analysis boundary may be to include only systems within the analysis boundary over 

--- Document Chunk 9364 ---
which the system designers have some form of control.  

--- Document Chunk 9365 ---
To ease readability the hazards are described in a generic form. Each hazard may have multiple 

--- Document Chunk 9366 ---
sub-hazards, further detailing the high-level hazard.  

--- Document Chunk 9367 ---
The hazards differentiate between losses in connection with other trains and hazards in connection 

--- Document Chunk 9368 ---
with “other obstacles”. For the purposes of this analysis, runaway trains are regarded as “other 

--- Document Chunk 9369 ---
obstacles".

5.4 HIERARCHICAL CONTROL STRUCTURE (HCS) 

--- Document Chunk 9686 ---
The hierarchical control structure models the system using functional components called controllers. 

--- Document Chunk 9687 ---
Higher level controllers may enforce constraints on the controlled system by using control actions. 

--- Document Chunk 9688 ---
Additionally, controllers may receive information from other controllers as feedback. Together the 

--- Document Chunk 9689 ---
controllers form feedback control loops, shaping the overall behavior of the system.  

--- Document Chunk 9690 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9691 ---
Which actions a controller performs is determined by its control algorithm, representing the decision-

--- Document Chunk 9692 ---
making process. The information available to the controller at decision time is represented by the 

--- Document Chunk 9693 ---
process model. A simple case of a control feedback loop is illustrated in Figure 5. 

--- Document Chunk 9694 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9695 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9696 ---
Figure 5 - Simple control-loop 

--- Document Chunk 9697 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9698 ---
The controller in the hierarchical control structure (HCS) is a functional representation, which may 

--- Document Chunk 9699 ---
represent a single system or multiple system. A controller may be a human as well as a technical 

--- Document Chunk 9700 ---
system. The control structure may be represented using mul tiple levels, where system details for 

--- Document Chunk 9701 ---
lower levels are added as needed for the analysis.

--- Document Chunk 9737 ---
and internal operations are needed. Assumptions from the WP13 System Definition (as recorded in 

--- Document Chunk 9738 ---

5.6 SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES 

--- Document Chunk 9879 ---

--- Document Chunk 9886 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9887 ---
5.6.1 Moving Block System (MBS) 

--- Document Chunk 9888 ---
The responsibilities of MBS essentially comprise the following areas: 

--- Document Chunk 9889 ---
• Assess risk of commands for trains and infrastructure elements. Reject commands, which will 

--- Document Chunk 9890 ---
result in an unsafe situation. Forward or process safety-validated commands.  

--- Document Chunk 9891 ---
• Intervention if risk of railway accidents is not tolerable (e.g., point in reservation area loses its 

--- Document Chunk 9892 ---
end position, train moving too fast, runaway trains, …). 

--- Document Chunk 9893 ---
• Safe communication with trains and field elements 

--- Document Chunk 9894 ---
• Provide an up-to-date, reliable and consistent system view of trains, infrastructure and other 

--- Document Chunk 9895 ---
relevant parties (e.g., level crossings) 

--- Document Chunk 9896 ---

5.6.3 Operator 

--- Document Chunk 10154 ---
Concerning the operator, we reiterate two important assumptions here: 

--- Document Chunk 10155 ---
• interaction between the operator and MBS only involves safety related information [ASM-22] 

--- Document Chunk 10156 ---
• other interactions of the operator with the system are done via the PE or the TMS [ASM-23] 

--- Document Chunk 10157 ---
The reason for these assumptions is that the PE and TMS implement the operational processes and 

--- Document Chunk 10158 ---
MBS acts as a gatekeeper that monitors if the risk is tolerable and forwards safe 

--- Document Chunk 10159 ---
commands/authorities.

--- Document Chunk 10635 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 10636 ---
Scenarios for unsafe control actions: 

--- Document Chunk 10637 ---
[S1-UCA-OP-1]: Two railway points P1 and P2 report a lost end position and are unable to execute 

--- Document Chunk 10638 ---
throwover commands by the operator. As the railway points are within close proximity, a single 

--- Document Chunk 10639 ---
maintenance team is dispatched to investigate the two points. Th e maintenance team is able to fix 

--- Document Chunk 10640 ---
the position of P1 and reports work completed this to the Operator. The operator mistakenly believes 

--- Document Chunk 10641 ---
the team also fixed the position of point P2, which the team was also tasked to investigate. As a 

--- Document Chunk 10642 ---
result, the operator provides an infrastructure state not matching reality to MBS [UCA-OP-1] 

--- Document Chunk 10643 ---
=> [SDR-1]: Provide an operational rule set which explicitly determines to which infrastructure item 

--- Document Chunk 10644 ---
a completed (safety related) intervention refers/referred to. 

--- Document Chunk 10645 ---
[S2-UCA-OP-2]: When passing a protected level crossing, the train driver notices that the bars on 

--- Document Chunk 10646 ---
one side are not fully closed and reports this to the operator. As this particular level crossing had 

--- Document Chunk 10647 ---
problems in the past, the operator mistakenly believes that this was already entered into the operator 

--- Document Chunk 10648 ---
panel. As a result, a required URA is not applied to the MA [UCA-OP-2]. 

--- Document Chunk 10649 ---
=> [SDR-2]: When changes to the operational state are reported by personnel, the operator shall 

--- Document Chunk 10650 ---
always check if they are already entered in the operation state of MBS, even if the operator believes 

--- Document Chunk 10651 ---
this has already been done in the past  

--- Document Chunk 10652 ---
=> [SDR-3]: The operator panel shall provide easily accessible information on all currently manually 

--- Document Chunk 10653 ---
entered infrastructure state with the required confidence for a safety related function. 

--- Document Chunk 10654 ---
[S3-UCA-OP-3]: A construction team is in the field upgrading multiple railway points. The 

--- Document Chunk 10655 ---
construction is scheduled sequentially so that the impact on the railway traffic is minimized. Due to 

--- Document Chunk 10656 ---
unforeseen problems on site, the construction order of the points is switched and this is reported to 

--- Document Chunk 10657 ---
the operator. As the operators shift ends shortly and the change only affects the next shift, he leaves 

--- Document Chunk 10658 ---
a note for the next shift. When the next shift starts, an operational disturbance keeps the operator 

--- Document Chunk 10659 ---

--- Document Chunk 10666 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 10667 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 10668 ---
busy. As a result, the note concerning the construction schedule is read only after construction has 

--- Document Chunk 10669 ---
already begun and the operator reports the known operational state to MBS too late [UCA-OP-3] 

--- Document Chunk 10670 ---
=> [SDR -4]: The interface for the operator shall allow to pre -schedule usage restriction areas.  

--- Document Chunk 10671 ---
=> [SDR-5]: The operator shift handover shall include either an operational process or digital means 

--- Document Chunk 10672 ---
that prevent a loss of (safety related) information during the handover. 

--- Document Chunk 10673 ---
[S4-UCA-OP-4]: Due to construction work, a temporary usage restriction area with a speed reduction 

--- Document Chunk 10674 ---
shall be established. When entering the speed restriction, the operator makes a typo leading to a 

--- Document Chunk 10675 ---
usage restriction area with an excessive speed limit [UCA-OP-4]. 

--- Document Chunk 10676 ---
=> [SDR-6]: The operator panel should implement procedures to verify the entered usage restriction 

--- Document Chunk 10677 ---
data, before the entered data is passed to the MBS system. 

--- Document Chunk 10678 ---
[S5-UCA-OP-5]: A maintenance team performs work on two tracks T1 and T2 closely located to each 

--- Document Chunk 10679 ---
other. When the team reports that it has completed its work for T1, the operator mistakenly believes 

--- Document Chunk 10680 ---
that the work on both tracks has been completed. As a resul t, the operator revokes the usage 

--- Document Chunk 10681 ---
restriction area for T1 and T2 when it still should be applied for T2 [UCA-OP-5]. 

--- Document Chunk 10682 ---
=> See [SDR-1] and [SDR-3] 

--- Document Chunk 10683 ---
[S6-UCA-OP-6]: The operator receives a report from a train driver that there are leaves on the track 

--- Document Chunk 10684 ---
reducing braking performance. The operator knows a corresponding usage restriction has already 

--- Document Chunk 10685 ---
been entered by the previous shift. However, this usage restriction has since expired. The operator 

--- Document Chunk 10686 ---
mistakenly believes the usage restriction is still applied and as a result does not provide the usage 

--- Document Chunk 10687 ---
restriction to the operational state of MBS as needed [UCA-OP-6]. 

--- Document Chunk 10688 ---
=> See [SDR-2] and [SDR-3] 

--- Document Chunk 10689 ---
[S7-UCA-OP-7]: An operational disturbance requires the operator to manually manage a large 

--- Document Chunk 10690 ---
number of trains. As the timetable should be upheld as much as possible, the operator is under time 

--- Document Chunk 10691 ---
pressure. In this situation a construction team reports that it will begin constructions on track T1 in 

--- Document Chunk 10692 ---
half an hour. The operator takes note and is immedia tely occupied with train management again. 

--- Document Chunk 10693 ---
Due to time pressure, the operator only follows up on the note after the construction has already 

--- Document Chunk 10694 ---
begun. As a result, the operator provides the usage restriction area for the construction site too late 

--- Document Chunk 10695 ---
to MBS [UCA-OP-7]. 

--- Document Chunk 10696 ---
=> [SDR-7]: Entering usage restriction areas shall take priority over the regular management of 

--- Document Chunk 10697 ---
running trains 

--- Document Chunk 10698 ---
=> see also [SDR-4] 

--- Document Chunk 10699 ---
[S8-UCA-OP-26]: The operator receives a report from the construction team that construction will be 

--- Document Chunk 10700 ---
completed in half an hour. However, unforeseen difficulties on the construction site cause the 

--- Document Chunk 10701 ---
operation to take longer. Emerged in their work the construction team does not report this delay to 

--- Document Chunk 10702 ---
the operator. The operator mistakenly believes that the team has finished their work as planned and 

--- Document Chunk 10703 ---
revokes the usage restriction area too early [UCA-OP-26]. 

--- Document Chunk 10704 ---
=> [SDR-8]: The operator shall always verify with the construction team on site that the work has 

--- Document Chunk 10705 ---
actually been completed before removing the corresponding usage restriction area. 

--- Document Chunk 10706 ---
[S9-UCA-OP-14/17/18]: Similar reasoning to [S7 -UCA-OP-9] (handling of commands under time 

--- Document Chunk 10707 ---
pressure, selecting the wrong train) [UCA-OP-14, UCA-OP-17, UCA-OP-18]

--- Document Chunk 10717 ---
[S10-UCA-OP-15]: The Operator wants to stop a train before a danger point. The interface requires 

--- Document Chunk 10718 ---
that the operator enters the stopping position manually. While entering the stopping position, the 

--- Document Chunk 10719 ---
operator makes a typo. As a result, the operator provides a  conditional emergency stop command 

--- Document Chunk 10720 ---
with the wrong position. As the train has already passed this position, the command is ignored by 

--- Document Chunk 10721 ---
the OBU [UCA-OP-15]. 

--- Document Chunk 10722 ---
=> [SDR-9]: The operator panel shall be designed to support the operator with contextual information 

--- Document Chunk 10723 ---
when executing operator commands. I.e. the operator shall be able to select the stopping position 

--- Document Chunk 10724 ---
based on an interface with information about the physical elements/tr ackside assets and select a 

--- Document Chunk 10725 ---
stopping position based on the physical elements position. 

--- Document Chunk 10726 ---
[S11-UCA-OP-16]: The operator receives information that part of a track has become unexpectedly 

--- Document Chunk 10727 ---
occupied. A train currently has a valid MA over the obstructed portion of the track. The operator 

--- Document Chunk 10728 ---
believes the train is still at a large distance from the obstr ucted portion and issues a conditional 

--- Document Chunk 10729 ---
emergency stop. However, the train position report was outdated and the train is already past the 

--- Document Chunk 10730 ---
stopping position for the conditional emergency stop. As a result, the operator fails to provide the 

--- Document Chunk 10731 ---
required unconditional emergency stop command. [UCA-OP-16] 

--- Document Chunk 10732 ---
=> [SDR-10]: The operator shall receive a (visual) indication about the reported train position age. 

--- Document Chunk 10733 ---
(e.g., information outdated longer than for a defined threshold should be indicated). 

--- Document Chunk 10734 ---

[S1-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is a train composed of two consists, T1a and T1b, with one OBU per 

--- Document Chunk 11046 ---
consist. The train is initially at standstill, and both consists are unpowered and coupled and no TTDs 

--- Document Chunk 11047 ---
are located at the track. The consists T1a and T1b are uncoupled while the train is powered off. The 

--- Document Chunk 11048 ---
driver enters the cab of T1a, opens the desk and enters the validated train data. He mistakenly 

--- Document Chunk 11049 ---
believes that T1b is still coupled and inputs the total of T1a and T1b as train length into the DMI. As 

--- Document Chunk 11050 ---
the consist T1a is still integer, the TIMS reports integrity confirmed. When PE requests an MA for 

--- Document Chunk 11051 ---
T1a from MBS, MBS mistakenly believes that a train with a length of T1 is moved, while in reality 

--- Document Chunk 11052 ---
train T1b is still standing on the tracks.  As a result, after releasing the MA behind T1a, MBS grants 

--- Document Chunk 11053 ---
another train T2 a MA into the region where T1b is still standing, leading to a collision [UCA -MBS-

not equipped with a functioning TIMS and no TTDs are available for TR1. The driver opens the desk 

--- Document Chunk 11059 ---
and enters the validated train data. Due to operational changes, additional cars have been added to 

--- Document Chunk 11060 ---
the train. The driver enters a too short train length LEN2, because he is not aware that the train is 

--- Document Chunk 11061 ---
longer than during normal operations. As he is already behind schedule and there are visual 

--- Document Chunk 11062 ---
obstructions blocking his view to the end of the train, the driver confirms the train integrity without 

--- Document Chunk 11063 ---
seeing the last train cars. Therefore, MBS mistakenly believes T1 has length LEN2, which is shorter 

--- Document Chunk 11064 ---
than the real train length LEN1, and grants an MA to T1 based on LEN2. As a result, after releasing 

--- Document Chunk 11065 ---
the MA behind T1, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into the region where T1 is still standing,

[S3-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is initially at parked and located at L1, near the bottom of a valley. The 

--- Document Chunk 11081 ---
train is powered down and no TTDs are available for this section of the track. After applying the 

--- Document Chunk 11082 ---
parking brakes, the railway personal does not add the brak e shoes below the wheels. Therefore, 

--- Document Chunk 11083 ---
after the air pressure is no longer sufficient to keep the train at standstill, T1 starts to move towards 

--- Document Chunk 11084 ---
the bottom of the valley and is now located at L2. MBS mistakenly believes that T1 is still located at 

--- Document Chunk 11085 ---
its last known location L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L2, leading to a collision

[S4-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is initially at standstill and located at L1. T1 is in no power mode and no 

--- Document Chunk 11091 ---
TTDs are available. The driver opens the desk and enters the validated train data. The OBU does 

--- Document Chunk 11092 ---
not know the current train position. The driver therefore t ells the operator the train position, and 

--- Document Chunk 11093 ---
requests a staff responsible movement authorization. However, as the driver cannot see the track 

--- Document Chunk 11094 ---
kilometer board due to visual obstructions, he mistakenly reports the wrong train position L2 to the 

--- Document Chunk 11095 ---
operator. The operator permits a train movement based on a L2, while the train is in reality located 

--- Document Chunk 11096 ---
at L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L1, leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]

TR1 is equipped with a track circuit TTD1, which is unable to detect the maintenance vehicle M1. At 

--- Document Chunk 11102 ---
MBS initialization, TTD1 is reported as clear. Therefore, MBS i s unaware of the presence of M1 at 

--- Document Chunk 11103 ---
L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T1 a MA into L1, leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16] 

--- Document Chunk 11104 ---
=> [SDR-15]: When the presence of maintenance vehicles is expected, track circuits alone should

[S1-UCA-MBS-17] Train T1 is at standstill and located at the left track of railway point P1. The

reported train length of LEN1 or T1 is shorter than the physical train length LEN2. Therefore, MBS 

--- Document Chunk 11110 ---
mistakenly assumes that T1 is outside the fouling point of P1. As a result, MBS grants another train

[S3-UCA-MBS-17] Maintenance vehicle M1 located within worksite W1 on track TR1 and equipped

with a movable crane arm. Track TR2 runs parallel to TR1. If fully extended, the crane arm of M1 

--- Document Chunk 11132 ---
can reach into the maximum permitted clearance gauge TR2. Because w orksite W1 is located on

TR1, MBS mistakenly believes this worksite cannot affect trains running on TR2. As a result, an MA

for another train T2 running on TR2 is granted while the crane arm of M1 is extended into TR2,

[S4-UCA-MBS-17] Train T1 performs end of mission on side Track TR1 which is connected to the

main track TR2 via point P1. Due to an operational error the train was not protected against roll -

--- Document Chunk 11141 ---
away. After some time, the pressure in the brake tanks drops and the train starts to roll toward P1. 

--- Document Chunk 11142 ---
In the mean-time another MA was granted for Train T2 on the main track TR2 leading over P1. Since 

--- Document Chunk 11143 ---
MBS cannot detect the unexpected occupation on P1 nor the unexpected vacancy of the TTD on T1 

--- Document Chunk 11144 ---
in time, train T1 collides with train T2 leading to a flank collision.

The loss scenarios for trackside assets occur together with unsafe control actions on the I_OBU

interface (e.g. granting an MA) and the I_OP interface (e.g., manually reseat a TDS). Often, the state

[S1-UCA-DR-1/2] DR provides a new set of domain data to MBS which has not been verified to 

--- Document Chunk 11658 ---
comply with the given engineering rules, or which is malformed in other ways. Since no further 

--- Document Chunk 11659 ---
checks are applied on MBS side a data type for the configuration of railway point P1 is misinterpreted 

--- Document Chunk 11660 ---
such that point position “left” actually corresponds to point position “right”. MBS then allows the

movement of train T1 over point P1 leading to collision or derailment on a side track.

[S1-UCA-DR-3] DR provides a new set of domain data to MBS, however the distance between 

--- Document Chunk 11675 ---
railway point P1 and railway point P2 in the data is longer than in reality. MBS is thus not aware that 

--- Document Chunk 11676 ---

[S2-UCA-DR-3] DR provides a new set of domain data to MBS that was originally validated by a

processing step such that the distance between railway point P1 and railway point P2 is now longer

--- Document Chunk 11686 ---
to be switched under T1 leading to a derailment.

[S1-UCA-DR-4/5] Construction work to shorten a side track was scheduled for a certain date. Due 

--- Document Chunk 11692 ---
to operational changes the actual construction work starts early, and a URA for work site protection 

--- Document Chunk 11693 ---
is created together with the dispatcher. After the construction work is finished, the dispatcher lifts the 

--- Document Chunk 11694 ---
worksite URA, although the topography and configuration data in MBS was not yet updated to reflect 

--- Document Chunk 11695 ---
a shorter track. As a result, a train is authorized to enter the side track and collides with the buffer 

--- Document Chunk 11696 ---
stop. 

--- Document Chunk 11697 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11698 ---
-> [SDR-21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have 

--- Document Chunk 11699 ---
to be preceded by a (sufficiently large & restrictive) URA, and that this URA may only be lifted if the 

--- Document Chunk 11700 ---
changes have been updated in the topography & configuration data of MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 11701 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11702 ---
[S1-UCA-DR-11] For some reason it was decided that domain data should be updated before the 

--- Document Chunk 11703 ---
actual construction work on the tracks took place. To secure the area where track changes will occur 

--- Document Chunk 11704 ---
a URA was foreseen. However, MBS was not commanded to activate this URA before the following 

--- Document Chunk 11705 ---
topology/domain data update. Since MBS has no means of deciding if such a URA would have been 

--- Document Chunk 11706 ---
required it activates the new domain data version right away. Subsequently. MBS allows a train to 

--- Document Chunk 11707 ---
move into the site with a higher velocity than allowed for safe operation. . 

--- Document Chunk 11708 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11709 ---
=> [SDR-24] If an URA for safe activation of new set of domain data is required the domain data

This chapter details the results of the safety analysis of the MBS safety boundary analysis and the 

--- Document Chunk 11813 ---
related interfaces. The aim of this analysis is to identify safety related connections and systems 

--- Document Chunk 11814 ---
relating to the MBS. The MBD shall support different modes of operation. This chapter analysis these 

--- Document Chunk 11815 ---
modes for the impact to the MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 11816 ---
6.1 SYSTEM SAFETY BOUNDARY 

--- Document Chunk 11817 ---
The system boundary is given through the “system definition” from task 13.1 and was further 

--- Document Chunk 11818 ---
analyzed from the safety perspective. The following figure classifies the sub systems of the MBD 

--- Document Chunk 11819 ---
into safety related and non safety related controllers.

--- Document Chunk 12187 ---
are adequately considered in this analysis. This is done by analyzing each hazard from the X2Rail 

--- Document Chunk 12188 ---
results and by providing a trace to different artefacts of this STPA analysis.

At time T1, BG_B is encountered, the ETCS On-board then relocates the Min

--- Document Chunk 12397 ---
If linking information is not available or not used, the ETCS On-board then sends

8 COMPILED DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS 

--- Document Chunk 12818 ---
This chapter contains the compiled safety design recommendations for the analyzed control loops 

--- Document Chunk 12819 ---
supplemented with rationale, guidance &/or example statements. Although these enriched 

--- Document Chunk 12820 ---
recommendations should be self -explanatory, it might make sense to look u p the linked 

--- Document Chunk 12821 ---
(hypothetical) scenarios for each, that led to unsafe control actions in the chapters above. 

--- Document Chunk 12822 ---
8.1 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS ON BOARD UNIT 

--- Document Chunk 12823 ---
=>[SDR-13]: In regions where the parking of vehicles is expected, methods for detecting the 

--- Document Chunk 12824 ---
presence of trains independent of train position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these 

--- Document Chunk 12825 ---
regions) 

--- Document Chunk 12826 ---
Rationale Uncontrolled train movements, like runaway cars after parking, are not constrained by a 

--- Document Chunk 12827 ---
movement authority. Such a scenario is described in [S3-UCA-MBS-16] 

--- Document Chunk 12828 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12829 ---
=> [SDR-16]: Between controlled region and unsupervised region, the movement of non -

--- Document Chunk 12830 ---
communicating trains shall be detectable, i.e. using TTDs, or preventable using a point/derailer 

--- Document Chunk 12831 ---
(similar to [SDR-13]) 

--- Document Chunk 12832 ---
Rationale Detecting or preventing the presence of uncontrolled trains out of unsupervised regions 

--- Document Chunk 12833 ---
(e.g. at the borders of the region of control) is needed for assumption 2. A corresponding scenario 

--- Document Chunk 12834 ---
is described in [S2-UCA-MBS-17]. 

--- Document Chunk 12835 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12836 ---
=> [SDR-18] Simple detection of track occupation is not sufficient to prevent flank collisions in all 

--- Document Chunk 12837 ---
cases. Technical means to secure a sufficiently large vacant area before the fouling point is required. 

--- Document Chunk 12838 ---
Rationale Even when the train presence is detected according to assumption 1., the reaction times 

--- Document Chunk 12839 ---
can be insufficient to prevent a flank collision hazard, making further measures necessary: 

--- Document Chunk 12840 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12841 ---
=> [ASM-4-v2] MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train movement but supports them for 

--- Document Chunk 12842 ---
migration purposes or systems where the chance of uncontrolled movement cannot be sufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 12843 ---
controlled by other means. 

--- Document Chunk 12844 ---
Rationale The assumption that TTDs can completely be eliminated while still guarding against all 

--- Document Chunk 12845 ---
loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. As long as uncontrolled train movement cannot 

--- Document Chunk 12846 ---
be eliminated, their presence is still required.

=> [SDR-11]: MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected (i.e. due to 

--- Document Chunk 12858 ---
splitting and joining). 

--- Document Chunk 12859 ---
Rationale If the MBS detects an unexpected difference between the reported and expected train 

--- Document Chunk 12860 ---
length, this could indicate a wrong data input (either by the driver or in the operation plan).  

--- Document Chunk 12861 ---
Example This can be done e.g. by informing the MBS that splitting or joining is performed via the 

--- Document Chunk 12862 ---
plan execution. 

--- Document Chunk 12863 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12864 ---
8.2 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS OPERATOR PANEL 

--- Document Chunk 12865 ---
=> [SDR-1]: Provide an operational rule set which explicitly determines to which infrastructure item 

--- Document Chunk 12866 ---
a completed (safety related) intervention refers/referred to. 

--- Document Chunk 12867 ---
Rationale Since safety functions of MBS directly depend on the correctness of its operational state, 

--- Document Chunk 12868 ---
special care has to be taken where a human operator is allowed to issue safety related commands 

--- Document Chunk 12869 ---
or settings. 

--- Document Chunk 12870 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12871 ---
=> [SDR-2]: When changes to the operational state are reported by personnel, the operator shall 

--- Document Chunk 12872 ---
always check if they are already entered in the operation state of MBS, even if the operator believes 

--- Document Chunk 12873 ---
this has already been done in the past 

--- Document Chunk 12874 ---
Rationale as above. 

--- Document Chunk 12875 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12876 ---
=> [SDR-3]: The operator panel shall provide easily accessible information on all currently manually 

--- Document Chunk 12877 ---
entered infrastructure state with the required confidence for a safety related function. 

--- Document Chunk 12878 ---
Rationale The operator shall have a means to reproduce origin and the reliability of the presented 

--- Document Chunk 12879 ---
data.  

--- Document Chunk 12880 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12881 ---
=> [SDR-4]: The interface for the operator shall allow to pre-schedule usage restriction areas. 

--- Document Chunk 12882 ---
Rationale In order to avoid secondary (possibly non -SIL systems) tools, or even pen & paper 

--- Document Chunk 12883 ---
solutions the system shall include safe and transparent means for pre-scheduling. 

--- Document Chunk 12884 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12885 ---
=> [SDR-5]: The operator shift handover shall include either an operational process or digital means 

--- Document Chunk 12886 ---
that prevent a loss of (safety related) information during the handover. 

--- Document Chunk 12887 ---
Guidance Ideally all relevant information as well as the handover - procedure itself are foreseen in 

--- Document Chunk 12888 ---
the operator panel/system. 

--- Document Chunk 12889 ---
Example Whenever the operator confirms a (safety related) request from any other stakeholder, this 

--- Document Chunk 12890 ---
confirmation shall contain a token (e.g., safety code) either from MBS or a trustworthy operator panel, 

--- Document Chunk 12891 ---
guaranteeing that the said intervention is either already in place or dependably pre-scheduled.   

--- Document Chunk 12892 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12893 ---
=> [SDR-6]: The operator panel should implement procedures to verify the entered usage restriction 

--- Document Chunk 12894 ---
data, before the entered data is passed to the MBS system.

--- Document Chunk 12903 ---
Interne 

--- Document Chunk 12904 ---
Rationale Since the operator is still a human being, additional procedures to verify the inputs are 

--- Document Chunk 12905 ---
recommended.  

--- Document Chunk 12906 ---
=> [SDR-7]: Entering usage restriction areas shall take priority over the regular management of 

--- Document Chunk 12907 ---
running trains 

--- Document Chunk 12908 ---
Rationale E.g., a usage restriction that was issued to late is a safety risk. 

--- Document Chunk 12909 ---
Guidance Maybe an even more general prioritization of tasks could be implemented. The life-cycle 

--- Document Chunk 12910 ---
of URAs -> is a design decision potentially influencing multiple systems. 

--- Document Chunk 12911 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12912 ---
=> [SDR-8]: The operator shall always verify with the construction team on site that the work has 

--- Document Chunk 12913 ---
actually been completed before removing the corresponding usage restriction area. 

--- Document Chunk 12914 ---
Rationale Again, possibly safety related information from/through human beings needs to be re -

--- Document Chunk 12915 ---
checked by adequate processes and rules.   

--- Document Chunk 12916 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12917 ---
=> [SDR-9]: The operator panel shall be designed to support the operator with contextual information 

--- Document Chunk 12918 ---
when executing operator commands. I.e. the operator shall be able to select the stopping position 

--- Document Chunk 12919 ---
based on an interface with information about the physical elements/tr ackside assets and select a 

--- Document Chunk 12920 ---
stopping position based on the physical elements position. 

--- Document Chunk 12921 ---
Rationale With processes that have a “human in the loop” also the feedback to this human – e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 12922 ---
its readability and its correctness - may have safety implications. 

--- Document Chunk 12923 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12924 ---
=> [SDR-10]: The operator shall receive a (visual) indication about the reported train position age. 

--- Document Chunk 12925 ---
(e.g., information outdated longer than for a defined threshold should be indicated). 

--- Document Chunk 12926 ---
Rationale Edge cases that result from timing interrelation (e.g., max. GSM-R signal roundtrip) in the 

--- Document Chunk 12927 ---
greater system need to be – at least - visible to the operator. 

--- Document Chunk 12928 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12929 ---
8.3 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS TRACKSIDE ASSESTS CONTROL & 

--- Document Chunk 12930 ---
SUPERVISION 

--- Document Chunk 12931 ---
Those UCAs are either covered with measures defined in the EULYNX specification or are directly 

--- Document Chunk 12932 ---
linked to moving trains - and thus covered by UCAs towards the onboard unit (8.1.).

8.4 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS REGARDING DOMAIN DATA & UPDATES 

--- Document Chunk 12944 ---
=> [SDR-25] DR shall include a set of verification functions that ensure that processed data follows 

--- Document Chunk 12945 ---
the required engineering rules and is not malformed. 

--- Document Chunk 12946 ---
Rationale as with [SDR-19]. 

--- Document Chunk 12947 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12948 ---
=> [SDR-19] There shall be a “safety responsible” entity which is in a valid position to verify the 

--- Document Chunk 12949 ---
correctness (correspondence to the physical reality) of the input data for MBS with a certainty 

--- Document Chunk 12950 ---
corresponding to a SIL-4 function. 

--- Document Chunk 12951 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12952 ---
Rationale With the concept of a “generic” Safety Logic the functional behavior of MBS depends on 

--- Document Chunk 12953 ---
the correctness (conformity with physical reality) of its input topography- and configuration data (here 

--- Document Chunk 12954 ---
Domain Data) from an external source. 

--- Document Chunk 12955 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12956 ---
Guidance This is a nonnegligible advantage over past and current approaches (see Figure 9). For 

--- Document Chunk 12957 ---
example, MBS allows for much greater flexibility with regards to setting MAs instead of relying on 

--- Document Chunk 12958 ---
pre-defined routes. However, since MBS cannot verify that correspondence to physical reality by 

--- Document Chunk 12959 ---
itself, an exported requirement demanding proof, as we ll as a clear path of responsibility shall be 

--- Document Chunk 12960 ---
established. 

--- Document Chunk 12961 ---
  

--- Document Chunk 12962 ---
Figure 9: Generic Safety Logic 

--- Document Chunk 12963 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12964 ---
=> [SDR-20] MBS shall include a function that ensures that the input data (here Domain Data) 

--- Document Chunk 12965 ---
received corresponds exactly to what has been verified and validated by the above (in UCA -DR-1) 

--- Document Chunk 12966 ---
mentioned safety responsible (e.g. by means of a dedicated signature or safety code). 

--- Document Chunk 12967 ---
Rationale If there are intermediaries between the entity that validated the input data for MBS and 

--- Document Chunk 12968 ---
MBS itself, then a method is required to assure that the data has not been altered/changed in 

--- Document Chunk 12969 ---
between. 

--- Document Chunk 12970 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12971 ---
Example The following figure shows how such a tracing of the safety responsibility for new 

--- Document Chunk 12972 ---
topography and configuration data could be implemented. In this case the responsibility lies with the 

--- Document Chunk 12973 ---
engineering data supplier:

Figure 10: Example for tracing of safety responsibility for topography & configuration data 

--- Document Chunk 12985 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12986 ---
=> [SDR-21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have 

--- Document Chunk 12987 ---
to be preceded by a (sufficiently large & restrictive) URA, and that this URA may only be lifted if the 

--- Document Chunk 12988 ---
changes have been updated in the topography & configuration data of MBS. 

--- Document Chunk 12989 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12990 ---
Rationale MBS lacks the information to verify that the URAs are sufficiently restrictive for the 

--- Document Chunk 12991 ---
infrastructure change to be safely performed. This verification must therefore be performed by other 

--- Document Chunk 12992 ---
means, e.g. an operational rule. 

--- Document Chunk 12993 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12994 ---
=> [SDR-22] There shall be a “safety responsible” entity which is in a valid position to define a 

--- Document Chunk 12995 ---
(sufficiently large & restrictive) URA which covers the area in said AoC which is about to change 

--- Document Chunk 12996 ---
during the upcoming data (Domain Data) update. Again, with a certainty c orresponding to a SIL -4 

--- Document Chunk 12997 ---
function. 

--- Document Chunk 12998 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 12999 ---
Rationale Similar to the correctness of topography and configuration for normal operations, it is 

--- Document Chunk 13000 ---
paramount that the URA covering the area that is about to change during an update (of Domain 

--- Document Chunk 13001 ---
Data) is sufficiently large and correct. 

--- Document Chunk 13002 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13003 ---
Alternative MBS could have a capability that allows to derive the delta between the current and the 

--- Document Chunk 13004 ---
uploaded new/next Domain data update. However, a separate (and safe) concept on how to derive 

--- Document Chunk 13005 ---
a sufficiently large URA would be required.

9 SAFETY RESULTS & CONCLUSION 

--- Document Chunk 13055 ---
9.1 STRUCTURE OF THE RESULTS 

--- Document Chunk 13056 ---
The results of this document are presented in three separate chapters:  

--- Document Chunk 13057 ---
Chapter 6  “Interface Criticality” contains the analysis of the safety relevance of the interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 13058 ---
connected directly to the MBS. The neighbouring system is specified in the name of the interface 

--- Document Chunk 13059 ---
(e.g.: I_DR is the interface between the MBS and the DR). An analysis with respect to the correctness 

--- Document Chunk 13060 ---
and integrity of the data as well as the availability of the connection was also conducted for each 

--- Document Chunk 13061 ---
interface. The following interface are listed as safety related: I_AS, I_OBU, I_OP, I_TACS.  

--- Document Chunk 13062 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13063 ---
Chapter 7 “Mapping of X2Rail Safety Analysis” covers the safety analysis results [X2RAIL-5] of the 

--- Document Chunk 13064 ---
project X2RAIL to ensure that they are adequately considered in this analysis. This is done by 

--- Document Chunk 13065 ---
analyzing each hazard from the X2Rail results and by providing a trace to different artefacts of the 

--- Document Chunk 13066 ---
STPA analysis. It can be stated that the X2RAIL results - where applicable (not bound to a S2R 

--- Document Chunk 13067 ---
specific solution) - are fully covered by the artifacts (e.g. assumptions, design recommendations, 

--- Document Chunk 13068 ---
interface analysis, ...) from this task. 

--- Document Chunk 13069 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13070 ---
Chapter 8 “Compiled Design Recommendations” contains the results of the risk analysis in Chapter 

--- Document Chunk 13071 ---
5 above, supplemented with rationale, guidance & example statements where applicable. Although 

--- Document Chunk 13072 ---
these enriched recommendations should be self -explanatory, it makes sense to look up the linked 

--- Document Chunk 13073 ---
unsafe control actions in the chapters above. They describe how such a hypothetical scenario could 

--- Document Chunk 13074 ---
have occurred and form the background for the recommendations. 

--- Document Chunk 13075 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13076 ---
9.2 STARTING POINT 

--- Document Chunk 13077 ---
The basis for this analysis was the rough system architecture that is baked into the grant agreement 

--- Document Chunk 13078 ---
as well as various sources from previous projects (see chapter 3). However, essential inputs from 

--- Document Chunk 13079 ---
system pillar were not available at the time. Thus, an own list of assumptions (see chapter 5.5) was 

--- Document Chunk 13080 ---
created, compared, mapped, and supplemented with a similar list from the system definition task 

--- Document Chunk 13081 ---
(13.1). Similarly, the operational context was rather compiled and derived from st ate-of-the-art 

--- Document Chunk 13082 ---
procedures in the participating railway companies than given from the normative side. Another factor 

--- Document Chunk 13083 ---
shaping the work in this task, were the resources at hand, and the parallelized work structure given 

--- Document Chunk 13084 ---
through the grant agreement.

9.3 POSITIONING AND OBJECTIVES 

--- Document Chunk 13096 ---
Overall, the undertaking in this task can best be compared to step 3 in the classic V-Cycle from the 

--- Document Chunk 13097 ---
CENELEC norms. 

--- Document Chunk 13098 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13099 ---
Figure 13: CENELEC V-Cycle 

--- Document Chunk 13100 ---
The first part of the original objectives stated in the grant agreement "a nalysis of the impact of the 

--- Document Chunk 13101 ---
system pillar inputs " was not feasible due to a lack of the inputs regarding the concepts and the 

--- Document Chunk 13102 ---
operational context. But the missing inputs were substituted from other sources as stated in 9.2. The 

--- Document Chunk 13103 ---
results of this task can conversely serve as input for the ongoing discussion in the system pillar. 

--- Document Chunk 13104 ---
Due to limited time and resources, the authors decided to focus on system hazards, by analyzing 

--- Document Chunk 13105 ---
the control interactions between the moving block system and the systems with which it interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 13106 ---
directly. The chosen method is explained and exemplified in chapter 5. 

--- Document Chunk 13107 ---
We expect that the results can be utilized to update the system concepts, the system definition as 

--- Document Chunk 13108 ---
well as the operational context and then further the system specification for the continuing innovation 

--- Document Chunk 13109 ---
pillar work on the Moving Block Demonstrator. Some of  the results can also be exported adjacent 

--- Document Chunk 13110 ---
work packages, like WP27 where the Digital Register is being specified, or to the demonstrator work 

--- Document Chunk 13111 ---
packages WP44/45 where operational concepts, and an operator console/workbench will come into 

--- Document Chunk 13112 ---
play. 

--- Document Chunk 13113 ---
Even though a proof of completeness with respect to functional safety is not in part of this task, we 

--- Document Chunk 13114 ---
were able to show that we cover the whole set of results from X2Rail safety work in chapter 7. 

--- Document Chunk 13115 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13116 ---
9.4 DISCUSSION OF MAIN RESULTS 

--- Document Chunk 13117 ---
An advantage of the chosen approach was that it allowed to connect the beforehand stated 

--- Document Chunk 13118 ---
assumptions with the relevant loss scenarios they affect. Some of the used assumptions were well 

--- Document Chunk 13119 ---
established (e.g., the SIL classification of the OBU, OCs), while othe rs were relatively novel (e.g., 

--- Document Chunk 13120 ---

Interne 

--- Document Chunk 13129 ---
not requiring TTDs for detection of train presence). The safety analysis therefore provided an 

--- Document Chunk 13130 ---
opportunity to validate or - if necessary - update these assumptions. 

--- Document Chunk 13131 ---
For example, under the assumption that TTDs are not required ([ASM -4]), we generated loss 

--- Document Chunk 13132 ---
scenarios for the relevant unsafe control actions to see if the hazard could still be prevented. This is 

--- Document Chunk 13133 ---
closely connected to two further assumptions about MBS: 

--- Document Chunk 13134 ---
1. Up to date knowledge of all (potential) train positions on the tracks 

--- Document Chunk 13135 ---
2. Ability to constrain all train movement within a known area (i.e., movement authority) 

--- Document Chunk 13136 ---
The respective set of loss scenarios (concerning runaway wagons, loss of communication, parking 

--- Document Chunk 13137 ---
vehicles and so on) led to the specific design recommendations [SDR -13], [SDR-16] & [SDR -18]. 

--- Document Chunk 13138 ---
The summary of those in turn leads to the conclusion, that the assumption that TTDs can completely 

--- Document Chunk 13139 ---
be eliminated while still guarding against all loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. In 

--- Document Chunk 13140 ---
short, if uncontrolled train movement cannot be eliminated, their presence is still required. 

--- Document Chunk 13141 ---
Henceforth, [ASM-4] was upd ated to [ASM -4-v2] “MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train 

--- Document Chunk 13142 ---
movement but supports them for migration purposes or systems where the chance of uncontrolled 

--- Document Chunk 13143 ---
movement cannot be sufficiently controlled by other means.” 

--- Document Chunk 13144 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13145 ---
A second class of assumptions is concerned with the correspondence between reported data and 

--- Document Chunk 13146 ---
physical reality. This includes assumptions about the reported train length ([ASM -8]) as well as the 

--- Document Chunk 13147 ---
geographical position of infrastructure elements like points, tracks, etc. ([ASM-26]). For train length, 

--- Document Chunk 13148 ---
partial validation is possible in the case of splitting or joining trains. However, the validation alone 

--- Document Chunk 13149 ---
may not be sufficient to achieve the desired level of confidence required for a SIL 4 function (e.g., if 

--- Document Chunk 13150 ---
two trains enter the same TTD section and maneuvers like joining, splitting, or turning take place). 

--- Document Chunk 13151 ---
Thus [SDR-11] states that “MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected 

--- Document Chunk 13152 ---
(i.e. due to splitting and joining).” 

--- Document Chunk 13153 ---
The correctness of information on the geographical position of infrastructure elements is even more 

--- Document Chunk 13154 ---
critical for MBS. Some controller constraints depend on geometrical information (e.g. ensuring that 

--- Document Chunk 13155 ---
there are no intersections between movement authorities,  [Resp-MBS-1]) which need the required 

--- Document Chunk 13156 ---
level of precision to ensure that no intersections are undetected. MBS lacks the information to 

--- Document Chunk 13157 ---
validate the provided information by itself, but depends on it for SIL -4 functions. Thus, the 

--- Document Chunk 13158 ---
corresponding assumption [ASM-26] has the rank of exported requirement, provided in a higher level 

--- Document Chunk 13159 ---
of granularity through the design recommendations [SDR-18] to [SDR-24]. 

--- Document Chunk 13160 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13161 ---
The third class of results concerns the control loops where a human actor is involved. Several design 

--- Document Chunk 13162 ---
recommendations in section 8.4 concern the Operator Panel, its ability to display safety related 

--- Document Chunk 13163 ---
information, to re -verify human entered values, to schedu le safety related commands, or more 

--- Document Chunk 13164 ---
general operational procedures that could be linked to respective loss scenarios in our analysis. 

--- Document Chunk 13165 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 13166 ---
9.5 OPEN POINTS AND FUTURE WORK 

--- Document Chunk 13167 ---
Even though the major pain points were likely highlighted in this analysis, they are not yet verifiably 

--- Document Chunk 13168 ---
settled or solved. In that regard, the design recommendations will have to be considered in the 

--- Document Chunk 13169 ---
system definitions of MBS, DR and the Operator Panel - to be then re-checked/validated in a further

step of the safety analysis (e.g., protection against side-on collisions; domain data safety responsible 

--- Document Chunk 13180 ---
entity). 

--- Document Chunk 13181 ---
Some of the assumptions defined at the beginning of the work packages simplified the analysis and 

--- Document Chunk 13182 ---
might have to be re -opened in a later stage when extending the system scope (e.g., SIL of train 

--- Document Chunk 13183 ---
length / train integrity information; handover to neighboring MBS- or legacy systems). Finally, there 

--- Document Chunk 13184 ---
are some use -cases that were postponed to a later stage of the demonstrator (e.g., supervised 

--- Document Chunk 13185 ---
shunting) that must be analyzed as soon as first concept drafts are available. 

--- Document Chunk 13186 ---
The results of the safety analysis review from D13.1 will be further developed and addressed within 

--- Document Chunk 13187 ---
WP14. Regarding any form of proof of completeness, e.g., for a later certification will likely have to 

--- Document Chunk 13188 ---
move to a possible second phase of the R2DATO project.
