--- Document Chunk 6 ---
The railway system is made up of various subsystems which interact to deliver the required outputs, 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
normally the movement of passengers and freight. The way these systems interact all have a role to 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
play in the safe and efficient running of the overall railway. Railway control and communications 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
systems are designed and operated whilst taking into account their interactions with related 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
systems. This article gives an overview of the interfaces and interactions between railway control 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
and communications systems and the related subsystems in the railway environment. 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
Prominent subsystems are: 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
• Signalling; 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
• Telecommunications; 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
• Operations, including control centres, passenger information and public address systems; 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
• Drivers; 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
• Rolling stock; 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
• Permanent way / track – including the rails, fasteners, sleepers and ballast / slab track as 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
well as on-track train detection & monitoring systems; 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
• Civil Engineering structures, including bridges, tunnels and stations; 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
• Electric traction supply; 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
• Electric power systems; 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
• Evacuation systems.  

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
During the life of a railway system, changes will be made either to enhance its capacity and 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
capability, renew life expired assets or add new services. When making changes to one part of the 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
system it is essential that the impacts of the change on other parts of the system are considered if 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
the overall system is to continue to perform its functions safely and correctly. 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Operations 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
Control Centres and Signallers 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
The railway is controlled by signallers at signalling control centres who input their instructions via a 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
control device, such as a computer screen, control panel or lever frame into the interlocking. After 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
checking the instructions are safe, the interlocking passes the instructions on to the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
infrastructure. It is important that the state of the infrastructure is feed back to the signaller in the 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
form of indications on the computer display screen, indications panel, positions of the levers or by 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
simply looking out of the window! 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
The interfaces with the signaller are described in more detail in the Back to Basics Article “Operator 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
Interfaces” (IRSE News, Issue 269, September 2020). 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
Train Describers 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
To set the correct route for a train, the signaller needs to know the identities of the individual trains 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
as they enter, pass through and leave the control area. Each train is allocated a train reporting 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---

--- Document Chunk 47 ---

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
number, to identify the train. The train reporting number allocates each train a unique identity 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
which may be based on a combination of the train type, destination, operating company and an 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
identity number.  

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
The train reporting numbers are initially entered into the system by the operator, which may be a 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
signaller, or depot controller at the start of the train’s journey. The train describer then uses 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
information from the interlocking about the status of the signalling system to “step” the train 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
through the control area. At the fringes of the control area, the information is passed to adjacent 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
train describers via a telecoms link. 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
The train reporting numbers can be manually altered, or interposed by a signaller if required. This 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
may occur when a train has reached the end of its timetabled service and needs to start a new one, 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
when a train divides to form two separate services or two trains join to make one. 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
The train describer system is not safety critical, as the interlocking protects trains from unsafe 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
movements if a train is misrouted. 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
Passenger Information & Public Address Systems 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
A passenger information system delivers real-time information to passengers about the nature and 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
state of the railway. The customer interface usually consists of: 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
• visual information display screens at stations and on trains; 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
• audio announcements at stations and on trains; 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
• mobile phone applications; and 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
• railway operator or travel planner websites.  

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
Passenger information and automated public address systems usually take their inputs from the 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
train describer and the timetable information to create real-time data. More information on 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
passenger information systems can be found in the Back to Basics article “Telecoms Part 2” (IRSE 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
News, Issue 271, November 2020). 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Drivers 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
There are several train-borne systems that perform the role of interfacing between the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
system and the train driver. 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
Automatic Train Protection 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
Automatic train protection systems are designed to prevent or mitigate the consequences of trains 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
passing signals at danger, over-speeding or overrunning buffer stops. Examples include: train stops 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
on metro systems, the Automatic Warning System used in UK and Australia, or the European Train 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
Control System.  

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
An automatic train protection system take information about the status of the signalling system, 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
such as signal aspects, issued movement authorities or permissible speed information. The system 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
automatically intervenes if trains are travelling too quickly to safely stop at a signal at danger or 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
buffer stop, or decelerate sufficiently for a speed restriction. The intervention may consist of an 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
alarm and/or visual indication in the driver’s cab, or go further and automatically apply the brakes 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
until either the train has slowed sufficiently or stopped completely, depending on the system 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
installed. 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
Automatic Train Operation 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
Automatic Train Operation is used to help automate the operation of trains and can vary in the 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
degree of automation offered. This varies from no automation at the lowest level, to full 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
Page 3 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
automation, including starting and stopping of trains, operation of doors and handling of emergency 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
situations. It is primarily in use in metro systems, but is becoming more widespread on mainline 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
railways. Automatic Train Operation takes input from the signalling system to determine how far 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
ahead the line is clear, and trackside beacons that transmit brake commands to the train. The train’s 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
on-board computer calculates the required the braking curve to bring the train to a stand at the 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
correct position in platforms or at junctions. The braking calculations are updated frequently to 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
ensure accuracy.  

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
Driver Advisory System 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
The driver advisory system aims to optimise the driving of the train, saving energy and improving 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
performance. The system consists of a control centre subsystem that evaluates timetable 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
information and routing strategies, and sends the processed information to the train. The train’s on-

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
board subsystem uses this information to calculate energy efficient speed profiles to achieve train 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
timings and issues advice to the driver. Some of these systems are static, so the information is 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
received by the on-board subsystem at the start of the journey, whilst others are connected to the 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
control centre subsystem during the journey and updated dynamically via radio. 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
Secure Train to Signal Box Radio 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
Secure train to signal box radio (including GSM-R) is used to communicate between the train and the 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
control centre. The driver is provided with an in-cab terminal which can be used to display and send 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
messages or voice communications between the driver and operational staff. More information on 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
secure train to signal box radio systems can be found in the Back to Basics article “Telecoms Part 1” 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
(IRSE News, Issue 270, October 2020). 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Rolling Stock 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
Braking Characteristics 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
The braking characteristics of the rolling stock vary between train types, with some having much 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
better braking performance, such as modern passenger trains, than others, such as heavy freight 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
trains. Signals are required to be positioned such that the space between the first caution signal and 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
a signal at danger is sufficient for all train types authorised to run that route, with sufficient warning 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
to stop (plus a safety margin).  

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
In some cases, the signal spacing would allow for trains with better braking performance to run at 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
higher speeds than others, whilst still maintaining sufficient distances between signals. In these 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
cases those trains may be permitted to travel at a higher speed.  

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
The braking characteristics of the rolling stock authorised to run on a route also impact on signing of 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
maximum permissible speeds. Where there is a large reduction in maximum permissible speed, 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
sufficient warnings for the speed reduction needs to be given for the trains to slow to the lower 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
speed. This may be via lineside signage, or restrictive signal aspects to force a train to slow down. 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
Page 4 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
The braking characteristics of trains impact on the design and efficacy of automatic train protection 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
systems. Some train protection systems evaluate train speed against the distance to a speed 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
restriction or signal at danger and intervenes or sounds a warning if the train is travelling too quickly 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
to brake sufficiently. 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
For trains fitted with in-cab signalling systems, movement authorities are issued via radio and 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
displayed in the cab for the driver. The train’s on-board system calculates braking curves using speed 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
restriction information, train current position and speed, train braking characteristics and the 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
distance to the end of movement authority. The system warns the driver of possible over-speeding 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
and may intervene by applying the brakes to slow the train if it is necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
Definition of Track Clearance Points 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
With track-based train detection systems, such as track circuits, treadles or axle counters, the 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
position of the train is determined by the positions of its wheels. At the front and rear of a train or 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
locomotive, there is an overhang between the end of the train and the nearest axle. At junctions or 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
conflicts, the position of axle counters or insulated rail joints need to be positioned accounting for 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
the overhang so that the signalling system can detect a train fouling an adjacent line. 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Permanent Way 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
Gradient 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
Gradients affect the ability of trains to accelerate or decelerate because gravity acts on the mass of 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
the train. The ability to maintain safe train separation needs to take gradient into account, which 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
affects the lineside signal spacing or the limit of movement authority in in-cab signalling applications.  

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
Where gradients are falling in the direction of travel (downhill), the spacing between signals needs 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
to be increased to allow for longer braking distances. This is of particular importance for freight 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
trains. Where gradients are rising (uphill), the spacing between signals can be reduced due to 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
shorter braking distances. 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
Positioning a signal at the bottom or part way up a steep rising gradient should be avoided because 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
of the time taken to accelerate and possible wheel slip during poor adhesion conditions. This is 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
particularly important for heavy freight trains or where trains may be required to stop frequently. 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
Page 5 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
In metro systems, sometimes the stations are designed to be at the top of a rising gradient. This 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
helps to reduce braking effort to stop the train and the consequential heat generation from braking. 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
Curvature and Cant 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
Track curvature impacts a train driver’s ability to see a signal, particularly in an urban environment 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
or underground where there are considerably more obstructions. A straight alignment means that 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
drivers can see the signal from some distance away. This may also have its own problems, 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
particularly where there are shorter signal sections and it becomes possible for the driver to see 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
several signals along the line of route and read one further away in error. This problem may be 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
mitigated by adjusting the intensity and range of the signals so that signals that are further away 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
appear less bright until the train is sufficiently close. 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
Another problem arises where there are several lines running in the same direction and it is difficult 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
for a driver to identify which line the signal applies to. This problem can be mitigated by placing 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
signals parallel to one another, by providing additional reading distance for the signals, or by 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
mounting signals on the other side of the line to increase separation between signal aspects. 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
Cant is the slope of the track across the rails, where the outer rail of a curve is positioned higher 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
than the inner rail, providing a banked turn; thus allowing trains to move through the curve at a 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
higher speed than would otherwise be possible. This consequentially affects the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
permissible speed on the line, signal spacing and required sighting distances. The cant can cause 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
issues with cable routing or, at level crossings, uneven cross track profiles for road users.  

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
Switches and Crossings 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
Switches and crossings, or sets of points, allow trains to change between lines or tracks. The switch 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
is the part of a crossover that physically moves whereas the crossing is the fixed element of the 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
crossover. The blades of the switches are moved via a series of rods by electric point machines or 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
hand-operated mechanical levers. 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
A simple set of points consists of four rails. The two outside rails (stock rails) are fixed. The two 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
inside rails (switch rails) can move from side to side at one end. For a train to safely pass through a 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
set of points, one side of the switch must be physically touching the stock rail and the other switch 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
rail must allow sufficient space for the train’s wheels to pass between it and the other stock rail. 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
The crossing section of a set of points is usually a cast lump of metal which allows breaks in the 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
running rails sufficient to allow the flange of the wheels to cross the running rail of the other track. A 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
check rail help keep the train’s wheels on the track where there is a risk that the train could move 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
laterally. The check rail simply guides the wheel by applying a barrier to the wheel. 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
A common arrangement of points connects two parallel lines of a double track railway. This 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
combination is known as a ‘crossover’ and both point ends are often worked together under one 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
control so that they are always in correspondence with one another, that is, both set for the straight 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
route, or both set for the route over the crossover. Crossovers, and some other arrangements of 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
crossings are illustrated on the next page. 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
Simple crossover between two parallel lines. 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
Flat crossing, where two low speed lines cross. 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
There is no useable connection between the 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
two lines. 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
Switch diamond, for higher speed junctions. 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
There is no useable connection between the 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
two lines. 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
Single slip, where two tracks cross and it is 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
possible to move from one line to the other.  

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
Double slips have a slip on each side. 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
Point Machines 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
Points can be controlled by direct connection to a control lever, such as in a mechanical signal box or 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
ground frame, where the movement of the points are under the direct control of a human. 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
More commonly, the points are driven by a point machine, powered by an electric motor or 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
hydraulic system, with the movements controlled by the interlocking. In both cases, when the points 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
are in use, they are required to be locked in position, so that the points cannot be moved by the 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
signalling system or the vibration of the train. This is particularly important when they are facing 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
points and helps to prevent derailment and damage to the points. 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
The interlocking must know the position of the point blades, to check that the points are in the 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
correct position for the safe movement of trains and have not failed or become obstructed. An 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
individual detector rod is attached between the point blades and point machine that proves the 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
position of the point blades by making the appropriate contacts within the point machine. If the 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
blades are out by as little as a few millimetres, the rods will not be in the correct position and will 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
prevent the contacts operating. The state of the contacts is fed back to the interlocking so that the 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
signalling system is aware of the lie of the points. 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
Other types of point machine exist that apply locking and prove point lie in different ways, but the 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
requirement for locking and detection of points is essentially the same.  

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
Catch/Trap Points 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
It is sometimes necessary to derail a train deliberately to protect against potential collision with 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
another train.  

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
Catch points are designed to derail anything running against the normal direction of traffic, such as 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
loose wagons that have no or ineffective brakes and have “run away”. The spring catch point 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
consists of one point blade, normally open in the derailing position. A train moving in the normal 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
direction will push the point blade closed against a spring and continue unimpeded. A train moving 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
in the wrong direction will derail at the spring catch. Another type of catch point is the wide-to-

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
Page 7 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
gauge type, consisting of two switches that work in opposite directions with the switches either both 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
open or both closed. These are operated by the signalling system and a train travelling over these 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
points whilst in the open position will be derailed. 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
Trap points protect lines from trains on adjacent lines that have passed a signal at danger, typically 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
at the exit from sidings or freight loop lines. They are controlled by the interlocking, with locking and 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
detection of point lie fed back to the signalling system. 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
Junctions 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
Where two railway lines meet, there is potential for conflict between trains. Signals, or limits of 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
movement authority are required close to junctions to prevent trains traversing the junction when it 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
is not safe to do so and to authorise trains to traverse the junction when it is safe.  

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
Signals are usually placed with a safety margin (overlap) between the signal and any potential points 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
of conflict to protect trains traversing the junction from a train overrunning one of the protecting 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
signals due to an error in braking judgement. It is undesirable for signals to be placed at very long 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
distances from the junctions because this would reduce the junction capacity due to the increased 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
time required for a train to clear the junction after being given a movement authority. 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
Track-Based Train Detection 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
Train detection systems are described in more detail in the Back to Basics Article “Train Detection – 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
the Basics” (IRSE News, Issue 261, December 2019). 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
Other Rail-Mounted Equipment 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
Other equipment than can be placed on the track/ between the rails includes: 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
• Axle counters. These count the number of axles passing over a given point. They are 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
clamped to one of the rails and their location can be constrained by, for example, the 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
presence of check rails or third rails for traction power. 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
• Train protection systems. There are many different systems, but all involve track mounted 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
equipment sending information to the train by electrical, magnetic or physical means. 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
• ETCS (European Train Control System), CBTC (Communications Based Train Control) and 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
automatic driving systems. These typically require equipment fixed to the sleepers between 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
the rails to transmit to or receive information from trains. The equipment can include 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
beacons or transmitters (often known as balises or transponders) and loops of cable.  

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
Page 8 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
• Hot axle box detectors. These consist of infrared scanners that measure the abnormal levels 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
of heat generated by failing bearings in axle boxes. Failed bearings cause the axle to seize 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
and can cause derailment, so early detection is essential. 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
• Other items can be fitted to the sleepers rather than the rails such as beacons for on board 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
train announcements or speed restrictions and loops of cable for coded track circuits. 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Civil Engineering Structures 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
There are many structures around a railway line, either forming part of the railway or forming the 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
surrounding environment. Sometimes the position, size or nature of those structures impact on how 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
the signalling system is designed, constructed, maintained or operated.  

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
Tunnels, Viaducts and Bridges 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
Tunnels impact greatly on the ability to position signalling and telecoms equipment. Sometimes this 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
is unavoidable, such as with the underground metro systems found in many cities worldwide. It is 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
preferable for trains not to stop within tunnels or on viaducts due to the risks associated with 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
evacuating a train in these places. Where reasonably practical to do so, signals are placed so that no 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
part of the train is within a tunnel, viaduct, or anywhere else with limited clearance.  

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
Tunnels and viaducts also present a challenge for the installation and maintenance of equipment, 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
due to difficult access for staff, particularly if the tunnel or viaduct is long. 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
Limited clearance within tunnels can make it very difficult to place signals clear of the train’s 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
kinematic envelope, and this is sometimes managed by using special, smaller tunnel signals. 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
The ability of a driver to see signals at the minimum reading distance can be adversely affected by 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
the walls of the tunnels, particularly if clearance within the tunnel is tight, or the tunnel is curved. It 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
can be difficult for a driver to see the aspect displayed by a signal against a sunlit background if it is 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
placed close to the exit of a tunnel, especially if the tunnel is long or narrow. 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
Bridges can also affect the ability of drivers to see signals immediately beyond it, as they may be 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
obscured by the walls or span of the bridge.  

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
Stations and Lineside Buildings 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
If a passenger train is stopped at a signal and any part of the train is within a station platform, 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
passengers may attempt to board or alight the train. This is a particular problem if the train’s doors 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
are not centrally locked. For this reason, stop signals are generally either positioned at the end of 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
platforms or at least a train length beyond the end of the platform. Signals placed at the platform 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
ends are preferably 20-25m from the stopping position of the train so that they can easily be seen by 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
the driver when the train is stationary. 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
A driver must be able to read, interpret and understand a signal aspect for a sufficient distance on 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
the approach. However, buildings, platform furniture, waiting shelters, canopies and passenger 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
standing on the platforms can adversely affect this, particularly if the platform is curved. To aid the 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
driver, an additional signal can be provided on the approach to the station, or part-way along the 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
platform to give the driver an early indication of the next signal aspect. 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
The proximity of platforms to the railway line can make installation, inspection and maintenance of 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
lineside equipment difficult. Where practical to do to, equipment such as train detection equipment 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
are placed clear of the platforms so that staff can work on equipment in a position of safety.

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
In built up residential areas, where noise may be a problem for residents nearby, unnecessary 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
railway-related noise must be kept to a minimum. The audible alarms on level crossings may sound 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
at a lower level at night, or restrictions on the use of train horns on the approach to footpath 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
crossings may be imposed, enforced by signage or regional / national operating instructions. 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
Other Limitations on Signalling Equipment 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
Other structures that can also impact on the sighting of lineside signals include electrification 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
gantries, large signal gantries or pipe bridges. 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
Trains should not stop on level crossings unless it is unavoidable, so signals need to be positioned so 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
that they would not cause a train to obstruct the crossing when standing at the signal. Vandalism is 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
also a risk at level crossings, so all equipment should be a sufficient distance from the crossing, 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
ideally placed beyond security gates and anti-trespass guards / devices. 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Electrification and Power Systems 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
Traction Power Supplies 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
 Traction power is delivered by means of an overhead wire or at ground level via a third (live) rail 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
close to the running rails, and collected by the train by a roof-mounted pantograph or rail-level pick-

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
up shoe. To create a complete circuit, there is a traction return, which can take several forms. 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
Third or Fourth Rail Electrification 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
Where traction power is delivered by a third rail, the return current is carried by the running rails, or 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
alternatively via a fourth conducting rail. The latter mechanism can be seen in the London 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
Underground or Milan Metro. 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
One of the difficulties with using one of the running rails for traction return is that the running rail 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
may also form part of the signalling train detection circuits. In this case there is the need for the 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
signalling equipment to be able to distinguish between the traction current and the track circuit 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
current. Train detection boundaries must also allow the traction return current to flow past the 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
boundary to the next track section, but prevent the flow of track circuit current across the boundary. 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
For more information on how this is achieved, refer to the Back to Basics article “Train Detection – 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
the Basics” (IRSE News, Issue 261, December 2019). 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
Overhead Line Electrification 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
Early versions of overhead line electrification also used the running rails to carry the traction return 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
current. A major issue with this is that any conductor carrying a current generates a magnetic field 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
that can induce a voltage in nearby cables, particularly if they run alongside the conductor for great 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
distances, as is often the case with signalling and telecoms cables. To overcome this, the running 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
rails can be electrically bonded so that the return current is shared amongst all running rails in the 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
vicinity, reducing the current in each individual rail. This reduces the level of electromagnetic 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
interference in the signalling and telecoms cables. An advantage of this is that traction current takes 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
multiple paths so, in the event of a rail break, the traction return can return to its source by an 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
alternative path. 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
To reduce the amount of electromagnetic interference, a dedicated return conductor wire is 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
provided, running parallel to the overhead line at approximately the same height. The return 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
conductor is bonded to the running rails so that it carries some of the traction return current. The 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
current in the return conductor flows in the opposite direction to the overhead line, so the 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
electromagnetic fields generated by the return conductor partially cancels that generated by the 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
Page 10 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
overhead line. The current carried by the return conductor is weaker than the overhead lines, so 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
there is still potential for interference in the lineside signalling and telecoms cables. 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
Electromagnetic interference in lineside cables can be reduced further by using booster 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
transformers, which force nearly all of the traction return current from the rails to the return 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
conductor. This increases the distance between potential sources of electromagnetic interference 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
and other lineside cables, and consequently reduces the level of interference between them. 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
 Neutral Sections 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
Sources of traction power (feeder stations) need to be electrically insulated from one another, so a 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
neutral section is provided where no traction power is supplied. This is sufficiently long to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
that no train can be electrically connected to two separate supplies simultaneously, but not so long 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
that a train will not have enough energy to reach the next live section. 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
It is important that the signalling system is designed such that no train ever comes to a stand within 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
a neutral section, as any electric train would not be able to accelerate away again. 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
Immunisation 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
The effects of induction in signalling circuits can be limited by designing the signalling circuits and 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
equipment to be immune from the unwanted currents. This is particularly important in the design of 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
train detection systems where track circuits are used. In areas of AC electrification, DC track circuits 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
may be used, and vice versa. Alternatively, AC track circuits can be used that have no harmonics in 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
common with the traction current, enabling the track circuit receiver to distinguish between the 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
track circuit current and any traction current that may be present in the rails. 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
Signal Sighting 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
Overhead line equipment can affect the ability of a train driver to read and interpret lineside signals 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
and signs when they are obscured by equipment, even if just momentarily. This is a particular 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
problem where overhead line masts are on the inside of curves and may be overcome with the use 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
of cantilever structures for the overhead line masts or alterations to the positions of signals and 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
lineside signs. 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
Equipotential Bonding and Earthing 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
To protect lineside signalling equipment against contact with the traction supply, either directly, 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
such as when overhead wires come down, or indirectly, such as when other equipment is made live 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
by an electrical fault, signalling equipment is bonded to earth.  

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
In areas electrified by overhead line, any metal equipment beneath or near the overhead line is 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
bonded to a running rail carrying traction return current so that if the wires carrying the traction 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
current were to fall, the equipment is earthed via the running rail, protecting the equipment from 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
damage and staff and public from electric shock. 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
In third/fourth rail electrified and non-electrified areas it is not usual practice to bond all metal 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
structures to the traction return rail. 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
Signalling & Telecoms Power Supplies 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
Signalling and telecoms power supplies must provide a constant, stable supply for the correct 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
operation of equipment. It must also be safe for the staff to work on, with measures in place to 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
protect staff and the public from electric shock under fault conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
Signalling equipment within apparatus cases must be earthed to protect staff and equipment from 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
electric shock from contact with exposed conductive parts, such as circuitry, and other conductive 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
Interfaces and Interactions between Railway Control & Communications and Related Systems 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
Page 11 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
parts that could be made live by an electrical fault. Other protective measures include enclosing high 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
voltage equipment in insulated units, providing insulated covers for live parts or insulating 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
conductors. 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
Signalling and telecoms equipment is commonly powered by a dedicated supply, and may be backed 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
up by an uninterruptible power supply in case of failure of the supply point, to allow time to change 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
to an alternative supply.  

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
Interfaces and Interactions with Evacuation Systems 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
Signalling systems must be designed to minimise the risks associated with emergency evacuation of 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
trains or railway infrastructure. The system should be designed to minimise the risk that an 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
evacuation takes place in an area where it is difficult for passengers to exit a stricken train. It is also 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
important that access to the site is possible for emergency services and rescue teams to provide 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
assistance. For this reason, signals within tunnels, viaducts or steep cuttings are avoided if practical 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
to do so. 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
The signalling system may also be required to respond quickly to protect a hazard, such as a train 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
crash or fire. In many cases, trains involved in an incident may already be protected by the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
system. However, there may be a requirement for passengers to exit the train in a hazardous area 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
(or indeed they may do it contrary to instructions) and the signaller will require a mechanism for 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
protecting the site – by replacing all signals in the area to danger or sending an “all trains stop” 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
command via the radio, for example. Emergency communication and signalling intervention is 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
essential to prevent further problems or disaster. 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
