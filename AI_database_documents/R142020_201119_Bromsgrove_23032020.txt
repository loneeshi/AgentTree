Preface

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
The purpose of a Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation is to 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
improve railway safety by preventing future railway accidents or by mitigating their 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
consequences.  It is not the purpose of such an investigation to establish blame or 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
liability. Accordingly, it is inappropriate that RAIB reports should be used to assign 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
fault or blame, or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
process has been undertaken for that purpose.

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
RAIB’s findings are based on its own evaluation of the evidence that was available at 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
the time of the investigation and are intended to explain what happened, and why, in a 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
fair and unbiased manner. 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
Where RAIB has described a factor as being linked to cause and the term is 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
unqualified, this means that RAIB has satisfied itself that the evidence supports both 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
the presence of the factor and its direct relevance to the causation of the accident or 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
incident that is being investigated. However, where RAIB is less confident about the 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
existence of a factor, or its role in the causation of the accident or incident, RAIB will 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
qualify its findings by use of words such as ‘probable’ or ‘possible’, as appropriate.  

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
Where there is more than one potential explanation RAIB may describe one factor as 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
being ‘more’ or ‘less’ likely than the other.

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
In some cases factors are described as ‘underlying’. Such factors are also relevant 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
to the causation of the accident or incident but are associated with the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
management arrangements or organisational issues (such as working culture).  

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
Where necessary, words such as ‘probable’ or ‘possible’ can also be used to qualify 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
‘underlying factor’.

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
Use of the word ‘probable’ means that, although it is considered highly likely that the 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
factor applied, some small element of uncertainty remains. Use of the word ‘possible’ 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
means that, although there is some evidence that supports this factor, there remains a 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
more significant degree of uncertainty.

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
An ‘observation’ is a safety issue discovered as part of the investigation that is not 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
considered to be causal or underlying to the accident or incident being investigated, 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
but does deserve scrutiny because of a perceived potential for safety learning.  

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
The above terms are intended to assist readers’ interpretation of the report, and to 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
provide suitable explanations where uncertainty remains. The report should therefore 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
be interpreted as the view of RAIB, expressed with the sole purpose of improving 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
railway safety. 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
Any information about casualties is based on figures provided to RAIB from various 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
sources.  Considerations of personal privacy may mean that not all of the actual 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
effects of the event are recorded in the report. RAIB recognises that sudden 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
unexpected events can have both short- and long-term consequences for the physical 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
and/or mental health of people who were involved, both directly and indirectly, in what 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
happened.

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
RAIB’s investigation (including its scope, methods, conclusions and recommendations) 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
is independent of any inquest or fatal accident inquiry, and all other investigations, 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
including those carried out by the safety authority, police or railway industry.

Summary

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
At about 22:44 hrs on Monday 23 March 2020, the 21:05 Cardiff Central to 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
Birmingham New Street service collided with a class 66 locomotive that had derailed 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
at the end of a siding, south of Bromsgrove station. The passenger train suffered 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
significant damage along one side of all three vehicles, although it did not derail. There 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
were four passengers and two crew on board the passenger train and none reported 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
any injuries.

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
The locomotive had just arrived in the siding and was to act as a ‘banking’ locomotive, 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
assisting heavy freight trains up the 1 in 37 Lickey incline, to the north of Bromsgrove 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
station. It derailed after running through the buffer stop at the end of the siding and 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
came to rest fouling the main line. The driver of the locomotive was not injured in the 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
collision, although the locomotive suffered damage to the corner of the leading cab.

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
The driver did not stop the locomotive before it reached the buffer stop because he 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
became distracted from the driving task by personal issues arising from the national 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
COVID-19 lockdown announced earlier that evening. 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
The collision occurred because there was insufficient time between the locomotive 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
derailment and the passenger train’s arrival for the alarm to be raised and the 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
passenger train to be stopped.

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
RAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail to review its processes and 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
standards for managing buffer stop collision risk on non-platform terminal tracks.

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
RAIB has also identified three learning points for drivers, relating to compliance with 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
mobile phone policies in the driving cab, informing signallers of accidents and safe exit 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
from trains during an incident.

The accident

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
Summary of the accident 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
3 At about 22:44 hrs on Monday 23 March 2020, a locomotive collided with the 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
buffer stop at the end of a siding about 700 metres south of Bromsgrove station. 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
The locomotive derailed and came to a stop foul of the adjacent main line. Less 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
than a minute later, a northbound passenger train collided with the corner of the 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
locomotive, but did not derail. The passenger train came to a stop between the 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
locomotive and Bromsgrove station.

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
4 No-one was hurt. 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
5 The passenger train suffered extensive damage to one side of all three vehicles. 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
The front left corner of the leading vehicle was particularly damaged in the area 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
of the driver’s door. The locomotive suffered damage to the front left corner of the 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
leading cab. There was also damage to the underside of the locomotive and this 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
resulted in a diesel fuel spill during recovery (figure 1).

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
6 The buffer stop, and the associated track at the end of the siding, was also 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
damaged during the collision.

Location

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
7 The accident occurred at 56 miles and 8 chains, at the end of the up Bromsgrove 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
neck siding, about 700 metres to the south of Bromsgrove station on the Bristol 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
to Birmingham main line (figures 2 and 3). This is a siding which is routinely used 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
by locomotives waiting to assist heavy freight trains up the 1:37 Lickey incline, 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
a practice referred to as ‘banking’. The siding runs parallel to the up Gloucester 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
main line and ends at a buffer stop.

8 At this location, the maximum permitted speed on the up Gloucester main line is 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
90 mph (144 km/h). The maximum permitted speed on the up Bromsgrove neck 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
siding is 15 mph (24 km/h). The siding and main line are on a downhill gradient of 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
1 in 283 and a gentle right-hand curve, in the direction of travel of the locomotive. 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
9 The signalling in the area is controlled from the Bromsgrove workstation which 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
is located at the West Midlands Signalling Centre. Although the line from 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
Birmingham as far as Bromsgrove station is electrified, the location of the 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
accident is beyond the end of the electrified area. 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
Organisations involved

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
10 DB Cargo (UK) Limited was the owner and operator of the locomotive and the 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
employer of the locomotive driver. 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
11 XC Trains Limited (trading as CrossCountry) was the operator of the passenger 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
train and the employer of the staff on board it. 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
investigation.  

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
Trains involved

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
The locomotive

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
14 The diesel locomotive that derailed, 66057, was part of a small sub-fleet of class 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
66 locomotives that had been modified to undertake banking duties on the Lickey 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
incline. A banking locomotive is moved against, and sometimes coupled to, the 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
rear of trains requiring assistance, in Bromsgrove station (paragraph 7), before 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
helping to provide power up the incline. If the banking locomotive has coupled 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
to the train, a remote coupler release is operated, disconnecting it on the move, 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
when the train has reached the top of the incline. The train then continues, and 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
the banking locomotive returns down the incline to Bromsgrove, ready for further 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
duties.

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
15 On the night of the accident the locomotive was due to bank its first freight train 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
from Bromsgrove at around midnight.

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
The passenger train

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
16 The passenger train was a three-car class 170 ‘Turbostar’ diesel multiple unit, 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
number 170107. CrossCountry reported that there were 4 passengers on board at 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
the time, including an off-duty DB Cargo driver, as well as two train crew.

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
17 It was operating service 1M87,1 the 21:05 hrs train from Cardiff Central to 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
Birmingham New Street. The train had left Worcestershire Parkway station about 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
12 minutes before reaching Bromsgrove, and was running about 2 minutes late. 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
Its next scheduled stop was at Birmingham New Street.

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
Rail equipment/systems involved

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
18 The buffer stop consisted of a metal framework that was fixed to the jointed rails. 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
It did not contain any sliding friction elements or hydraulic buffers. It was fitted 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
with two permanently illuminated red lights (figure 4).

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
19 The buffer stop was installed in its current location (figure 5) around 2004, as 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
identified from historic satellite imagery. Prior to this, the siding had ended in a 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
buffer stop located about 90 metres further south. 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
Staff involved

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
20 The driver of the locomotive had worked on the railway for 18 years, with 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
14 of those driving for DB Cargo and its predecessors. He held the relevant 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
competencies for driving class 66 locomotives and his route knowledge for the 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
route to Bromsgrove was up-to-date. He regularly worked this shift, operating the 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
banking locomotive to and from Bromsgrove. DB Cargo stated that there were no 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
significant safety-related incidents on the driver’s record. 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
21 The driver of the passenger train had been driving trains for 44 years. 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
CrossCountry reported that there were no significant safety-related incidents on 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
his record.

temperatures of between 2°C and 4°C recorded at local weather stations.

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
23 There was very little local illumination and no significant sources of noise nearby.

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
24 It is possible that if the accident had occurred during the hours of daylight, the 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
driver might have seen the locomotive slightly earlier, and been able to reduce the 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
collision speed a little. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any other 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
external circumstances affected the accident.

The sequence of events

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
Events preceding the accident

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
25 The locomotive driver had last worked on the previous Saturday, two days before 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
the accident. He worked the night shift, getting home at around 08:30 hrs on the 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
Sunday morning, and rested until about midday. He spent the rest of the day at 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
home, going to bed at around 23:30 hrs.

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
26 He woke at about 08:00 hrs on the Monday morning and did not try to sleep 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
during the day.

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
27 At 20:30 hrs, the driver watched the Prime Minister make a statement on 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
television relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the statement which 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
instructed people to stay at home, except for limited, predefined reasons, and that 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
no-one was allowed to meet with friends or family unless they lived in the same 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
household. Immediately after watching this broadcast, the locomotive driver set 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
off to work, which was a 20-minute drive away.

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
28 While en-route to work, the driver received a phone call from a family 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
member and there was a worried discussion about what the earlier televised 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
announcement would mean for his childcare arrangements.

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
29 The driver arrived at Bescot yard, near Walsall, and booked on punctually, by 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
telephone, at 21:11 hrs. He prepared the locomotive and departed at 21:32 hrs. 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
Although this departure was 27 minutes behind the published schedule, the 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
timetable for the journey was such that it was possible to recover this time before 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
Bromsgrove. The locomotive travelled via the Sutton Park line before being 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
stopped for a few minutes at a red signal at Castle Bromwich curve. At 22:07 hrs, 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
after the signal cleared, the driver took the locomotive towards Bromsgrove via St 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
Andrews Junction and Kings Norton.

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
30 After passing Kings Norton, over a period of 11 minutes, the driver received three 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
text messages on his personal mobile phone. These were from the same family 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
member as the earlier phone call and all related to concerns about childcare 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
and the closure of schools. The driver sent four text message replies to these. At 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
22:38 hrs he received a picture message showing advice from the school relating 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
to school provision, and he sent a text reply. Table 1 and figure 6 show details 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
of these timings and the approximate locations at which the messages were 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
received.

31 The locomotive passed signal BA3611 at 22:39:51 hrs at 38 mph (61 km/h), and 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
was routed from the down Gloucester line to the up Gloucester and then onto the 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
up Bromsgrove loop through the station (figure 3). The train was only two minutes 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
behind schedule arriving in the station.

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
32 The driver slowed the locomotive for the approach to signal BA7623, at the south 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
end of the platforms in Bromsgrove station. This signal is approach controlled, 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
meaning that it was held at red for a fixed length of time as the train approached 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
it, before it cleared to a proceed aspect. This feature is intended to ensure that 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
the speed of approaching trains is reduced, because of a speed restriction on 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
the route beyond the signal. The signal is also fitted with the Train Protection and 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
Warning System (TPWS) which will automatically stop any train passing it at red. 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
At 22:42:01 hrs, when signal BA7623 cleared to a proceed aspect, with a route 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
set for the up Bromsgrove neck, the driver released the brake and applied a low 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
power demand.  The train passed the signal at 6 mph (10 km/h).

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
33 After passing the signal, the driver’s thoughts returned to the picture message 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
that he had received at 22:38 hrs (paragraph 30). At 22:42:43 hrs, while travelling 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
at 18 mph (29 km/h), he shut off the power, returning the controller to neutral. At 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
this point the locomotive was travelling at less than the maximum permitted speed 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
of 30 mph (48 km/h) for the first 350 metres towards the up Bromsgrove neck, 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
although this limit subsequently reduced to 15 mph (24 km/h) for the last 350 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
metres along the siding itself.

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
Events during the accident

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
34 The locomotive coasted for 52 seconds towards and into the up Bromsgrove 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
neck. The locomotive’s speed gradually increased on the 1 in 283 downhill 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
gradient from 18 mph (29 km/h) to 23 mph (37 km/h). 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
35 At 22:43:35 hrs, and with the locomotive 40 metres from the buffer stop, the driver 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
became aware of where he was and made an immediate, full application of the 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
locomotive’s brakes. Four seconds later, the locomotive collided with the buffer 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
stop at approximately 21 mph (34 km/h).

36 The locomotive tore the buffer stop off the end of the siding, pushing it for about 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
20 metres before coming to a stop. The locomotive ran off the end of the track, 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
ploughing into the ballast, with only the last two sets of wheels remaining on the 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
track. As it ran on, unguided by the track, the locomotive deviated to the left, 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
coming to a stop with its front left corner about 600 mm away from the nearest 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
running rail of the up Gloucester main line (figure 1). 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
37 The locomotive driver got out of the left side of the cab to investigate the 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
consequences of the collision. He soon became aware of the sound and lights 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
of an approaching passenger train, and realised that he was on an open running 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
line. He immediately ran towards the back of the locomotive to get clear of the 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
open line.

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
38 The passenger train, 1M87, was travelling at 85 mph (137 km/h) when it collided 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
with the corner of the locomotive at 22:44:26 hrs, approximately 47 seconds after 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
the locomotive had collided with the buffer stop.

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
Events following the accident

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
39 The driver of the passenger train immediately applied the emergency brake, 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
coming to a stop just south of Bromsgrove station. He reported the collision to the 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
signaller, who blocked all the lines to trains.

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
40 Network Rail reported the accident to RAIB at 23:21 hrs.

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
41 The few passengers on 1M87 were evacuated on foot to Bromsgrove station at 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
23:55 hrs. The train was moved to the station at 03:00 hrs on 24 March, ready for 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
recovery to Tyseley depot that afternoon.

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
42 The locomotive was rerailed by 16:00 hrs on 24 March, and left in the siding to 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
await recovery to Toton depot. 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
43 Network Rail undertook remedial work to remove parts of the buffer stop that 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
remained foul of the up Gloucester line. Work was also undertaken to clear up the 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
diesel spillage that occurred during recovery of the locomotive. The up and down 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
Gloucester lines were reopened to trains at 00:04 hrs on 25 March 2020.  The up 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
Bromsgrove neck remained out of use for several days until track repairs were

Analysis

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
Identification of the immediate cause 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
44 The locomotive became foul of the main line shortly before the passenger 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
service arrived.

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
45 When the locomotive hit the buffer stop, it continued for approximately 20 metres 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
and deviated to the left before coming to a stop. This caused it to foul the up 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
Gloucester line, which was open to traffic (paragraph 36). The passenger train 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
arrived less than a minute later, and collided with the corner of the locomotive 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
(paragraph 38).

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
Identification of causal factors 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
46 The accident occurred due to a combination of the following causal factors:

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
l The locomotive derailed to a position foul of the main line (paragraph 47).

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
l There was no opportunity to stop the passenger train before the collision 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
(paragraph 72).

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
Each of these factors is now considered in turn.

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
Derailment of the locomotive

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
47 The locomotive derailed to a position foul of the main line.

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
48 This causal factor arose due to a combination of the following:

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
l The driver was distracted from the driving task as the locomotive entered the 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
siding, resulting in the collision with the buffer stop (paragraph 49).

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
l The locomotive deviated to the left after collision with the buffer stop 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
(paragraph 58).

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
Each of these factors is now considered in turn.

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
Driver distraction

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
49 The driver was distracted from the driving task as the locomotive entered 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
the siding, resulting in the collision with the buffer stop.

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
50 When the driver started work on 23 March, he had just seen the Prime 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
Minister’s announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown (paragraph 27). He had 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
also had a telephone discussion with a family member about the impact of the 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
announcement on childcare arrangements (paragraph 28). These arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
had relied on support from other family members which would be prohibited 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
under lockdown.  It was clear to him that this would make it very difficult for him to 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
continue to manage his shift working pattern.

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
51 The driver stated that it was his normal routine to put his personal mobile phone 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
on silent and in his bag, prior to his driving turns, but on this occasion, he forgot 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
to do so and it remained, on silent and vibrate, in his pocket. As a result, he was 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
alerted to receipt of the messages from the family member and he read and 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
replied to them while driving (table 1). The final message he received included 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
advice from his childrens’ school that further complicated the childcare issue, and 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
the driver also replied to this. This final incoming message occurred about four 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
minutes before the locomotive passed the signal at Bromsgrove station and five 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
minutes before the collision with the buffer stop.

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
52 The driver’s use of his personal mobile phone was contrary to the DB Cargo 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
‘Mobile Phone Policy’, which states:

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
‘Personal mobile telephones must not be used whilst in the driving cab, or on or 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
about the running line’.

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
53 The driver was aware of his employer’s policy. However, the fact that the mobile 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
phone was vibrating in his pocket, combined with the significant, unresolved 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
childcare issue, drew him to read and respond to the mobile phone messages 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
while he was driving the locomotive. 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
54 When the locomotive passed the signal at Bromsgrove station, the driver applied 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
a little power to enter the siding, before removing it and coasting (paragraph 34). 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
At this point, his thoughts returned to the last message relating to the school, as 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
the childcare problem was still occupying his mind. He sent no further messages, 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
but continued to worry about how the childcare issue could be resolved, while the 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
locomotive coasted along the siding towards the buffer stop. The result of this was 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
that he was temporarily distracted from the driving task while in the siding. It was 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
only when the locomotive was about 40 metres away from the buffer stop that 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
the driver became aware of his location and immediately made a full application 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
of the locomotive’s brakes. However, it was too late to avoid a collision with the 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
buffer stop. 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
55 Although the driver had been awake for approximately 13 hours before starting 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
his shift, there is no evidence to suggest that he was particularly tired at the time 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
of the accident. His time awake would have affected his level of fatigue later in 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
the shift,2 and RAIB notes that this does not align with good practice in fatigue 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
management. However, RAIB does not consider that fatigue contributed to the 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
cause of the driver’s distraction on this occasion.

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
56 DB Cargo’s ‘Fatigue Management Policy’ places responsibility on the employee 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
for reporting fatigue issues, either before or during a shift. DB Cargo also stated 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
that non-fatigue related ‘fitness for duty’ issues, such as those involving personal 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
circumstances, use the same reporting method.  This policy states that:

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
‘All employees have a duty to report if they feel the onset of fatigue at the 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
commencement or at any point during their shift, to the Control Duty Manager.’

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
2 RAIB has examined first night shift fatigue in its investigation into an uncontrolled freight train run back at Shap 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
(RAIB report 15/2011). This also featured in a safety digest into a buffer stop collision at London King’s Cross 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
(Safety digest 15/2017).

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
57 At the time of signing on, which was done remotely by telephone and not 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
face- to- face, the driver did not consider that he was fatigued, nor did he consider 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
that this was an issue during the journey to Bromsgrove. He also did not consider 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
that the emerging childcare issues would affect his ability to drive during his shift. 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
As a result, he saw no need to report anything under the fatigue management 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
reporting system either before, or during, his shift.

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
Deviation of the locomotive to the left

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
58 The locomotive deviated to the left after collision with the buffer stop.

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
59 The locomotive hit the buffer stop at 21 mph (34 km/h), which was 40% above 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
the maximum permitted speed in the up Bromsgrove neck. The result was that 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
the locomotive detached the buffer stop from the end of the siding and pushed 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
its structure ahead of it. The locomotive ran off the end of the rails and ploughed 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
through the ground ahead of it, causing the ballast to pile up. This caused the 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
locomotive to slow to a stop. It would also have influenced the direction in which 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
the locomotive travelled, with this effect being largely random. In this accident, it 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
caused the locomotive to deviate towards the up Gloucester line. 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
60 The speed of the locomotive as it hit the buffer stop was sufficient for it to travel 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
far enough to become foul of the up Gloucester line before stopping. If the 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
locomotive had not exceeded the maximum permitted speed for the siding, it 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
would almost certainly not have travelled far enough to foul the main line.

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
Standards related to the buffer stop

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
61 When the buffer stop was installed in its current location around 2004, the 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
relevant standard for managing buffer stop risks was railway group standard GC/

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
RT5033 issue one (‘Terminal Tracks - Managing the Risk’). This states that:

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
‘A length of straight track, greater than the length of the longest vehicle 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
permitted to use the track, shall be provided wherever reasonably practicable at 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
the approach to the buffer stop, so that any vehicle striking the buffer stop will 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
do so with its longitudinal axis at right angles to the buffer beam.’

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
62 Although there was a very gradual curve to the main line and the parallel siding, 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
this was of such a large radius that the locomotive would have still struck the 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
buffer stop square on, in line with the intent of this requirement.

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
63 GC/RT5033 also defined circumstances in which an overrun risk assessment was 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
required to be carried out for a buffer stop. This stated:

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
The risks of harm to people and damage to critical structures arising from a train 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
overrun at the following locations shall be assessed:

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
l terminal or bay platforms 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
l terminal tracks on freight lines and sidings used by trains carrying dangerous 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
goods 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
l where there are significant identified risks to persons or property beyond the 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
railway boundary.

November 2020

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
64 Because the up Bromsgrove neck was not at a station platform, was not used 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
by trains carrying dangerous goods and posed no significant risk to those 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
outside the railway boundary, there was no requirement to undertake a specific 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
overrun risk assessment under this standard. However, there would have still 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
been a requirement for the buffer stop installation to have a more general risk 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
assessment as required by the general duties associated with the Health and 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
65 Network Rail was unable to locate any records from installation of the buffer stop 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
in its current location (paragraph 19) to indicate that an overrun risk assessment 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
was carried out, nor any findings of more general risk assessments. Bromsgrove 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
station was remodelled in 2016, but no changes were made to the buffer stop at 

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
that time.

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
66 However, a number of mitigations, of the types suggested in standards relating to 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
overrun risk assessment, were present at the up Bromsgrove neck. These were:

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
l Two permanently lit red lights were fitted to the buffer stop, to aid visibility by 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
any approaching trains.

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
l Imposition of a 15 mph (24 km/h) maximum permitted speed, to manage the 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
impact energy in any collision with the buffer stop.

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
l Normal stopping position for locomotives was more than 50 metres short of the 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
buffer stop, managing the risk of trains coming into contact with it.

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
l Use of an approach-controlled signal on entry to the siding, managing the speed 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
of trains entering it.

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
l The Train Protection and Warning system (TPWS) was fitted at this signal. This 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
would have the effect of stopping any trains that pass it at danger, well before 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
they reach the buffer stop.

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
67 The buffer stop was not subject to any specific maintenance regime, as 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
defined by Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/001 module 18 ‘Inspection and 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
Maintenance of Permanent Way – Buffer Stops’. Network Rail did not consider 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
the up Bromsgrove neck to be a ‘terminal track on a freight line’, and so a 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
specific buffer stop inspection regime was not required by the standard. However, 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
Network Rail did expect routine visual inspections of the track to identify any 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
significant defects with the buffer stop and to flag these for attention. There is no 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
evidence to suggest that there was any defect with the buffer stop at the time of 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
the collision.

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
68 The red lights on the buffer stop were subject to regular inspection by Network 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
Rail’s Distribution and Plant team. This included replacement of the lamps every 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
six months. Records show that this was being carried out. In addition, CCTV 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
from a passing train shows that the buffer stop lighting was illuminated four hours 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
before the accident (figure 7), indicating that it was almost certainly lit at the time 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
of the accident.

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
69 The current guidance on risk assessment for buffer stops is described in 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
GIGN5633 (paragraph 84). Although intended for platform tracks, the risk 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
assessment methodology can be applied to non-platform lines. It considers 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
features such as the layout of the terminal track, its collision history, physical 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
condition and any surrounding infrastructure and population. The output of the 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
assessment is an estimation of the fatality and injury risk, expressed as ‘estimated 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
years per fatality’.3 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
70 Although GIGN5633 does not define any action levels relating to this calculated 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
risk, its identically titled predecessor standard, GCRC5633, indicated a first action 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
level of approximately 3,300 years per equivalent fatality. 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
71 RAIB retrospectively applied the methodology of GIGN5633 to the up Bromsgrove 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
neck, taking into account the mitigations present and the possibility of a 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
passenger train on the adjacent up Gloucester line. This indicated a risk of one 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
fatality every 135,000 years, considerably less than the threshold for action 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
suggested by the earlier standard.

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
3 Note that the term ‘fatality’ includes statistically weighted injuries, in line with railway industry standard practice.

Operation of the passenger train

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
72 There was no opportunity to stop the passenger train before the collision.

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
73 The passenger train, 1M87, was running on clear signals at around 85 mph 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
(136 km/h) on the approach to Bromsgrove. There was no possibility that the 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
driver of the train could have stopped the train before the collision, even if he had 

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
applied the brakes on sighting the locomotive’s lights in the dark. Furthermore, 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
seeing the lights of a locomotive on the adjacent up Bromsgrove neck would not 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
have been a reason for the driver to brake, because locomotives regularly wait 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
in the siding. The driver had no idea that the locomotive was foul of his line until 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
his train collided with it. However, as his train approached, he became aware of 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
a cloud of dust that had been thrown into the air during the derailment, but he did 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
not have time to apply the brakes before the collision.

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
74 The passenger train driver did not receive any warning of the derailed locomotive 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
prior to reaching the collision site. Such a warning could have come from the 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
signaller, if they had been alerted to the derailment by a GSM-R4 call from the 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
locomotive driver. Alternatively, the locomotive driver could have sent a Railway 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
Emergency Group Call (REC), which sends a ‘stop all trains’ message to all 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
trains in the vicinity. However, the locomotive driver did not contact the signaller 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
immediately after the derailment, nor did he initiate a REC. 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
75 The passenger train arrived approximately 47 seconds after the locomotive 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
collided with the buffer stop (paragraph 38). The locomotive came to a stop about 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
four seconds after it hit the buffer stop. A cloud of ballast dust was thrown into 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
the air, affecting the driver’s visibility of the surroundings. The driver would then 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
have taken a few seconds to recognise what had happened, having only become 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
aware of the buffer stop four seconds before colliding with it (paragraph 35). 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
76 The locomotive driver’s first action after the collision with the buffer stop was to

get out of the locomotive to investigate whether it had derailed. He would have 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
found this difficult to judge from the cab due to the dust cloud. Exiting the cab on 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
a class 66 locomotive involves moving behind the driver’s seat and opening a 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
door into a short corridor. The external door then needs to be opened before the 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
driver can climb down to ground level. This would probably have taken the driver 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
about 20 seconds to complete. It is likely that the driver would only have reached 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
the track about 20 seconds before the arrival of the passenger train. Therefore, 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
he did not have time to give any warning to the signaller or to initiate a REC. The 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
driver only had time to run to the back of the locomotive to get clear of the up 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
Gloucester line onto which he had alighted, and on which the passenger train was 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
approaching.

77 Module M1 of the railway Rule Book (GERT8000-M1 ‘Dealing with a train 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
accident or train evacuation’) states that in the event of a train accident, the driver 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
should take the following actions:

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
l You must immediately switch on the hazard warning indication where 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
provided. 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
l If you cannot do this, you must display a red light forward. 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
l You must then check:

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
o if any other lines are obstructed (if in doubt, treat them as obstructed), and 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
decide the quickest way to stop any approaching trains 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
o the exact location of your train.

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
l You must tell the signaller about the accident in the quickest way possible and 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
whether the electric traction current needs to be switched off.

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
78 The driver was in a state of shock and confusion having just collided with 

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
the buffer stop. He has stated that he did not consider the possibility that the 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
locomotive was foul of the main line at this time. Therefore, he did not recognise 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
that he needed to switch the hazard lights on. Had he switched them on, the 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
approaching passenger train would not have seen them until a few seconds 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
before the collision. It is possible that this would have caused the passenger train 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
driver to apply the brakes. However, although this might have reduced the speed 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
of the train before the collision, it would not have prevented it.

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
79 For the same reasons, the locomotive driver did not turn on the red tail lamps in 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
the leading cab, nor show any other red light through the cab window. However, 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
had he done so, again, it would have been unlikely to have had any effect on the 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
actions of the passenger train driver because locomotives can often be seen to be 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
waiting in the up Bromsgrove neck.

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
80 The driver’s actions in checking what had happened to his locomotive before 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
contacting the signaller were consistent with the wording of the Rule Book. RSSB5 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
has since reported that an amendment to the Rule Book will come into force in 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
December 2020 which will require the driver to inform the signaller of an accident 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
before checking if any other lines are affected.

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
81 The ‘GSM-R Handbook’ (RSSB document RS523) describes the operation and 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
functions of the GSM-R radio system fitted in trains and available to signallers and 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
operations controllers. Section 5.3 describes the use of the REC in an emergency 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
situation. It states:

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
l A REC can be used during any emergency situation affecting more than one 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
line or more than one train. 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
l In an emergency situation the driver may need to initiate a REC.

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
November 2020

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
82 Although it associates possible use of the REC with emergency situations, the 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
handbook does not provide detailed guidance on what situations the REC should 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
be used for and those for which it should not. Because a REC sends a ‘STOP 

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
EMERGENCY’ message to all trains in the relevant area, there will be situations 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
where a REC is appropriate and others where stopping all trains is not necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
DB Cargo stated that its training in the use of the REC uses scenarios to test the 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
responses of drivers to emergency situations and the appropriate use of the REC. 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
However, it also stated that there is no definitive list of situations where REC 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
use is required and the decision is largely down to driver discretion based on the 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
circumstances at the time. The locomotive driver did not initially consider that his 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
locomotive could be affecting the adjacent line and so did not consider using a 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
REC.

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
Observation

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
Buffer stop risk assessment

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
83 The standards and processes that Network Rail applies to assess the risk of 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
overrun at buffer stops do not address those on non-platform tracks.

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
84 Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/2102 issue 8 (Design and construction of 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
track) requires the use of GC/RT5033 (paragraph 61) for the design of new or 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
renewed buffer stops. GC/RT5033 has since been superseded by rail industry 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
standard RIS-7016-INS ‘Interface between station platforms, track, trains and 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
buffer stops’. This includes the requirements for overrun risk assessment of buffer 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
stops. Associated guidance on how to undertake buffer stop risk assessments is 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
described in rail industry guidance note GIGN5633 ‘Recommendations for the risk 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
assessment of buffer stops and end impact walls’.

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
85 RIS-7016-INS states that its purpose is to set out ‘requirements for the design 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
and maintenance of station platforms for their safe interface with track, trains and 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
buffer stops’. Therefore, sidings that are not in station platforms, such as the up 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
Bromsgrove neck, are not covered by it. The associated guidance in GIGN5633 is 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
linked to RIS-7016-INS and so is also limited to platform tracks.

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
86 RAIB observes that although earlier standards had some applicability to non-

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
passenger terminal tracks, the current standards do not. Therefore, there is no 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
current requirement or guidance to specifically risk assess the overrun risk at 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
buffer stops that are not located in station platforms.

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
Previous occurrences of a similar character 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
87 RAIB has investigated a number of buffer stop collisions. Examples of these 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
are Sudbury (RAIB report 26/2006), Chester (RAIB report 26/2014) and King’s 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
Cross (RAIB report 15/2016). RAIB has also published a safety digest into a 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
second buffer stop collision at King’s Cross (Safety digest 15/2017). However, 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
the circumstances of this accident differ from those featured in previous 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
investigations, and as a result none of the previously made recommendations are 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
directly relevant here.

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
Summary of conclusions 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
Immediate cause 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
88 The locomotive became foul of the main line shortly before the passenger service 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
arrived (paragraph 44).

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
Causal factors 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
89 The causal factors were:

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
a The locomotive derailed to a position foul of the main line (paragraph 47).  

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
This causal factor arose due to a combination of the following:

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
i The driver was distracted from the driving task as the locomotive entered 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
the siding, resulting in the collision with the buffer stop (paragraph 49, 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
Learning point 1).

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
ii The locomotive deviated to the left after collision with the buffer stop 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
(paragraph 58, No Recommendation).

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
b There was no opportunity to stop the passenger train before the collision 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
(paragraph 72, Learning points 2 and 3).  

--- Document Chunk 786 ---

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
90 Although not linked to the accident on 23 March 2020, RAIB observes that:

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
a The standards and processes that Network Rail applies to assess the risk 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
of overrun at buffer stops do not address those on non-platform tracks 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---

Recommendation and learning points

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
Recommendation

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
91 The following recommendation is made:6

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
1 The intent of this recommendation is to improve the management of 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
overrun risk at buffer stops that are not located in station platforms. 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
 Network Rail should review, and revise if necessary, the processes and 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
standards that it applies to buffer stops installed on non-platform terminal 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
tracks, to ensure that the risks arising from potential buffer stop collisions 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
are being adequately managed (paragraph 90).

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
 This recommendation may also be applicable to other infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
operators.

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
Learning points

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
92 This accident demonstrates the importance of:7

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
1 train drivers complying with their employer’s mobile phone usage policy 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
so as to avoid unnecessary distractions while driving.

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
2 informing the signaller following a train accident, even before it is 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
confirmed that adjacent lines are obstructed.

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
3 train drivers, and other staff, intending to get out of their trains following 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
an incident ensuring that they do so in a manner that does not place 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
them at unnecessary risk from trains on lines that are open to traffic.

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
6 Those identified in the recommendation have a general and ongoing obligation to comply with health and safety 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
legislation, and need to take these recommendations into account in ensuring the safety of their employees and 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
others.  

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
Additionally, for the purposes of regulation 12(1) of the Railways (Accident Investigation and Reporting) Regulations 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
2005, this recommendation is addressed to the Office of Rail and Road to enable it to carry out its duties under 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
regulation 12(2) to: 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
(a) ensure that recommendations are duly considered and where appropriate acted upon; and 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
(b) report back to RAIB details of any implementation measures, or the reasons why no implementation 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
measures are being taken.

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
Copies of both the regulations and the accompanying guidance notes (paragraphs 200 to 203) can be found on 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
RAIB’s website www.gov.uk/raib.

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
7 ‘Learning points’ are intended to disseminate safety learning that is not covered by a recommendation. They are 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
included in a report when RAIB wishes to reinforce the importance of compliance with existing safety arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
(where RAIB has not identified management issues that justify a recommendation) and the consequences of failing 

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
to do so. They also record good practice and actions already taken by industry bodies that may have a wider 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
application.
