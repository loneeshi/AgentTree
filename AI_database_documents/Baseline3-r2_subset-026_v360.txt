1.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
1.3.1.1 Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are u sed in more than one 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions. 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
1.3.1.2 Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and ar e 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
rethinking their i nfrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
ATC systems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS). 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
1.4.1.1 The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as: 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
 Cross border interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
 Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic. 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
 Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
 Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving bl ock, enabling 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
exploitation of maximum track capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
 The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology. 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
 Enabling Pan -European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
components. Strengthe ning the position of the European railw ay industry on the 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
world market. 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
 Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
management. 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
1.5 About this Document 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
1.5.1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
(ETCS) from a technical point of view. 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
1.5.1.2 Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a transition period. They might be removed 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
in a future edition of the standard. 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
1.5.1.3 To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
and understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level. 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
1.5.1.4 For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability i s outside 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
the scope of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
1.6.1.1 The SRS cover s 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
introduction. 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
1.6.1.2 All readers may need to refer to the Glossary  of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET -

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
023). 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
1.7 Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
1.7.1.1 This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the techn ical 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
interoperability. This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
identified as containing ERTMS/ETCS on -board and/or ERTMS/ETCS trackside 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
requirements (see details in chapter 9). 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
1.7.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated requirements, 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
with the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control -Command and 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
Signalling TSI and in this SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
1.7.1.3 For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs. 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
In any case, the requirements of this SRS , which are allocated to the trackside and  

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
related to the implemented functions, shall be respected. 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
1.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
1.7.1.5 Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
generate any interoperability problems. 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
1.8 Contents of the SRS 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
1.8.1.1 The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
(ETCS) of ERTMS. 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
1.8.1.2 This sub-section is intended to give a rough over view of the contents of each chapter 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
the relevant chapters.

1.8.2 Chapter 1: Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
1.8.2.1 Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
the SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter. 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
1.8.3 Chapter 2: Basic System Description 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
1.8.3.1 Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure. 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
1.8.3.2 Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels. 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
1.8.3.3 Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
1.8.4 Chapter 3: Principles 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
1.8.4.1 Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
onboard and trackside subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
1.8.4.2 The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms. 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
1.8.5 Chapter 4: Modes and Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
transitions between modes. 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
1.8.6 Chapter 5: Procedures 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
1.8.6.1 Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
interoperability. Pro cedures are presented by a state transition chart and a 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
onboard unit and the conditions tha t must be fulfilled to switch from one state to 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
another. 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
1.8.7 Chapter 6: Management of older System Versions 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and list s the 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in  the other 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used  by the 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
trackside subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
1.8.8 Chapter 7: ERTMS/ETCS Language 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
1.8.8.1 Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
over the air gap between track a nd train. The grouping of these into packets is 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

sequence for radio) necessary to achieve technical interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
1.8.9.2 The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protoc ol and the content of

messages. 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
1.8.10 Chapter 9: Classification of the SRS clauses 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
1.8.10.1 Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
to 8 of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
1.8.10.2 In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
equipment with the SRS, it identifies which clauses contain requirements allocated to 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
because th ey contain requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
because they are of another type.

2.4 System structure 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
2.4.1.1 Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system will have to be 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.  

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
2.4.1.2 This defines two subsystems, the on-board subsystem and the trackside subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
2.4.1.3 The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
a) the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification; 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification; 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3), 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
interoperability requirement will be established.

2.5 Subsystems 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
2.5.1 Trackside subsystem 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
2.5.1.1 Depending of the application level (see further sections), the trackside subsystem can 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
a) balise 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
b) lineside electronic unit 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
c) the radio communication network (GSM-R) 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC) 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
e) Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
f) Radio infill unit 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
g) Key Management Centre (KMC) 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
h) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
2.5.1.2 Balise 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
2.5.1.2.1 The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
2.5.1.2.2 The balise is based on the existing Euroba lise specifications. These documents are 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications. 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
2.5.1.2.3 The balises provides the up -link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
to the on-board subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
2.5.1.2.4 The balises can provide fixed messages or, w hen connected to a lineside electronic 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
unit, messages that can be changed.  

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
2.5.1.2.5 The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
2.5.1.3 Lineside electronic unit 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
2.5.1.3.1 The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems. 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
2.5.1.4 Trackside radio communication network (GSM-R) 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
2.5.1.4.1 The GSM -R radio communication network  is used for the bi -directional exchange of 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
messages between on-board subsystems and RBC or radio infill units.

Basic System Description 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
Page 9/25 

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
2.5.1.5.1 The RBC is a computer-based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
on basis of information received from external trackside systems and on basis of 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
information exchanged with the on-board subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
2.5.1.5.2 The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the re sponsibility of 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
2.5.1.5.3 The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
between the RBC and the on-board subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
2.5.1.6 Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
2.5.1.6.1 The Euroloop subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction. 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
2.5.1.6.2 The Euroloop subsystem is composed of an on -board functionality and by one or more 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
trackside parts.  

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
2.5.1.7 Radio infill Unit 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
2.5.1.7.1 The RADIO INFILL subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signa lling 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
information in advance as regard to the next main signal in the train running direction. 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
2.5.1.7.2 The RADIO INFILL subsystem is composed of an on -board functionality and by one or 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
more trackside parts (named RADIO INFILL Unit).  

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
2.5.1.8 KMC 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
2.5.1.8.1 The role of the KMC is to manage the cryptographic keys, which are used to secure 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
the EURORADIO communications between the ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
on-board equipments, RBCs and RIUs). 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
2.5.1.9 PKI 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
2.5.1.9.1 The role of the PKI is to manage and distribute digital certificates, so as to allow a  

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
secure on-line distribution of cryptographic keys between KMCs and from a KMC to the 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
ERTMS/ETCS entities (ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipments, RBCs and RIUs). 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
2.5.2 On-board subsystem 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
2.5.2.1 Depending of the application level (see further sections), the on -board subsystem can 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
a) the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
b) the on-board part of the GSM-R radio system; 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---

2.6 Levels and transitions 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
2.6.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
2.6.1.1 The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way  to express the 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on -

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and i n the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
equipment respectively.  

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
2.6.1.2 Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to t he required performance. 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
2.6.1.3 For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
used for operation on non -equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines  equipped with train 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
control system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.  

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
2.6.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
2.6.2.1 A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment always co -operates with the 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.  

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
2.6.2.2 All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules.  

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
2.6.2.3 ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:  

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (tra in equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not 

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
equipped with any train control system  (ERTMS/ETCS or national system ) or on a 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
their supervision is currently not possible) 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Level NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
equipped with a national system) 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optio nally 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
Euroloop or Radio infill) 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
Euroradio) with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 (similar to level 2 but with train position and train 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
integrity supervision based on information received from the train)

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported.

2.6.3 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 0 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
2.6.3.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
2.6.3.1.1 Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
national systems or on lines where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure  and/or 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
possible (e.g. commissioning or on-board/trackside failed components).  

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
2.6.3.1.2 In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains without any train control system and 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
movement authorities to the driver.  

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
2.6.3.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.  

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
2.6.3.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
2.6.3.1.5 Level 0 uses no track -train transmission except Euroba lises to announce/command 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
level transitions. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. No balise data except 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
certain special commands are interpreted. 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
2.6.3.1.6 No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
has to be entere d in order not to have to stop a train at a level transition to 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
2.6.4.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
2.6.4.1.1 Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
national train control and speed supervision systems.  

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
2.6.4.1.2 Train control information generated trackside by the national train contr ol system is 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
system.  

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
2.6.4.1.3 Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
performance and functionality of the underlying systems.  

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
2.6.4.1.4 Intentionally deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
2.6.4.1.5 The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
national systems.  

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
2.6.4.1.6 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
ERTMS/ETCS.  

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
2.6.4.1.7 Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track -train information except to 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
2.6.4.1.8 The information displayed to the driver depends on the functionality of the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
national system. T he active national system is indicated to the driver as part of that 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed. 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
2.6.4.1.9 A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level. 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
2.6.4.1.10 Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
in order to perform the transitions from/to the nationa l system and/or in order to give 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
 Level NTC uses the track -train transmission system from an underlying national 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---

2.6.5 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
2.6.5.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
2.6.5.1.1 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
an overlay on an underlying signalling system. 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
2.6.5.1.2 Movement auth orities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via  

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
Eurobalises.  

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
2.6.5.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
protects against overrun of the authority.  

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
2.6.5.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision ar e performed by the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
2.6.5.1.5 Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices.   

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
2.6.5.1.6 The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information. 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
2.6.5.1.7 If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
to observe the lineside signal to know when t o proceed. The train has then to be 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
speed.  

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
2.6.5.1.8 Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.  

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
2.6.5.1.9 Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi -continuous 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
infill is provided. 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
2.6.5.1.10 Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infill. In this case, the 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
available and even at standstill.  

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
2.6.5.1.11 Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
operation without release speed.

3.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 1716 ---
3.3.1 Scope and purpose 

--- Document Chunk 1717 ---
3.3.1.1 The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These 

--- Document Chunk 1718 ---
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 1719 ---
3.3.1.2 The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general 

--- Document Chunk 1720 ---
and functional terms. 

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
3.3.1.3 The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
number. 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
3.3.1.4 Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
3.4 Balise configuration and linking 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
3.4.1 Balise Configurations – Balise Group Definition 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
3.4.1.1 A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises. 

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
3.4.1.2 In every balise shall at least be stored: 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
b) The number of balises inside the group 

--- Document Chunk 1732 ---
c) The balise group identity. 

--- Document Chunk 1733 ---
3.4.1.3 The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the 

--- Document Chunk 1734 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1735 ---
3.4.2 Balise Co-ordinate System 

--- Document Chunk 1736 ---
3.4.2.1.1 Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system. 

--- Document Chunk 1737 ---
3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co -ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse 

--- Document Chunk 1738 ---
direction) is identified as balise group orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 1739 ---
3.4.2.2 Balise groups composed of two or more balises 

--- Document Chunk 1740 ---
3.4.2.2.1 The origin  of the co -ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise 

--- Document Chunk 1741 ---
number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1742 ---
3.4.2.2.2 The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise 

--- Document Chunk 1743 ---
numbers.

3.4.3 Balise Information Types and Usage 

--- Document Chunk 1943 ---
3.4.3.1 In level 1, a ll information to the on -board system is given from balise groups or 

--- Document Chunk 1944 ---
additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units  (see section 3.9). In level 2/3, 

--- Document Chunk 1945 ---
balise groups are mostly used for location information. 

--- Document Chunk 1946 ---
3.4.3.2 A balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either  for nominal or for reverse 

--- Document Chunk 1947 ---
direction, or may contain information valid for both directions . In level 1, t his 

--- Document Chunk 1948 ---
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5): 

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
a) Non-infill 

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
b) Intentionally deleted 

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---
c) Infill. 

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
3.4.3.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
3.4.3.2.2 Note: Infill information is referring to the location reference of an announced balise 

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
3.4.3.3 Some information shall be read  also in sleeping mode and when no linking information 

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is 

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of 

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
at least two balises shall be used. 

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
3.4.4 Linking 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
3.4.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
3.4.4.1.1 Aim of linking:  

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
 To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the 

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action.  

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
 To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise. 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
 To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4). 

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
3.4.4.1.2 A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
advance. 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
3.4.4.1.2.1 Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
linked also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains 

--- Document Chunk 1970 ---
repositioning information marked accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 1971 ---
3.4.4.2 Content of linking information 

--- Document Chunk 1972 ---
3.4.4.2.1 Linking information shall be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 1973 ---
a) The identity of the linked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1974 ---
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

--- Document Chunk 1985 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1986 ---
c) The accuracy of this location. 

--- Document Chunk 1987 ---
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define 

--- Document Chunk 1988 ---
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises. 

--- Document Chunk 1989 ---
d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or 

--- Document Chunk 1990 ---
reverse). 

--- Document Chunk 1991 ---
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occ urs with the expected balise 

--- Document Chunk 1992 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1993 ---
3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are 

--- Document Chunk 1994 ---
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation 

--- Document Chunk 1995 ---
window of the furthest announced balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1996 ---
3.4.4.2.2 Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following 

--- Document Chunk 1997 ---
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information 

--- Document Chunk 1998 ---
3.4.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 1999 ---
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2. 

--- Document Chunk 2000 ---
3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known 

--- Document Chunk 2001 ---
because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise 

--- Document Chunk 2002 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 2003 ---
3.4.4.2.3 For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to 

--- Document Chunk 2004 ---
be used in case of data inconsistencies: 

--- Document Chunk 2005 ---
a) Train trip  (Trip mode, see Chapter 4) 

--- Document Chunk 2006 ---
b) Command service brake  

--- Document Chunk 2007 ---
c) No reaction 

--- Document Chunk 2008 ---
For further details see section 3.16.2. 

--- Document Chunk 2009 ---
3.4.4.3 Unlinked Balise Groups 

--- Document Chunk 2010 ---
3.4.4.3.1 A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the 

--- Document Chunk 2011 ---
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.  

--- Document Chunk 2012 ---
3.4.4.3.2 Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.   

--- Document Chunk 2013 ---
3.4.4.3.3 Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier. 

--- Document Chunk 2014 ---
3.4.4.4 Rules related to linking 

--- Document Chunk 2015 ---
3.4.4.4.1 When no linking information is used on -board, all balise groups shall be taken into 

--- Document Chunk 2016 ---
account. 

--- Document Chunk 2017 ---
3.4.4.4.2 When linking information is used on -board, only balise groups marked as linked and 

--- Document Chunk 2018 ---
included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken 

--- Document Chunk 2019 ---

--- Document Chunk 2034 ---
a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by 

--- Document Chunk 2035 ---
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single 

--- Document Chunk 2036 ---
balise groups), AND 

--- Document Chunk 2037 ---
b) the balise gr oup contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, 

--- Document Chunk 2038 ---
AND 

--- Document Chunk 2039 ---
c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information. 

--- Document Chunk 2040 ---
3.4.4.4.3 The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in 

--- Document Chunk 2041 ---
the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from  

--- Document Chunk 2042 ---
 when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of

the balise group

--- Document Chunk 2047 ---
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account. 

--- Document Chunk 2048 ---
3.4.4.4.3.1 Note: The first possible location and the last possible location of the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 2049 ---
are defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy. 

--- Document Chunk 2050 ---
3.4.4.4.3.2 Note: The  interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the 

--- Document Chunk 2051 ---
expectation window. 

--- Document Chunk 2052 ---
3.4.4.4.4 In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location 

--- Document Chunk 2053 ---
shall start from the previously linked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2054 ---
3.4.4.4.5 The on-board equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise 

--- Document Chunk 2055 ---
only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking 

--- Document Chunk 2056 ---
information. 

--- Document Chunk 2057 ---
3.4.4.4.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall 

--- Document Chunk 2058 ---
expect the next one announced in the linking information (if any) when: 

--- Document Chunk 2059 ---
a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window 

--- Document Chunk 2060 ---
b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1 

--- Document Chunk 2061 ---
3.4.4.4.6.1 Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see 

--- Document Chunk 2062 ---
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking 

--- Document Chunk 2063 ---

--- Document Chunk 2460 ---
3.5.7.2.1 Note: The purpose of the “connection status” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for 

--- Document Chunk 2461 ---
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection. 

--- Document Chunk 2462 ---
3.5.7.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as 

--- Document Chunk 2463 ---

3.6 Location Principles, Train Position and Train Orientation 

--- Document Chunk 2537 ---
3.6.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 2538 ---
3.6.1.1 Two types of location based data are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 2539 ---
a) Data that refers only to a given location, referred to as Location data (e.g. level 

--- Document Chunk 2540 ---
transition orders, linking)

b) Data that remains valid for a certain distance, referred to as Profile data (e.g. SSP, 

--- Document Chunk 2553 ---
gradient).  

--- Document Chunk 2554 ---
3.6.1.2 Note: Determination of the Train Position  is always longitudinal along the route, even 

--- Document Chunk 2555 ---
though the route might be set through a complex track layout.

3.6.1.3 The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation to a 

--- Document Chunk 2566 ---
balise group, which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes: 

--- Document Chunk 2567 ---
 The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated distance between 

--- Document Chunk 2568 ---
the LRBG and the front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 2569 ---
 The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4) 

--- Document Chunk 2570 ---
 Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation 

--- Document Chunk 2571 ---
(see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding: 

--- Document Chunk 2572 ---
 the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG) 

--- Document Chunk 2573 ---
 the train orientation  

--- Document Chunk 2574 ---
 the train running direction 

--- Document Chunk 2575 ---
In case of an LRBG being a single balise group with no co -ordinate system 

--- Document Chunk 2576 ---
assigned, directional information is defined in reference to the pair of LRBG and 

--- Document Chunk 2577 ---
“previous LRBG”, see 3.4.2.3.3 

--- Document Chunk 2578 ---
 A list of LRBGs, which may alternatively be used b y trackside for referencing 

--- Document Chunk 2579 ---
location dependent information (see 3.6.2.2.2 c)). 

--- Document Chunk 2580 ---
3.6.1.4 Balise groups, which are marked as unlinked, shall never be used as LRBG.

3.6.1.4.1 Justification: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may 

--- Document Chunk 2593 ---
not be known to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 2594 ---
3.6.1.5 If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e . the side of the 

--- Document Chunk 2595 ---
active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train 

--- Document Chunk 2596 ---
orientation shall be as when a cab was last active. 

--- Document Chunk 2597 ---
3.6.1.6 The “train orientation relative to LRBG” is defined as the train orientation related to the 

--- Document Chunk 2598 ---
orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either “nominal” or “reverse”. 

--- Document Chunk 2599 ---

--- Document Chunk 2601 ---
3.6.2.1 Data Transmitted by Balises 

--- Document Chunk 2602 ---
3.6.2.1.1 All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer to the location reference 

--- Document Chunk 2603 ---
and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs. 

--- Document Chunk 2604 ---
3.6.2.1.2 Exception: Regarding infill information the section 3.6.2.3.1 shall apply. 

--- Document Chunk 2605 ---
3.6.2.2 Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC 

--- Document Chunk 2606 ---
3.6.2.2.1 All location and profile data transmitted from the RBC shall refer to the location 

--- Document Chunk 2607 ---
reference and orientation of the LRBG given in the same message. 

--- Document Chunk 2608 ---
3.6.2.2.2 For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met: 

--- Document Chunk 2609 ---
a) The on -board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference 

--- Document Chunk 2610 ---
when reporting its position to the RBC (in the following termed as LRBGONB). Only  

--- Document Chunk 2611 ---
 balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking 

--- Document Chunk 2612 ---
information, if linking information is used on-board 

--- Document Chunk 2613 ---
 or  

--- Document Chunk 2614 ---
 the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this 

--- Document Chunk 2615 ---
balise group was passed 

--- Document Chunk 2616 ---
shall be regarded. 

--- Document Chunk 2617 ---
b) The RBC shall use a balise group which was reported by the on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 2618 ---
as a reference (in the following termed as LRBG RBC). At a certain moment LRBG RBC 

--- Document Chunk 2619 ---
and LRBGONB can be different. 

--- Document Chunk 2620 ---
c) The on-board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at 

--- Document Chunk 2621 ---
least eight LRBGONB last reported to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 2622 ---
3.6.2.2.2.1 Exception to a) : When on -board position is unknown or when position data has 

--- Document Chunk 2623 ---
been deleted during SoM procedure , the on -board equipment shall use an LRBG 

--- Document Chunk 2624 ---
identifier set to "unknown" until the onboard has  validated its position again by passing 

--- Document Chunk 2625 ---
a balise group.

3.6.2.2.2.2 Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position 

--- Document Chunk 2638 ---
(as per 3.6.2.2.2.1)  or during SoM procedure an invalid position which it is not able to 

--- Document Chunk 2639 ---
confirm, the RBC shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a 

--- Document Chunk 2640 ---
position report from the onboard having validated its position by passing a balise 

--- Document Chunk 2641 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 2642 ---
3.6.2.2.2.3 Regarding c):  From the time it has reported an unknown position, or an  invalid 

--- Document Chunk 2643 ---
position during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message 

--- Document Chunk 2644 ---
with an LRBG not set to “unknown”, the on -board equipment shall also be able to

3.6.3.2.4 According to Figure 12 the structure  for non -continuous profile data shall allow to 

--- Document Chunk 2841 ---
contain multiple elements (value(n) for length(n)) inside the profile.  

--- Document Chunk 2842 ---
a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as 

--- Document Chunk 2843 ---
unsigned incremental values , each increment representin g the distance between  

--- Document Chunk 2844 ---
starts of element (n) and element (n-1). 

--- Document Chunk 2845 ---
b) For distance (1) the previously received data (or initial data/default values, see

--- Document Chunk 2912 ---

3.6.4.3 When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8) 

--- Document Chunk 2914 ---
location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received  balise 

--- Document Chunk 2915 ---
group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be relocated by 

--- Document Chunk 2916 ---
subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the 

--- Document Chunk 2917 ---
location related information: 

--- Document Chunk 2918 ---
a) the distance between the reference balise  group of the location related information

--- Document Chunk 3256 ---
3.6.6.4 Geographical position information shall always use a balise group as geographical 

--- Document Chunk 3257 ---
position reference balise group and if needed an offset from that balise group . A 

--- Document Chunk 3258 ---
geographical position reference balise group shall be either: 

--- Document Chunk 3259 ---
a) part of the last reported balise groups memorised on -board, in case the information 

--- Document Chunk 3260 ---

--- Document Chunk 3275 ---
account when calculating the geographical position.  

--- Document Chunk 3276 ---
3.6.6.6 In cases where the track kilometre is not incremental (jumps, changes in cou nting 

--- Document Chunk 3277 ---
direction, scaling error) the reported position might be wrong between the point of 

--- Document Chunk 3278 ---
irregularity and the next new reference.   

--- Document Chunk 3279 ---
3.6.6.7 In cases where single balise groups are used as a reference for geographical position 

--- Document Chunk 3280 ---
information and where no linking info rmation is available (and therefore no orientation 

--- Document Chunk 3281 ---
can be assigned to the balise  group), the on -board equipment shall ignore the

3.8 Movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 3493 ---
3.8.1 Characteristics of a MA  

--- Document Chunk 3494 ---
3.8.1.1 The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: 

--- Document Chunk 3495 ---
Structure of an MA): 

--- Document Chunk 3496 ---
a) The End of Movement Authority is the location to which the train is authorised to 

--- Document Chunk 3497 ---
move. 

--- Document Chunk 3498 ---
b) When t he Target Speed at the End of Movement Authority is zero, the End of 

--- Document Chunk 3499 ---
Movement Authority is called EOA (End of Authority) ; when the target speed is not 

--- Document Chunk 3500 ---
zero, it is called the LOA (Limit of Authority). This non zero target speed can be time 

--- Document Chunk 3501 ---
limited. 

--- Document Chunk 3502 ---
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement 

--- Document Chunk 3503 ---
Authority that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a 

--- Document Chunk 3504 ---
hazardous situation.  

--- Document Chunk 3505 ---
d) The e nd of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location 

--- Document Chunk 3506 ---
beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a 

--- Document Chunk 3507 ---
risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined 

--- Document Chunk 3508 ---
time. 

--- Document Chunk 3509 ---
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity 

--- Document Chunk 3510 ---
of the End of Movement Authority, when the target speed is zero. One release 

--- Document Chunk 3511 ---
speed can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. 

--- Document Chunk 3512 ---
Release speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4). 

--- Document Chunk 3513 ---
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section. 

--- Document Chunk 3514 ---
 A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used f or 

--- Document Chunk 3515 ---
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is 

--- Document Chunk 3516 ---
called the Section time-out.  

--- Document Chunk 3517 ---
 In addition, a second time -out value can be attached to the End Section of the 

--- Document Chunk 3518 ---
MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocatio n of the last section when it 

--- Document Chunk 3519 ---
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out. 

--- Document Chunk 3520 ---
3.8.1.2 The values of the time -outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time 

--- Document Chunk 3521 ---
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message. 

--- Document Chunk 3522 ---
3.8.1.3 Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list): 

--- Document Chunk 3523 ---
 the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to 

--- Document Chunk 3524 ---
fixed block principles) 

--- Document Chunk 3525 ---
 the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to 

--- Document Chunk 3526 ---
moving block principles)

 the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current 

--- Document Chunk 3539 ---
direction of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of 

--- Document Chunk 3540 ---
operation) 

--- Document Chunk 3541 ---
3.8.1.4 Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger  point), that is put 

--- Document Chunk 3542 ---
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver 

--- Document Chunk 3543 ---
should misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can 

--- Document Chunk 3544 ---
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 3545 ---
3.8.1.5 Note: Time -out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations 

--- Document Chunk 3546 ---
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on -board will only reflect the 

--- Document Chunk 3547 ---
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive: 

--- Document Chunk 3548 ---
a) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests 

--- Document Chunk 3549 ---
a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train. 

--- Document Chunk 3550 ---
b) End Section time -out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 

--- Document Chunk 3551 ---
automatic route rele ase can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a 

--- Document Chunk 3552 ---
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved. 

--- Document Chunk 3553 ---
c) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 

--- Document Chunk 3554 ---
overlap associated with the route remains valid for  a certain time to make sure that 

--- Document Chunk 3555 ---
the train has successfully stopped before its End of Movement A uthority. If the 

--- Document Chunk 3556 ---
overlap is still unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the 

--- Document Chunk 3557 ---
overlap. 

--- Document Chunk 3558 ---
3.8.1.6 Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance 

--- Document Chunk 3559 ---
to the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero , a target speed 

--- Document Chunk 3560 ---
higher than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the 

--- Document Chunk 3561 ---
trackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the 

--- Document Chunk 3562 ---
train from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the 

--- Document Chunk 3563 ---
responsibility of the on -board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is 

--- Document Chunk 3564 ---
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.  

--- Document Chunk 3565 ---
3.8.2 MA request to the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 3566 ---
3.8.2.1 It shall be possible for the on -board equipment to request a new M ovement Authority 

--- Document Chunk 3567 ---
from the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 3568 ---
3.8.2.2 The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.

3.8.2.3 In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available: 

--- Document Chunk 3570 ---
a) A def ined time before the train reaches the perturbation location assuming it is 

--- Document Chunk 3571 ---
running at the warning speed (see section 3.13.11 for details). 

--- Document Chunk 3572 ---
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap 

--- Document Chunk 3573 ---
timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires.

according to a fixed value (see appendix). 

--- Document Chunk 3594 ---
3.8.2.7 In level 2/3: an MA request shall be sent to the RBC when the driver selects start.

3.8.3.7 In case a main signal is at danger in level 1, the first section shall give the distance

distance to EOA is  given. Where available, information concerning danger point and 

--- Document Chunk 3678 ---
overlap for this EOA may also be given.  

--- Document Chunk 3679 ---
3.8.3.7.1 Justification: The balise group is not necessarily placed at the same location as the 

--- Document Chunk 3680 ---
signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same infor mation as the balise 

--- Document Chunk 3681 ---
group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to

therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what 

--- Document Chunk 3750 ---
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption

--- Document Chunk 3754 ---
with an End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, 

--- Document Chunk 3755 ---
the on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time -out value 

--- Document Chunk 3756 ---
with the value received with the new MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3757 ---
3.8.4.1.4.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of 

--- Document Chunk 3758 ---
current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the End Section timer. 

--- Document Chunk 3759 ---
3.8.4.2 Section Time-Outs 

--- Document Chunk 3760 ---
3.8.4.2.1 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section: 

--- Document Chunk 3761 ---
a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3762 ---
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 3763 ---
group giving the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3764 ---
3.8.4.2.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is always started before or at the 

--- Document Chunk 3765 ---
same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is 

--- Document Chunk 3766 ---
independent of in which balise the variable information is given.  

--- Document Chunk 3767 ---
3.8.4.2.2 When a Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 3768 ---
trackside, the following shall apply: 

--- Document Chunk 3769 ---
a) the EOA/LOA and the SvL shall be withdrawn to the entry point of the revoked 

--- Document Chunk 3770 ---
section. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information 

--- Document Chunk 3771 ---
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly; 

--- Document Chunk 3772 ---
b) the National/ Default Value of the Release Speed shall apply ; 

--- Document Chunk 3773 ---
c) if any, a non zero target speed value at the End of Movement Authority shall be set 

--- Document Chunk 3774 ---
to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA withdrawn 

--- Document Chunk 3775 ---
to the entry point of the revoked section). 

--- Document Chunk 3776 ---
3.8.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 3777 ---
3.8.4.2.3 The Section timer shall be stopped when the min safe front end of the train has passed 

--- Document Chunk 3778 ---
the associated Section timer stop location. 

--- Document Chunk 3779 ---
3.8.4.3 Time-out of the speed associated with the End of Movement Authority  (LOA 

--- Document Chunk 3780 ---
speed time out) 

--- Document Chunk 3781 ---
3.8.4.3.1 The on-board shall start a timer for the LOA speed:

a) For Level 2: at the value of the time stamp of the message including the MA.

3.8.4.3.1.1 Justification for b): This is to ensure that the timer is alwa ys started before or at the

same time as the related variable information is received. Thus the timer start is 

--- Document Chunk 3798 ---
independent of in which balise the variable information is given. 

--- Document Chunk 3799 ---
3.8.4.3.2 When the LOA speed timer value becomes greater than the time-out value given by  

--- Document Chunk 3800 ---
trackside, the speed associated with the LOA shall be set to zero (i.e. the Limit of 

--- Document Chunk 3801 ---
Authority becomes an End of Authority  and the SvL  is defined on-board according to 

--- Document Chunk 3802 ---
3.8.4.5). Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information  

--- Document Chunk 3803 ---
stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 3804 ---
3.8.4.4 Time-out of Overlap 

--- Document Chunk 3805 ---
3.8.4.4.1 The Overlap timer shall be started on -board when the train passes the Overlap timer 

--- Document Chunk 3806 ---
start location given by trackside with its max safe front end.  The timer shall be 

--- Document Chunk 3807 ---
considered as started even if a time-out value “infinite” is given. 

--- Document Chunk 3808 ---
3.8.4.4.2 When the Overlap timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 3809 ---
trackside, the following shall apply: 

--- Document Chunk 3810 ---
a) the overlap information shall be deleted and the Supervised Location shall be  

--- Document Chunk 3811 ---
determined in accordance with 3.8.4. 5. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive 

--- Document Chunk 3812 ---
list of location based information stored on -board, which shall be deleted 

--- Document Chunk 3813 ---
accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 3814 ---
b) the release speed associated with the Overlap shall be deleted 

--- Document Chunk 3815 ---
c) if any, a non zero target speed v alue at the End of Movement Authority shall be set 

--- Document Chunk 3816 ---
to zero (i.e. an LOA at the End of Movement Authority becomes an EOA). 

--- Document Chunk 3817 ---
3.8.4.4.3 If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 3818 ---
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time -out value and 

--- Document Chunk 3819 ---
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2. 

--- Document Chunk 3820 ---
3.8.4.4.4 In case no Overlap timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 

--- Document Chunk 3821 ---
Overlap timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 3822 ---
shall consider that the Overlap timer value became greater than its time-out value and 

--- Document Chunk 3823 ---
shall apply 3.8.4.4.2. 

--- Document Chunk 3824 ---
3.8.4.4.4.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, 

--- Document Chunk 3825 ---
therefore it is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what 

--- Document Chunk 3826 ---
share of the time-out value has elapsed since the crossing event. The safe assumption 

--- Document Chunk 3827 ---
is to consider that the time -out value has been exceeded a nd therefore that the 

--- Document Chunk 3828 ---
Overlap will soon be released by the Interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 3829 ---

--- Document Chunk 3843 ---

3.8.4.4.5.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of

current MA was lost) without unintentionally affecting the Overlap timer. 

--- Document Chunk 3846 ---
3.8.4.5 Supervised Location 

--- Document Chunk 3847 ---
3.8.4.5.1 The Supervised Location (SvL) shall be defined on-board as: 

--- Document Chunk 3848 ---
a) the end of overlap (if any and before time-out). 

--- Document Chunk 3849 ---
b) if not, the Danger Point (if any). 

--- Document Chunk 3850 ---
c) if not, the End Of Authority. 

--- Document Chunk 3851 ---
3.8.4.5.2 As long as a Limit of Authority is supervised, no SvL shall be defined on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 3852 ---
3.8.4.6 Infill MA (level 1 only) 

--- Document Chunk 3853 ---
3.8.4.6.1 An MA given by an infill device is called an infill MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3854 ---
3.8.4.6.2 An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the on -board equipment is in FS or LS 

--- Document Chunk 3855 ---
mode. 

--- Document Chunk 3856 ---
3.8.4.6.3 The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main 

--- Document Chunk 3857 ---
signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is tra nsmitted in 

--- Document Chunk 3858 ---
advance by the infill device. 

--- Document Chunk 3859 ---
3.8.4.6.4 An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the linking information, regarding the 

--- Document Chunk 3860 ---
main signal balise group to which it refers, is available. 

--- Document Chunk 3861 ---
3.8.4.6.5 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal: 

--- Document Chunk 3862 ---
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the 

--- Document Chunk 3863 ---
first encountered balise of the infill balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 3864 ---
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop 

--- Document Chunk 3865 ---
message. 

--- Document Chunk 3866 ---
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time 

--- Document Chunk 3867 ---
stamp of the radio infill message including the MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3868 ---
3.8.5 MA Update 

--- Document Chunk 3869 ---
3.8.5.1 A new MA shall replace a previously received MA in the following ways: 

--- Document Chunk 3870 ---
a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill 

--- Document Chunk 3871 ---
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced 

--- Document Chunk 3872 ---
by the new data.  

--- Document Chunk 3873 ---
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced balise 

--- Document Chunk 3874 ---
group at the next main signal shall be replaced.

the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6). 

--- Document Chunk 3888 ---
3.8.5.1.2 When an infill MA is r eceived, the on -board shall start a new MA section at the infill

location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1). 

--- Document Chunk 3890 ---
3.8.5.1.3 If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former 

--- Document Chunk 3891 ---
MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to 

--- Document Chunk 3892 ---
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 

--- Document Chunk 3893 ---
which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 3894 ---
3.8.5.1.4 If a new MA defines an SvL while the on -board was supervising an LOA, th is shall 

--- Document Chunk 3895 ---
always be considered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of 

--- Document Chunk 3896 ---
the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based

information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.8.5.2 It shall be possi ble to update the length of an MA section by means of repositioning 

--- Document Chunk 3899 ---
information contained in a balise group message (see section 3.8.5.3). 

--- Document Chunk 3900 ---
3.8.5.2.1 Note: The concerned MA section need not be the end section.

announced a following balise group as unknown but containing repositioning

3.8.5.2.3 A balise group messa ge containing a movement authority shall not contain

repositioning information for the same direction. 

--- Document Chunk 3907 ---
3.8.5.2.3.1 Note: It is possible to combine repositioning with an infill MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3908 ---
3.8.5.2.4 The reception of repositioning information or of a new MA with an LOA shall not be

3.8.6.1 It shall be possible to shorten a given MA using a special procedure between on -board 

--- Document Chunk 4172 ---
equipment and RBC. The procedure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 4173 ---
a) The RBC proposes a new MA with an EOA closer to the train than the current 

--- Document Chunk 4174 ---
EOA/LOA, optionally with a mode profile.

b) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall check the train front end position 

--- Document Chunk 4187 ---
versus the Indication supervision limit of the proposed shortened MA. 

--- Document Chunk 4188 ---
 If it is in rear, the on-board equipment shall accept the new MA. 

--- Document Chunk 4189 ---
 If it is in advance , the request shall be rejected and the previously received MA 

--- Document Chunk 4190 ---
remains valid 

--- Document Chunk 4191 ---
c) The RBC shall be informed about the decision. 

--- Document Chunk 4192 ---
3.8.6.2 If the request from the RBC is granted by the on -board, refer to appendix A.3.4 for the 

--- Document Chunk 4193 ---
exhaustive list of location based information, which shall be deleted accordingly.

3.9 Means to transmit Infill information (Level 1 only) 

--- Document Chunk 4195 ---
3.9.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 4196 ---
3.9.1.1 It shall be possible to transmit infill information to the on-board equipment using 

--- Document Chunk 4197 ---
a) Balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 4198 ---
b) Euroloops 

--- Document Chunk 4199 ---
c) Radio infill units. 

--- Document Chunk 4200 ---
3.9.1.1.1 If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes infill 

--- Document Chunk 4201 ---
information, those devices are also identified as infill devices. 

--- Document Chunk 4202 ---
3.9.1.2 The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of 

--- Document Chunk 4203 ---
transmission media. 

--- Document Chunk 4204 ---
3.9.1.3 If the on -board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested 

--- Document Chunk 4205 ---
by the announcement balise group, the announcement information  shall be ignored by 

--- Document Chunk 4206 ---
the on -board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously 

--- Document Chunk 4207 ---
received information.  

--- Document Chunk 4208 ---
3.9.1.4 Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already 

--- Document Chunk 4209 ---
covered in previous chapters). 

--- Document Chunk 4210 ---
3.9.2 Infill by loop 

--- Document Chunk 4211 ---
3.9.2.1 An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the 

--- Document Chunk 4212 ---
end of a loop. When receiving this information, the on -board equipment knows that it is 

--- Document Chunk 4213 ---
entering/leaving a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it is 

--- Document Chunk 4214 ---
possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop. 

--- Document Chunk 4215 ---
3.9.2.2 Balise groups shall be used as EOLMs. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM 

--- Document Chunk 4216 ---
information to the passing train.  

--- Document Chunk 4217 ---
3.9.2.3 EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The g eneral 

--- Document Chunk 4218 ---
rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

3.9.2.8 Deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 4236 ---
3.9.2.9 The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for 

--- Document Chunk 4237 ---
reception of the loop information: 

--- Document Chunk 4238 ---
 Loop identity used to identify the loop.  

--- Document Chunk 4239 ---
 Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop telegrams. 

--- Document Chunk 4240 ---
 Distance to the loop giving the distance from the EOLM to the location from where 

--- Document Chunk 4241 ---
on loop messages can be received.  

--- Document Chunk 4242 ---
 Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be 

--- Document Chunk 4243 ---
received.  

--- Document Chunk 4244 ---
 Indicator telling the on -board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or 

--- Document Chunk 4245 ---
reverse to the orientation of the announcing EOLM.  

--- Document Chunk 4246 ---
3.9.2.10 The on-board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing 

--- Document Chunk 4247 ---
the EOLM. 

--- Document Chunk 4248 ---
3.9.2.11 When the on -board equipment reads  the next main signal balise group or when it 

--- Document Chunk 4249 ---
detects that the next main signal balise group was missed, new infill information 

--- Document Chunk 4250 ---
possibly received from the loop shall be ignored. 

--- Document Chunk 4251 ---
3.9.2.12 The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for  

--- Document Chunk 4252 ---
diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop 

--- Document Chunk 4253 ---
telegrams to specific locations. 

--- Document Chunk 4254 ---
3.9.3 Infill by radio 

--- Document Chunk 4255 ---
3.9.3.1 In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment orders to 

--- Document Chunk 4256 ---
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  

--- Document Chunk 4257 ---
3.9.3.2 The orders shall be sent via balise groups or via Radio Infill units.

3.9.3.3 The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored: 

--- Document Chunk 4259 ---
a) Intentionally deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 4260 ---
b) If the on-board equipment does not include radio.  

--- Document Chunk 4261 ---
3.9.3.4 If the on -board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be

a) If only one RIU communication session is ongoing , maintain the existing 

--- Document Chunk 4287 ---
communication session and establish a new one with the RIU indicated in the order. 

--- Document Chunk 4288 ---
b) If two RIU communication sessions are ongoing, maintain the communication 

--- Document Chunk 4289 ---

3.11 Static Speed Restrictions and Gradients 

--- Document Chunk 4473 ---
3.11.1 Introduction  

--- Document Chunk 4474 ---
3.11.1.1 The permitted speed at which the train is allowed to travel shall be limited to different 

--- Document Chunk 4475 ---
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions. 

--- Document Chunk 4476 ---
3.11.1.2 A Static Speed Restriction shall be handled in the same way independent of ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 4477 ---
level. 

--- Document Chunk 4478 ---
3.11.2 Definition of Static Speed Restriction 

--- Document Chunk 4479 ---
3.11.2.1 Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train 

--- Document Chunk 4480 ---
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 4481 ---
3.11.2.2 There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:   

--- Document Chunk 4482 ---
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP) 

--- Document Chunk 4483 ---
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP) 

--- Document Chunk 4484 ---
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR) 

--- Document Chunk 4485 ---
d) Maximum Train Speed 

--- Document Chunk 4486 ---
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1) 

--- Document Chunk 4487 ---
f) Mode related Speed Restriction. 

--- Document Chunk 4488 ---
g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Subset-035) 

--- Document Chunk 4489 ---
h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset-035) 

--- Document Chunk 4490 ---
i) Level Crossing speed restriction (LX SR) 

--- Document Chunk 4491 ---
j) Override function related Speed Restriction 

--- Document Chunk 4492 ---
k) Speed restriction to ens ure a given permitted braking distance (PBD SR) (see 

--- Document Chunk 4493 ---
3.11.11) 

--- Document Chunk 4494 ---
3.11.2.3 The Static Speed Restriction categories are independent of each other. This means 

--- Document Chunk 4495 ---
that one speed restriction category cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other 

--- Document Chunk 4496 ---
category of Static Speed Restrictions.

3.11.3 Static Speed Profile (SSP) 

--- Document Chunk 4521 ---
3.11.3.1.1 The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed spee d restrictions of a 

--- Document Chunk 4522 ---
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed, 

--- Document Chunk 4523 ---
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges. 

--- Document Chunk 4524 ---
3.11.3.1.2 The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent. 

--- Document Chunk 4525 ---
The relationship b etween track and train characteristics determine s the individual 

--- Document Chunk 4526 ---
Static Speed Profile for each train.  

--- Document Chunk 4527 ---
3.11.3.1.3 It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static 

--- Document Chunk 4528 ---
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limi t than the speed limit 

--- Document Chunk 4529 ---
specified for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element. 

--- Document Chunk 4530 ---
3.11.3.2 Static Speed Profile Categories 

--- Document Chunk 4531 ---
3.11.3.2.1 It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP 

--- Document Chunk 4532 ---
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4533 ---
3.11.3.2.1.1 The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types:

--- Document Chunk 4544 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 4545 ---
a) The “Cant Deficiency” SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one 

--- Document Chunk 4546 ---
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by sus pension design, at 

--- Document Chunk 4547 ---
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific 

--- Document Chunk 4548 ---
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category. 

--- Document Chunk 4549 ---
b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories 

--- Document Chunk 4550 ---
corresponding to the other international train categories 

--- Document Chunk 4551 ---
3.11.3.2.1.2 Whenever the type of specific SSP category is not explicitly specified in the 

--- Document Chunk 4552 ---
following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of 

--- Document Chunk 4553 ---
specific SSP categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4554 ---
3.11.3.2.2 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall: 

--- Document Chunk 4555 ---
a) always give the Basic SSP, which shall be considered as the default “Cant 

--- Document Chunk 4556 ---
Deficiency” SSP 

--- Document Chunk 4557 ---
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs 

--- Document Chunk 4558 ---
c) specify, for each “other specific” SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Can t 

--- Document Chunk 4559 ---
Deficiency” SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment according to 

--- Document Chunk 4560 ---
3.11.3.2.3

--- Document Chunk 4563 ---
following order of preference: 

--- Document Chunk 4564 ---
a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matching its “Cant Deficiency” train category, 

--- Document Chunk 4565 ---
OR 

--- Document Chunk 4566 ---
b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP with the highest Cant Deficiency value below

3.11.3.2.6 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, t he ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in a 

--- Document Chunk 4573 ---
train belonging to at least one or more “other international” train categories shall use 

--- Document Chunk 4574 ---
the most restrictive speed amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 4575 ---
a) the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other

specific” SSP categories matching the train categories replaces the ” Cant 

--- Document Chunk 4577 ---

--- Document Chunk 4592 ---
3.11.3.3.1 A maximum of 31 train categories is defined to match the SSP categories. 16 “Cant 

--- Document Chunk 4593 ---
Deficiency” train categories and 15 “other international” train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4594 ---
3.11.3.3.2 A train shall always belong to one and only one “Cant Deficiency”  train category and 

--- Document Chunk 4595 ---
may optionally belong to one or more “other international” train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4596 ---
3.11.3.3.3 The train category(ies) to which a train belongs is a part of its Train Data. 

--- Document Chunk 4597 ---
3.11.4 Axle load Speed Profile 

--- Document Chunk 4598 ---
3.11.4.1 It shall be possible to define an Axle load Speed Profile as a non-continuous profile. 

--- Document Chunk 4599 ---
3.11.4.2 For each section with a speed restriction due to axle load, the different speed value(s) 

--- Document Chunk 4600 ---
and for which minimum axle load category this speed value(s) applies shall be 

--- Document Chunk 4601 ---
specified. 

--- Document Chunk 4602 ---
3.11.4.2.1 Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category can be 

--- Document Chunk 4603 ---
applicable to the same distance. 

--- Document Chunk 4604 ---
3.11.4.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall consider the most restrictive speed 

--- Document Chunk 4605 ---
restriction that is associated with any axle load category  lower than, or equal to that of 

--- Document Chunk 4606 ---
the train. 

--- Document Chunk 4607 ---
3.11.4.4 For trains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given 

--- Document Chunk 4608 ---
in the profile , the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall not consider any speed 

--- Document Chunk 4609 ---
restriction due to axle load. 

--- Document Chunk 4610 ---
3.11.4.5 The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be “no restriction due to axle load”. 

--- Document Chunk 4611 ---
3.11.4.6 Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with 

--- Document Chunk 4612 ---
train length, shall be determined by the axle load speed pr ofile information sent to the 

--- Document Chunk 4613 ---
on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 4614 ---
3.11.5 Temporary Speed Restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 4615 ---
3.11.5.1 The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of 

--- Document Chunk 4616 ---
track infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc. 

--- Document Chunk 4617 ---
3.11.5.2 All Temporary Speed Restrictions are independent of each other. This means that an 

--- Document Chunk 4618 ---
individual Temporary Speed Restriction cannot affect, nor be affected by, any other 

--- Document Chunk 4619 ---
individual Temporary Speed Restriction. 

--- Document Chunk 4620 ---
3.11.5.3 Whether a speed increase after the temporary speed restricti on shall be delayed with 

--- Document Chunk 4621 ---
train length, shall be determined by the temporary speed restriction information sent to 

--- Document Chunk 4622 ---
the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 4623 ---
3.11.5.4 When two or more temporary speed restrictions overlap, the most restrictive speed of 

--- Document Chunk 4624 ---
the overlapping temporary speed restrictions shall be used in the area of overlap.

train length. 

--- Document Chunk 4640 ---
3.11.5.6 It shall be possible to identify whether a Temporary Speed Restriction is possible to

3.11.5.8 Temporary Speed Restrictions shall only be revoked on request from the trackside.  

--- Document Chunk 4645 ---
3.11.5.9 If the on-board equipment receives a new Temporary Speed Restriction (TSR) with the 

--- Document Chunk 4646 ---
same identity as an already received TSR, the new Tempo rary Speed Restriction shall 

--- Document Chunk 4647 ---
replace the previous one, except when the Temporary Speed Restriction is identified 

--- Document Chunk 4648 ---
as non revocable in which case this shall be considered as an additional TSR. 

--- Document Chunk 4649 ---
3.11.5.10 In case the train has changed its orientation any Temporary Speed  Restriction shall be 

--- Document Chunk 4650 ---
deleted (operational requirement: will be executed due to the mode change). 

--- Document Chunk 4651 ---
3.11.5.11 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 4652 ---
3.11.5.12 It shall be possible for the RBC to order an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in Level 

--- Document Chunk 4653 ---
2 or 3 to reject revocable TSRs from balises. 

--- Document Chunk 4654 ---
3.11.5.13 When ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has accepted an order to reject revocable 

--- Document Chunk 4655 ---
TSRs from balises, this inhibition shall be stored and shall be effective immediately, 

--- Document Chunk 4656 ---
but only for revocable TSRs received from balises thereafter.  

--- Document Chunk 4657 ---
3.11.5.14 The inhibition of revocable TSRs f rom balises shall be deleted if any of the following

occurs: 

--- Document Chunk 4659 ---
 the communication session established with the RBC that ordered the inhibition is 

--- Document Chunk 4660 ---
terminated, OR 

--- Document Chunk 4661 ---
 in case of RBC/RBC handover, the train front end crosses the RBC/RBC border. 

--- Document Chunk 4662 ---
3.11.5.15 Note: this inhibition  may be useful in Level 1 / Level 2 mixed signalling applications 

--- Document Chunk 4663 ---
when the RBC has more precise information about restrictions than can be given from

3.11.6 Signalling related speed restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 4667 ---
3.11.6.1 In level 1, it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment a speed restriction

3.11.10 Override function related Speed Restriction 

--- Document Chunk 4726 ---
3.11.10.1 While the “override” function is active, the override speed limit (national /default value) 

--- Document Chunk 4727 ---
shall be taken into account. 

--- Document Chunk 4728 ---
3.11.11 Speed restriction to ensure permitted braking distance 

--- Document Chunk 4729 ---
3.11.11.1 It shall be possible for trackside t o request the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment to 

--- Document Chunk 4730 ---
calculate a speed restriction based on a permitted braking distance given by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 4731 ---
3.11.11.2 The order shall be given by means of a non-continuous profile defining: 

--- Document Chunk 4732 ---
 The start and end location for the speed restriction 

--- Document Chunk 4733 ---
 The permitted braking distance (PBD) used to calculate the speed restriction value 

--- Document Chunk 4734 ---
 Whether the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the Service Brake or 

--- Document Chunk 4735 ---
Emergency Brake 

--- Document Chunk 4736 ---
 A single gradient value applicable for the calculation 

--- Document Chunk 4737 ---
3.11.11.3 The speed restriction shall be calculated when the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 4738 ---
receives the permitted braking distance information from trackside, and shall be re -

--- Document Chunk 4739 ---
calculated only if any of the inputs taken into account for the calculation of the speed 

--- Document Chunk 4740 ---
restriction changes. 

--- Document Chunk 4741 ---
3.11.11.4 The calculation of the speed restriction by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 4742 ---
take into account that: 

--- Document Chunk 4743 ---
 The single gradient value received from trackside shall be compensated in value 

--- Document Chunk 4744 ---
according to the rotating mass as defined in 3.13.4.3. 

--- Document Chunk 4745 ---
 The safe deceleration shall be computed as in 3.13.6.2.1 but without considering 

--- Document Chunk 4746 ---
the adhesion profiles , the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track 

--- Document Chunk 4747 ---
conditions related to powerless section given by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 4748 ---
 The expected deceleration shall be com puted as in 3.13.6.3.1 but without 

--- Document Chunk 4749 ---
considering the track conditions related to brake inhibition and the track conditions 

--- Document Chunk 4750 ---
related to powerless section given by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 4751 ---
 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall calculate an Emergency Brake 

--- Document Chunk 4752 ---
Deceleration (EBD ) curve based on the safe deceleration and that reaches zero 

--- Document Chunk 4753 ---
speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance. 

--- Document Chunk 4754 ---
 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, the 

--- Document Chunk 4755 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also calculate a S ervice Brake 

--- Document Chunk 4756 ---
Deceleration (SBD) curve based on the expected deceleration and that reaches 

--- Document Chunk 4757 ---
zero speed at a distance equal to the permitted braking distance. 

--- Document Chunk 4758 ---
 The estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero”. 

--- Document Chunk 4759 ---
 If not inhibited by National Value, the compensat ion of the inaccuracy of the speed 

--- Document Chunk 4760 ---
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed, as defined in 

--- Document Chunk 4761 ---

permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake;

V_delta0PBD = f41(V_PBD + dV_SBI(V_PBD))  if the permitted braking distance is 

--- Document Chunk 4775 ---
to be achieved with the service brake. 

--- Document Chunk 4776 ---
 The train will travel a distance from the last encountered balise of a group that 

--- Document Chunk 4777 ---
provides restrictive information until initiating the br ake command. This travelled 

--- Document Chunk 4778 ---
distance shall be set to a value calculated from the PBD speed considering a 

--- Document Chunk 4779 ---
processing delay (T41) equal to SUBSET-041 § 5.2.1.1. 

--- Document Chunk 4780 ---
 Regardless of how the service brake feedback is actually configured (see 

--- Document Chunk 4781 ---
3.13.2.2.7.2), T_bs1 and  T_bs2 (see 3.13.9.3.3) shall be defined as if the service 

--- Document Chunk 4782 ---
brake feedback was not implemented. 

--- Document Chunk 4783 ---
 Regardless of how the traction cut -off interface is actually configured (see 

--- Document Chunk 4784 ---
3.13.2.2.8), T_traction (see 3.13.9.3.2) shall be defined as if the traction cut -off was 

--- Document Chunk 4785 ---
not implemented. 

--- Document Chunk 4786 ---
3.11.11.4.1 Note: Knowing how the PBD speed restriction is computed by the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 4787 ---
board equipment, it is the responsibility of the trackside to set the appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 4788 ---
permitted braking distance with regard to the risk of not initiating the br ake command 

--- Document Chunk 4789 ---
in due time when encountering a further balise group providing restrictive information. 

--- Document Chunk 4790 ---
In other words, if deemed necessary, the trackside can include provisions based on 

--- Document Chunk 4791 ---
the characteristics of the balise group providing restrictive information  e.g. distances 

--- Document Chunk 4792 ---
between balises in that group with regards to validity direction of transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 4793 ---
information and balise group orientation, accuracy of balise location. 

--- Document Chunk 4794 ---
3.11.11.4.2 Note: If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the service brake, it is the 

--- Document Chunk 4795 ---
responsibility of the trackside to also consider an estimation of the on-board over-

--- Document Chunk 4796 ---
reading and under-reading amounts at the time the brake command is initiated in order 

--- Document Chunk 4797 ---
to lower the likelihood of the max safe front end of the train reaching the EBI 

--- Document Chunk 4798 ---
supervision limit. 

--- Document Chunk 4799 ---
3.11.11.5 Note: Throughout the following formulas, all the distances marked with “d” (lower case) 

--- Document Chunk 4800 ---
are counted from a single arbitrary reference location. 

--- Document Chunk 4801 ---
3.11.11.6 If the permitted braking distance is to be achieved with the emergency brake, the 

--- Document Chunk 4802 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall seek the PBD speed restriction value 

--- Document Chunk 4803 ---
(V_PBD) which satisfies the two following inequalities. The resulting value shall then

be rounded down to the next lower multiple of 5km/h:

a) As always ending the text display, regardless of the end condition defined in 

--- Document Chunk 5186 ---
3.12.3.4.3.1 

--- Document Chunk 5187 ---
b) As a necessary condition to end the text display, in addition to the end condition

On Sight mode, Limited Supervision mode and Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 5229 ---
3.12.4.2 For OS and LS mode the mode profile define s the entry and the length of the On

by, any other individual LX information. 

--- Document Chunk 5248 ---
3.12.5.3 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment receives a new LX information with the same

3.13 Speed and distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 5271 ---
3.13.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 5272 ---
3.13.1.1 The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus 

--- Document Chunk 5273 ---
its position, in order to ass ure that the train remains within the given speed and 

--- Document Chunk 5274 ---
distance limits. 

--- Document Chunk 5275 ---
3.13.1.1.1 Note: The speed and distance monitoring of the on -board can only assure this when 

--- Document Chunk 5276 ---
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 5277 ---
 Brake system of the train functions as specified 

--- Document Chunk 5278 ---
 wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 5279 ---
 Brake characteristics (and other Train related inputs) are correctly entered into the 

--- Document Chunk 5280 ---
on-board 

--- Document Chunk 5281 ---
3.13.1.2 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes 

--- Document Chunk 5282 ---
them, it may also re ceive status information if the brakes are applied or released. 

--- Document Chunk 5283 ---
However, it cannot be made responsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment 

--- Document Chunk 5284 ---
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake 

--- Document Chunk 5285 ---
command is an implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 5286 ---
3.13.1.3 Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements contributing to the speed and 

--- Document Chunk 5287 ---
distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the 

--- Document Chunk 5288 ---

3.13.2.1.2 However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within 

--- Document Chunk 5448 ---
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore 

--- Document Chunk 5449 ---
incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring. 

--- Document Chunk 5450 ---
3.13.2.1.3 The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking 

--- Document Chunk 5451 ---
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are 

--- Document Chunk 5452 ---
required for reference conditions set by trackside.

3.13.2.2 Train related inputs 

--- Document Chunk 5454 ---
3.13.2.2.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 5455 ---
3.13.2.2.1.1 The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are: 

--- Document Chunk 5456 ---
a) Traction model 

--- Document Chunk 5457 ---
b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake 

--- Document Chunk 5458 ---
percentage 

--- Document Chunk 5459 ---
c) Brake position 

--- Document Chunk 5460 ---
d) Special brakes (interface configuration and status) 

--- Document Chunk 5461 ---
e) Service brake (interface configuration and application) 

--- Document Chunk 5462 ---
f) Traction cut-off interface 

--- Document Chunk 5463 ---
g) On-board correction factors 

--- Document Chunk 5464 ---
h) Nominal rotating mass 

--- Document Chunk 5465 ---
i) Train length 

--- Document Chunk 5466 ---
j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 5467 ---
k)  Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed) 

--- Document Chunk 5468 ---
3.13.2.2.1.2 These train related inputs are acquired as Train Data (see 3.18.3.2 items b) c) and 

--- Document Chunk 5469 ---
d)), except: 

--- Document Chunk 5470 ---
 the configuration of the special brakes, service brake and traction cut -off interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 5471 ---
which are not affected by the Train Data acquisition, 

--- Document Chunk 5472 ---
 the service brake application and the special brakes statuses which are 

--- Document Chunk 5473 ---
continuously acquired on the Train Interface, 

--- Document Chunk 5474 ---
 the fixed values. 

--- Document Chunk 5475 ---
3.13.2.2.1.3 The speed and distance monitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train 

--- Document Chunk 5476 ---
Data, unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model 

--- Document Chunk 5477 ---
is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits). 

--- Document Chunk 5478 ---
3.13.2.2.2 Traction model 

--- Document Chunk 5479 ---
3.13.2.2.2.1 The traction model shall be given as a step function as indicated in Figure 29. It 

--- Document Chunk 5480 ---

--- Document Chunk 5508 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.2 It shall be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent

3.13.2.2.3.1.3 Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as

3.13.2.2.3.1.4 The last step o f A_brake(V) shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it 

--- Document Chunk 5538 ---
has no upper speed limit. 

--- Document Chunk 5539 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.5 The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full 

--- Document Chunk 5540 ---
in Figure 31) 

--- Document Chunk 5541 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.6 The model shall be used for the  emergency brake nominal deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 5542 ---
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 

--- Document Chunk 5543 ---
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)). 

--- Document Chunk 5544 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.7 It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of

A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V)  for each combination of use of 

--- Document Chunk 5546 ---
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake. 

--- Document Chunk 5547 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.8 Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence 

--- Document Chunk 5548 ---
of a specifi c brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the 

--- Document Chunk 5549 ---
choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for 

--- Document Chunk 5550 ---
A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an 

--- Document Chunk 5551 ---
ETCS implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 5552 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.9 It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of 

--- Document Chunk 5553 ---
A_brake_normal_service(V): 

--- Document Chunk 5554 ---
a) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G”

b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight

--- Document Chunk 5557 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.10 A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full

service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0): 

--- Document Chunk 5559 ---
If A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB01

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V)

Figure 31: Brake Build Up Time Model 

--- Document Chunk 5591 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.3 In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 5592 ---
a) T_brake_react (t0…t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on -

--- Document Chunk 5593 ---
board and the moment the brake force starts to build up. 

--- Document Chunk 5594 ---
b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the 

--- Document Chunk 5595 ---
zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached. 

--- Document Chunk 5596 ---
c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time. 

--- Document Chunk 5597 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.4 The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as 

--- Document Chunk 5598 ---
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase. 

--- Document Chunk 5599 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.5 This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake 

--- Document Chunk 5600 ---
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service). 

--- Document Chunk 5601 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.6 Note: The equivale nt brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning 

--- Document Chunk 5602 ---
of the build -up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is 

--- Document Chunk 5603 ---
compensated by a higher deceleration. 

--- Document Chunk 5604 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.7 Note: T_brake_react and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for 

--- Document Chunk 5605 ---
completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the 

--- Document Chunk 5606 ---
speed and distance monitoring function. 

--- Document Chunk 5607 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.8 It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency and 

--- Document Chunk 5608 ---
T_brake_service for each  combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current 

--- Document Chunk 5609 ---
brake, magnetic shoe brake and Ep brake.

3.13.3.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 5999 ---
3.13.3.1.1 For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can 

--- Document Chunk 6000 ---
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to pre -

--- Document Chunk 6001 ---
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only 

--- Document Chunk 6002 ---
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include 

--- Document Chunk 6003 ---
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from 

--- Document Chunk 6004 ---
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models 

--- Document Chunk 6005 ---

3.13.4.1.2 The default gradient for TSR shall be compensated in value according to the rotating 

--- Document Chunk 6145 ---
mass as defined in 3.13.4.3. 

--- Document Chunk 6146 ---
3.13.4.1.3 For all loca tions not covered by the gradient profile, the on -board shall consider the 

--- Document Chunk 6147 ---
gradient value as: 

--- Document Chunk 6148 ---
a) the default gradient for TSR, if available and if the concerned target is due to a TSR 

--- Document Chunk 6149 ---
b) zero, for other cases. 

--- Document Chunk 6150 ---
3.13.4.2 Train length compensation 

--- Document Chunk 6151 ---
3.13.4.2.1 Assuming that a fictive tr ain front end would be at any location between the current 

--- Document Chunk 6152 ---
(actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall 

--- Document Chunk 6153 ---
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by 

--- Document Chunk 6154 ---
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of 

--- Document Chunk 6155 ---
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35). 

--- Document Chunk 6156 ---
3.13.4.3 Rotating mass 

--- Document Chunk 6157 ---
3.13.4.3.1 The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see 

--- Document Chunk 6158 ---
Figure 35). 

--- Document Chunk 6159 ---
3.13.4.3.1.1 Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of 

--- Document Chunk 6160 ---
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating 

--- Document Chunk 6161 ---
mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy 

--- Document Chunk 6162 ---
added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. 

--- Document Chunk 6163 ---
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same 

--- Document Chunk 6164 ---
train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travel s the same distance from H1 to 

--- Document Chunk 6165 ---
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is 

--- Document Chunk 6166 ---
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear 

--- Document Chunk 6167 ---
forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acce leration which is less than for 

--- Document Chunk 6168 ---
the train without rotating mass. 

--- Document Chunk 6169 ---
3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it 

--- Document Chunk 6170 ---
is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 6171 ---
3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used: 

--- Document Chunk 6172 ---
a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown: 

--- Document Chunk 6173 ---
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)

--- Document Chunk 6583 ---
SvL temporarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored 

--- Document Chunk 6584 ---

--- Document Chunk 6585 ---
3.13.8.2.3 A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the

3.13.8.5.1 The purpose of the guidance curve (GUI) is to provide a comfortable way of brak ing for

the driver, to avoid excessive wear of the brakes and to save traction energy. 

--- Document Chunk 6669 ---
3.13.8.5.2 If the National Value does not inhibit them, the on -board shall calculate a guidance

--- Document Chunk 6671 ---
deceleration A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where

--- Document Chunk 6679 ---
 Service brake intervention (SBI) 

--- Document Chunk 6680 ---
 Warning (W)

3.13.9.1.2 The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the 

--- Document Chunk 6696 ---
train will remain within the various limits (in distance/speed) imposed by the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 6697 ---
3.13.9.1.3 The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an 

--- Document Chunk 6698 ---
emergency brake intervention by maintaining the speed of the train within the 

--- Document Chunk 6699 ---
appropriate limits. 

--- Document Chunk 6700 ---
3.13.9.2 Ceiling supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 6701 ---
3.13.9.2.1 The ceiling supervision limits are derived from the MRSP elements, where the speed is

V_delta0 = V_ura (see Figure 45). 

--- Document Chunk 6840 ---
3.13.9.3.2.2 The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application 

--- Document Chunk 6841 ---
of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts: 

--- Document Chunk 6842 ---
a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction 

--- Document Chunk 6843 ---
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem 

--- Document Chunk 6844 ---
3.13.9.3.2.3 The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 6845 ---
a) when the traction cut-off is implemented: 

--- Document Chunk 6846 ---
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0). 

--- Document Chunk 6847 ---
b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off 

--- Document Chunk 6848 ---
3.13.9.3.2.4 Note: When the traction cut -off is implemented , the traction cut -off command is 

--- Document Chunk 6849 ---
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the 

--- Document Chunk 6850 ---
equation above takes this into account, assuming that the warning limit is derived from 

--- Document Chunk 6851 ---
the EBD. 

--- Document Chunk 6852 ---
3.13.9.3.2.5 T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.4. 

--- Document Chunk 6853 ---
3.13.9.3.2.6 The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MAX(T_be - 

--- Document Chunk 6854 ---
T_traction ; 0). 

--- Document Chunk 6855 ---
3.13.9.3.2.7 Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless 

--- Document Chunk 6856 ---
included to make the specifications complete. 

--- Document Chunk 6857 ---
3.13.9.3.2.8 During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one measured at 

--- Document Chunk 6858 ---
the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values. 

--- Document Chunk 6859 ---
3.13.9.3.2.9 If T_be > T_traction, the estimated accelerat ion during T_berem (A_est2) shall be 

--- Document Chunk 6860 ---
the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values 

--- Document Chunk 6861 ---
between 0 and +0.4m/s2. 

--- Document Chunk 6862 ---
3.13.9.3.2.10 The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed 

--- Document Chunk 6863 ---

3.13.9.3.6.2 If the service brake feedback interfa ce is not available for use, then  T_indication 

--- Document Chunk 7365 ---
shall be calculated as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 7366 ---
   driverbsindication TsTT  5,8.0max

--- Document Chunk 7367 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 7368 ---
3.13.9.3.6.3 Note: The reduction of T_indication by a factor is intended to improve performance 

--- Document Chunk 7369 ---
and the feasibility of this reduction is based on experience with real implementations. 

--- Document Chunk 7370 ---
To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication, 

--- Document Chunk 7371 ---
giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake. 

--- Document Chunk 7372 ---
3.13.9.3.6.4 If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication shall be 

--- Document Chunk 7373 ---
equal to 5s + T_driver. 

--- Document Chunk 7374 ---
3.13.9.4 Release speed supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 7375 ---
3.13.9.4.1 The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 7376 ---
The EBI supervision limit is equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I 

--- Document Chunk 7377 ---
supervision limit associated to the release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 7378 ---
3.13.9.4.2 Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to 

--- Document Chunk 7379 ---
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zero and might be 

--- Document Chunk 7380 ---
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the meas ured distance. 

--- Document Chunk 7381 ---
The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the 

--- Document Chunk 7382 ---
balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be 

--- Document Chunk 7383 ---
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the dis tance from the 

--- Document Chunk 7384 ---
EOA to the Supervised Location. 

--- Document Chunk 7385 ---
3.13.9.4.3 With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to: 

--- Document Chunk 7386 ---
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR 

--- Document Chunk 7387 ---
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR 

--- Document Chunk 7388 ---
c) Instruct the on-board to use the national value. 

--- Document Chunk 7389 ---
3.13.9.4.4 In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release 

--- Document Chunk 7390 ---
speed shall be supervised. 

--- Document Chunk 7391 ---
3.13.9.4.5 Note: When the release speed is given as a fixed value from trackside, the 

--- Document Chunk 7392 ---
ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopp ing the train in rear of the 

--- Document Chunk 7393 ---
Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 7394 ---
manager to set the appropriate release speed with regard to the risk of passing the 

--- Document Chunk 7395 ---
Supervised Location. 

--- Document Chunk 7396 ---
3.13.9.4.6 The start location of the release s peed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit 

--- Document Chunk 7397 ---
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed 

--- Document Chunk 7398 ---
value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SBI supervision limit among the SBI1 

--- Document Chunk 7399 ---
related to EOA, the SBI2 rel ated to SvL  and, when the Release Speed is calculated 

--- Document Chunk 7400 ---

3.13.10.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 7631 ---
3.13.10.1.1 By comparing the train speed and position to the various supervision limits defined in 

--- Document Chunk 7632 ---
the previous section, the on -board equipment generates braking commands, traction 

--- Document Chunk 7633 ---
cut-off commands and relevant information to the driver.  The information displayed t o 

--- Document Chunk 7634 ---
the driver is selected according to the following supervision statuses of the speed and 

--- Document Chunk 7635 ---
distance monitoring function: Normal status, Indication status, Overspeed status, 

--- Document Chunk 7636 ---
Warning status and Intervention status. 

--- Document Chunk 7637 ---
3.13.10.1.2 The following types of speed and distance monitoring are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 7638 ---
 Ceiling speed monitoring (CSM) 

--- Document Chunk 7639 ---
 Target speed monitoring (TSM)

3.13.10.1.3 Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run 

--- Document Chunk 7666 ---
without the need to brake to a target. 

--- Document Chunk 7667 ---
3.13.10.1.4 Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the 

--- Document Chunk 7668 ---
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and wit hin which the 

--- Document Chunk 7669 ---
train brakes to a target. 

--- Document Chunk 7670 ---
3.13.10.1.5 Release speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area close to 

--- Document Chunk 7671 ---
the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 7672 ---
3.13.10.2 General requirements 

--- Document Chunk 7673 ---
3.13.10.2.1 The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the 

--- Document Chunk 7674 ---
speed monitoring. This shall be the estimated speed. 

--- Document Chunk 7675 ---
3.13.10.2.2 Once a Train Interface command (traction cut -off, service brake or emergency brake) 

--- Document Chunk 7676 ---
is triggered, the on -board shall apply it until its correspondi ng revocation condition is 

--- Document Chunk 7677 ---
met. 

--- Document Chunk 7678 ---
3.13.10.2.3 If there is no on-board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 7679 ---
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring), 

--- Document Chunk 7680 ---
whenever a service brake command is specified, the eme rgency brake command shall 

--- Document Chunk 7681 ---
be triggered instead. 

--- Document Chunk 7682 ---
3.13.10.2.4 The emergency brake command, which is triggered instead of the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 7683 ---
command when an SBI supervision limit is exceeded, shall be revoked according to 

--- Document Chunk 7684 ---

If none of the remaining targets from the list of concerned targets is masked by 

--- Document Chunk 8096 ---
MRDT0 or if there is no other remaining target to check in the list of con cerned 

--- Document Chunk 8097 ---
targets, then the MRDT shall be the target obtained from the previous step (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 8098 ---
MRDT0). 

--- Document Chunk 8099 ---
... 

--- Document Chunk 8100 ---
 Step n: the on -board shall apply step n -1, substituting MRDT n-2 with MRDTn-1 and 

--- Document Chunk 8101 ---
checking the list of concerned targets excluding the targets which have bee n 

--- Document Chunk 8102 ---
preselected as MRDT in all the previous steps (i.e. from MRDT 0 to MRDT n-1 

--- Document Chunk 8103 ---
inclusive). 

--- Document Chunk 8104 ---
3.13.10.4.2.1 Note 1: the above process for the determination of the MRDT ensures that in all 

--- Document Chunk 8105 ---
circumstances (especially when several targets are close to each other) it is avoided 

--- Document Chunk 8106 ---
that a target is displayed after its Indication supervision limit has been reached.

3.13.10.4.2.2 Note 2: when entering target speed monitoring, there is by definition at least one 

--- Document Chunk 8119 ---
target that satisfies the conditions to be selected as MRDT. Afterwards (e.g. due to 

--- Document Chunk 8120 ---
train braking) it is possible that no target satisfies any more the conditions to be 

--- Document Chunk 8121 ---
selected as MRDT, which however only means that the target previously selected 

--- Document Chunk 8122 ---
remains the MRDT (see clause 3.13.10.4.5). 

--- Document Chunk 8123 ---
3.13.10.4.2.3 Note 3: if MRDTn-1 is a target at zero speed (e.g. EOA or SvL), then it is always 

--- Document Chunk 8124 ---
selected as MRDT, i.e. no other target can be selected as MRDT as per step n.

3.13.10.4.8.1 As long as the displayed values are locked due to SB feedback (see Appendix 

--- Document Chunk 8221 ---

--- Document Chunk 8222 ---
speed, the displayed SBI speed (if any) and the distance to target never increase (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 8223 ---
due to the reduction of T_bs1 and T_bs 2 or e.g. due to relocation). In other terms if a 

--- Document Chunk 8224 ---
concerned displayed value (VP_DMI, VSBI_DMI or target distance) calculated as 

--- Document Chunk 8225 ---
above has a higher value than the previously displayed value, then the previous value 

--- Document Chunk 8226 ---
shall remain displayed until a further calculated value is lower than the displayed one.

a) The service brake command is not implemented, OR 

--- Document Chunk 8229 ---
b) The national value inhibits its use. 

--- Document Chunk 8230 ---
3.13.10.4.10 The on -board equipment shall compare the  estimated speed and train position 

--- Document Chunk 8231 ---
with the ceiling and braking to target supervision limits and shall trigger /revoke 

--- Document Chunk 8232 ---
commands to the train interface (traction cut -off if implemented, service brake if 

--- Document Chunk 8233 ---
available for use or emergency brake) and supervision statuses, by evaluating and 

--- Document Chunk 8234 ---
taking into account the conditions as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.10.1. 

--- Document Chunk 8235 ---
3.13.10.4.10.1 The conditions in Table 8 and Table 10 shall be evaluated for each target related to

3.13.10.4.16 When the speed and distance monitoring function becomes active and the target 

--- Document Chunk 8832 ---
speed monitoring is the first one entered, the triggering conditio n t3 defined in Table 8 

--- Document Chunk 8833 ---
or Table 9 shall be checked for each target in order to determine whether the 

--- Document Chunk 8834 ---
Indication status applies. If it is not the case, the on -board shall immediately set the 

--- Document Chunk 8835 ---
supervision status to the relevant value, applying a transition from the Indication status 

--- Document Chunk 8836 ---
according to clause 3.13.10.4.15. 

--- Document Chunk 8837 ---
3.13.10.4.17 The Normal status is not used in target speed monitoring. However, in case the 

--- Document Chunk 8838 ---
target speed monitoring is entered and the supervision statu s was  previously set to 

--- Document Chunk 8839 ---
Normal, the on-board equipment shall immediately execute one of the transition s from 

--- Document Chunk 8840 ---
the Normal status, as specified in clause 3.13.10.4.15. 

--- Document Chunk 8841 ---
3.13.10.4.18 Note: Depending upon train speed/position it is possible that for some target(s) 

--- Document Chunk 8842 ---
none of the tri ggering conditions specified in table 8 and 9 is met. However the 

--- Document Chunk 8843 ---
conditions to enter the target speed monitoring are such (see condition [1] in table 16) 

--- Document Chunk 8844 ---
that the clauses 3.13.10.4.16 and 3.13.10.4.17 always allow determining a supervision

3.13.10.5 Requirements for release speed monitoring

3.13.10.5.1 The on-board equipment shall display the Release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 8848 ---
3.13.10.5.2 The on-board equipment shall display the target distance in the same way as for target 

--- Document Chunk 8849 ---
speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.8 and 3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply. 

--- Document Chunk 8850 ---
3.13.10.5.3 The braking to target Permitted speed supervision limit related to the MRDT (i.e. EOA 

--- Document Chunk 8851 ---
or SvL), as calculated in target speed monitoring from the EBD or SBD, shall also be 

--- Document Chunk 8852 ---
displayed in the same way as for target speed monitoring, i.e. clauses 3.13.10.4.3 and 

--- Document Chunk 8853 ---
3.13.10.4.8.1 shall apply. 

--- Document Chunk 8854 ---
3.13.10.5.4 The on -board equipment shall compare the estimated speed with the release speed 

--- Document Chunk 8855 ---
and shall trigger/revoke commands to the train interface (emergency brake) and

--- Document Chunk 9236 ---
3.15.1.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 9237 ---
3.15.1.1.1 The RBC/RBC Handover principles are such that trains are able to pass from one RBC 

--- Document Chunk 9238 ---
area to another automatically (without driver action). 

--- Document Chunk 9239 ---
3.15.1.1.2 This is also granted when, due to a failure in the on -board radio commu nication 

--- Document Chunk 9240 ---
system, the on -board is no longer able to manage two communication sessions at 

--- Document Chunk 9241 ---
once. Thereby, the behaviour of the RBCs is independent from such on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9242 ---
degraded situation.

3.15.1.1.3 However, an RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one communication 

--- Document Chunk 9255 ---
session available may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to 

--- Document Chunk 9256 ---
“prepare” (session establishment, version determination, …) the expected supervision 

--- Document Chunk 9257 ---
by the Accepting RBC until the on-board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9258 ---
3.15.1.1.4 In level 3, trains following the one with only one communication session available will 

--- Document Chunk 9259 ---
always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from 

--- Document Chunk 9260 ---
the disconnection from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 9261 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9262 ---
3.15.1.2 Handing Over RBC 

--- Document Chunk 9263 ---
3.15.1.2.1 When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another 

--- Document Chunk 9264 ---
RBC area, it shall send: 

--- Document Chunk 9265 ---
a) Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 9266 ---
b) To the Accepting RBC the following information: 

--- Document Chunk 9267 ---
 The ETCS identity of the on-board equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 9268 ---
 The border lo cation that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 9269 ---
RBC area; 

--- Document Chunk 9270 ---
 Current mode of the on-board equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 9271 ---
 For a leading engine, Train Data and Train Running Number; 

--- Document Chunk 9272 ---
 The system versions supported by the on-board equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 9273 ---
 Optionally, for a non-leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 9274 ---
3.15.1.2.2 The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 9275 ---
concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding 

--- Document Chunk 9276 ---
information from the Accepting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9277 ---
3.15.1.2.3 It shall be possible for the Handing Over RBC to request route related information from

--- Document Chunk 9314 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9315 ---
3.15.1.2.6.1 Note: This information might be needed to inform the signalman of the Accepting

equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 9323 ---
3.15.1.2.9 When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to

the train identification). 

--- Document Chunk 9326 ---
3.15.1.2.9.1 Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:

3.15.1.3.2 Exception to 3.15.1.3.1 a) (degraded situation):  If the on-board equipment  is able to 

--- Document Chunk 9349 ---
handle only one communication session at a given time, it shall wait until the session 

--- Document Chunk 9350 ---
with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the border and then establish 

--- Document Chunk 9351 ---
the session with the Accepting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9352 ---
3.15.1.3.3 As soon as the on -board equipment has established the session with the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 9353 ---
RBC, it shall send its Train Data unless it is in sleeping or non leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 9354 ---
3.15.1.3.4 When the on -board equipment is connected to both RBCs, it shall send its position

Handing Over RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9357 ---
3.15.1.3.4.1 If the on -board equipment is connected to both RBCs, and it executes an End of

3.15.1.3.8.1 Note: Even after the train front end has passed the border, the on -board may have 

--- Document Chunk 9392 ---
to maintain the communication session with the Handing Over RBC (see 3.5.4) or re -

--- Document Chunk 9393 ---
establish it (see 3.5.3.4 f) ) and needs therefore to r emember the RBC ID/phone 

--- Document Chunk 9394 ---
number of this RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9395 ---
3.15.1.3.9 In case the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has reported that the train has passed 

--- Document Chunk 9396 ---
with its min safe rear end the announced border and no order to terminate the session 

--- Document Chunk 9397 ---
is received from the Handing Over RBC within  a fixed waiting time (see Appendix 

--- Document Chunk 9398 ---
A.3.1) from the time the position report was sent, it shall repeatedly send a position 

--- Document Chunk 9399 ---
report with the fixed waiting time after each repetition, until the order to terminate the 

--- Document Chunk 9400 ---
session is received, or the defined number  of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has 

--- Document Chunk 9401 ---
been reached. If no reply is received within the fixed waiting time after the last 

--- Document Chunk 9402 ---
repetition, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall terminate the communication 

--- Document Chunk 9403 ---
session with the Handing Over RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9404 ---
3.15.1.4 Accepting RBC 

--- Document Chunk 9405 ---
3.15.1.4.1 The Accepting RBC shall keep route related information sent to the Handing Over RBC 

--- Document Chunk 9406 ---
updated. In particular, this possibly includes temporary speed restrictions. 

--- Document Chunk 9407 ---
3.15.1.4.2 As soon as the Accepting RBC receives from the on -board equipment a position report 

--- Document Chunk 9408 ---
and detects that the maximum safe front end of the train has passed the border, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 9409 ---
inform the Handing Over RBC that it has taken over the responsibility. 

--- Document Chunk 9410 ---
3.15.1.4.3 When the Accepting RBC receives Train Data from both the on -board equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 9411 ---
the Handing over RBC Train Dat a provided by the on -board equipment shall take 

--- Document Chunk 9412 ---
precedence. 

--- Document Chunk 9413 ---
3.15.1.4.4 If the Accepting RBC receives a cancellation information from the Handing Over RBC, 

--- Document Chunk 9414 ---
it shall send an order to terminate the communication session to the corresponding on -

--- Document Chunk 9415 ---
board equipment (if already established). 

--- Document Chunk 9416 ---
3.15.1.4.5 The Accepting RBC shall comply with the maximum amount of data contained in the

acknowledgement is received, the receiving RBC shall send an acknowledgement to 

--- Document Chunk 9421 ---
the emitting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9422 ---
3.15.1.5.2 The RBC/RBC message is consistent when all checks have been completed 

--- Document Chunk 9423 ---

3.15.2 Handling of Trains with Non Leading Engines 

--- Document Chunk 9441 ---
3.15.2.1 It is possible to operate a train using more than one engine, each engine being under 

--- Document Chunk 9442 ---
the control of a driver. 

--- Document Chunk 9443 ---
3.15.2.2 Only the leading engine is responsible for the train movement supervision functions. 

--- Document Chunk 9444 ---
3.15.3 Splitting/joining 

--- Document Chunk 9445 ---
3.15.3.1 ERTMS/ETCS allow s Splitting and Joining using the  normal supervision functions 

--- Document Chunk 9446 ---
available (e.g. On-sight, Shunting). 

--- Document Chunk 9447 ---
3.15.3.2 Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one 

--- Document Chunk 9448 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment each. 

--- Document Chunk 9449 ---
3.15.3.2.1 Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 9450 ---
3.15.3.3 ERTMS/ETCS is not responsible for providing information that a Splitting/Joining 

--- Document Chunk 9451 ---
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect). 

--- Document Chunk 9452 ---
3.15.3.4 Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining 

--- Document Chunk 9453 ---
requires the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation has 

--- Document Chunk 9454 ---
been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection). 

--- Document Chunk 9455 ---
3.15.4 Reversing of movement direction 

--- Document Chunk 9456 ---
3.15.4.1 It shall be possible to send in advance to an on -board equipment information about 

--- Document Chunk 9457 ---
areas, where initiation of reversing of movement direction is possible, i.e. change the 

--- Document Chunk 9458 ---
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 9459 ---
3.15.4.1.1 A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available 

--- Document Chunk 9460 ---
on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 9461 ---
3.15.4.2 Together with  start and end of reversing area, the following supervision information 

--- Document Chunk 9462 ---
shall be sent: 

--- Document Chunk 9463 ---
a) Maximum distance to run in the direction opposite to the orientation of the reversing 

--- Document Chunk 9464 ---
area, the fixed reference location being the end location of the area where reversing 

--- Document Chunk 9465 ---
of movement is permitted with which the maximum distance information is sent. 

--- Document Chunk 9466 ---
b) Reversing mode speed limit allowed during reverse movement.

request to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 9555 ---
b) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop to display the 

--- Document Chunk 9556 ---

--- Document Chunk 9557 ---
3.15.5.3 As long as it is displayed, the driver has the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead 

--- Document Chunk 9558 ---
free request (meaning the driver confirms that the track between the head of the train 

--- Document Chunk 9559 ---
and the next signal or board marking signal position is free). 

--- Document Chunk 9560 ---
3.15.5.4 When t he driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop 

--- Document Chunk 9561 ---

3.15.7 Tolerance of Big Metal Mass 

--- Document Chunk 9590 ---
3.15.7.1 Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as defined in 

--- Document Chunk 9591 ---
Subset-036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm reporting 

--- Document Chunk 9592 ---
a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function. 

--- Document Chunk 9593 ---
3.15.7.2 In Levels 0/NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 

--- Document Chunk 9594 ---
for a defined distance (see A .3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the 

--- Document Chunk 9595 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction. 

--- Document Chunk 9596 ---
3.15.7.3 Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all 

--- Document Chunk 9597 ---
excessive big metal masses with track condition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted 

--- Document Chunk 9598 ---
areas. 

--- Document Chunk 9599 ---
3.15.8 Cold Movement Detection 

--- Document Chunk 9600 ---
3.15.8.1 After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9601 ---
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has 

--- Document Chunk 9602 ---
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours. 

--- Document Chunk 9603 ---
3.15.8.2 When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, if 

--- Document Chunk 9604 ---
available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the 

--- Document Chunk 9605 ---
status of information stored by on -board equipment (see chapter 4 section 4.11 for 

--- Document Chunk 9606 ---
details). 

--- Document Chunk 9607 ---
3.15.8.3 Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as 

--- Document Chunk 9608 ---
not available if: 

--- Document Chunk 9609 ---
a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 9610 ---
board equipment, OR 

--- Document Chunk 9611 ---
b) the Cold Movement Detection function has encountered a condition, during the No 

--- Document Chunk 9612 ---
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement informatio n (e.g. the 

--- Document Chunk 9613 ---

3.15.9 Virtual Balise Cover 

--- Document Chunk 9627 ---
3.15.9.1 It shall be possible to se t and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC). A VBC 

--- Document Chunk 9628 ---
is defined by: 

--- Document Chunk 9629 ---
a) A marker corresponding to  balises to be ignored by the on -board together with the 

--- Document Chunk 9630 ---
area (country or region) in which the VBC is applicable. The VBC marker and the 

--- Document Chunk 9631 ---
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity. 

--- Document Chunk 9632 ---
b) Its validity period. 

--- Document Chunk 9633 ---
3.15.9.2 During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to 

--- Document Chunk 9634 ---
remove an existing one. 

--- Document Chunk 9635 ---
3.15.9.3 As long as a VBC is stored on-board: 

--- Document Chunk 9636 ---
a) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ignore any balise telegram that 

--- Document Chunk 9637 ---
includes a VBC marker  and a country/region identity that both match the VBC 

--- Document Chunk 9638 ---
identity. 

--- Document Chunk 9639 ---
b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise 

--- Document Chunk 9640 ---
telegram occur. 

--- Document Chunk 9641 ---
3.15.9.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives from balise or from driver a new 

--- Document Chunk 9642 ---
VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC sha ll replace 

--- Document Chunk 9643 ---
the previous one, including its validity period. 

--- Document Chunk 9644 ---
3.15.9.5 A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on -board equipment is switched off (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 9645 ---
enters No Power mode)  and shall remai n applicable when powered on  again. It shall 

--- Document Chunk 9646 ---
be deleted when: 

--- Document Chunk 9647 ---
a) it is ordered by trackside, or 

--- Document Chunk 9648 ---
b) its validity period has elapsed, or 

--- Document Chunk 9649 ---
c) it is removed by the driver (during Start of Mission), or 

--- Document Chunk 9650 ---
d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 9651 ---
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Not e: this means that the reception of a 

--- Document Chunk 9652 ---
consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting a VBC due to 

--- Document Chunk 9653 ---
mismatching country/region identities. 

--- Document Chunk 9654 ---
3.15.10 Advance display of route related information 

--- Document Chunk 9655 ---
3.15.10.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display an overview of th e gradient 

--- Document Chunk 9656 ---
profile (as received from trackside), of the MRSP, of the track conditions  (except the 

--- Document Chunk 9657 ---
tunnel stopping areas) , of the first I ndication location , if any (only in Ceiling Speed

3.16 Data Consistency 

--- Document Chunk 9681 ---
3.16.1 Criteria of consistency 

--- Document Chunk 9682 ---
3.16.1.1 The on-board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the 

--- Document Chunk 9683 ---
following criteria is not fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 9684 ---
a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and 

--- Document Chunk 9685 ---
respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid values  

--- Document Chunk 9686 ---
b) The message shall be received in due time. 

--- Document Chunk 9687 ---
c) The message shall be received at the right expected location. 

--- Document Chunk 9688 ---
3.16.1.1.1 Regarding a): a value of a variable is invalid when a spare value is used. 

--- Document Chunk 9689 ---
3.16.2 Balises 

--- Document Chunk 9690 ---
3.16.2.1 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 9691 ---
3.16.2.1.1 The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram. 

--- Document Chunk 9692 ---
3.16.2.1.2 The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a balise 

--- Document Chunk 9693 ---
group is called a balise group message.  

--- Document Chunk 9694 ---
3.16.2.1.2.1 Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message 

--- Document Chunk 9695 ---
coincide.

3.16.2.2.1 If the on-board is not able to recognise whether a balise group is linked or unlinked (if 

--- Document Chunk 9699 ---
none of the balises in the balise group can be read correctly), it shall consider it as 

--- Document Chunk 9700 ---
unlinked.

to correctly evaluate the d uplicating one, the duplicating one shall be used as location 

--- Document Chunk 9735 ---
reference instead. 

--- Document Chunk 9736 ---
3.16.2.3.4 If the balise duplicating the location reference balise is used as location reference for

the duplicating one is correctly read and contains: 

--- Document Chunk 9854 ---
 directional information while the orientation of the balise group can still be

--- Document Chunk 9898 ---
3.16.2.7.2.1 If repositioning is an nounced and the expected repositioning balise group has been 

--- Document Chunk 9899 ---
found, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall keep looking for a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 9900 ---
that satisfies the same criteria as this previously expected and already found 

--- Document Chunk 9901 ---
repositioning balise group, until one of the following events occurs: 

--- Document Chunk 9902 ---
a) the on -board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise 

--- Document Chunk 9903 ---
group that was announced and already found 

--- Document Chunk 9904 ---
b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is found. 

--- Document Chunk 9905 ---
3.16.2.7.2.2 If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously 

--- Document Chunk 9906 ---
expected and already found repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9907 ---
equipment shall command the service brake  and the driver shall be informed . At 

--- Document Chunk 9908 ---
standstill, the location based informa tion stored on -board shall be shortened to the 

--- Document Chunk 9909 ---
current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which 

--- Document Chunk 9910 ---

--- Document Chunk 9911 ---
3.16.2.7.2.3 Note: this function is independent from linking function, i.e. the rules related to 

--- Document Chunk 9912 ---
linking always ap ply. This means that once a repositioning balise group has been 

--- Document Chunk 9913 ---
found and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9914 ---
equipment will start expecting the first balise group announced in this new linking

3.16.3.1 General issues 

--- Document Chunk 9918 ---
3.16.3.1.1 A radio message is consistent when all checks have been completed successfully: 

--- Document Chunk 9919 ---
a) Checks performed by Euroradio protocol have been passed (see Subset-037) 

--- Document Chunk 9920 ---
b) Time stamps checks have been passed (see 3.16.3.3.3) 

--- Document Chunk 9921 ---
c) Variables in the messages do not have in-valid values. 

--- Document Chunk 9922 ---
3.16.3.1.1.1 The on-board shall reject a message transmitted from the trackside if the message 

--- Document Chunk 9923 ---
is not consistent. 

--- Document Chunk 9924 ---
3.16.3.1.1.2 The on-board shall inform the trackside if a not consistent message is received. 

--- Document Chunk 9925 ---
3.16.3.1.2 Emergency messages shall be transmitted either as high priority data or as normal 

--- Document Chunk 9926 ---
priority data. 

--- Document Chunk 9927 ---
3.16.3.1.3 Other messages shall be sent as normal priority data. 

--- Document Chunk 9928 ---
3.16.3.1.3.1 Messages shall only be accepted when received with the data priority for which they 

--- Document Chunk 9929 ---
are specified. 

--- Document Chunk 9930 ---
3.16.3.1.4 The chap ters 3.16.3.2 to 3.16.3.5 define data consistency principles and 

--- Document Chunk 9931 ---
corresponding checks for data transmitted as normal priority data.  

--- Document Chunk 9932 ---
For high priority data, the checks shall not apply.

3.16.3.2 Time stamping 

--- Document Chunk 9945 ---
3.16.3.2.1 The trackside shall always transmit its information with reference to the train time. 

--- Document Chunk 9946 ---
3.16.3.2.2 To time -stamp its messages, the trackside shall make a safe estimation of the on -

--- Document Chunk 9947 ---
board time, based on the time -stamp of the received messages and the internal 

--- Document Chunk 9948 ---
processing times. The estimation shall be made in such a way that the  on-board time 

--- Document Chunk 9949 ---
estimated by the trackside shall not be in advance of the real on-board time. 

--- Document Chunk 9950 ---
3.16.3.2.3 Wrap around of the onboard timer can occur during a communication session and 

--- Document Chunk 9951 ---
shall have no impact on system behaviour.

3.16.3.3 Supervision of Sequence 

--- Document Chunk 9953 ---
3.16.3.3.1 The trackside shall  time-stamp a message with a value corresponding to the time of 

--- Document Chunk 9954 ---
sending. 

--- Document Chunk 9955 ---
3.16.3.3.2 There shall always be a time stamp increment between consecutive messages. 

--- Document Chunk 9956 ---
3.16.3.3.3 If the time stamp of the last received message is lower than or equal to the former one 

--- Document Chunk 9957 ---
its content shall not be used. 

--- Document Chunk 9958 ---
3.16.3.3.3.1 Only time stamps of messages received as normal priority data shall be used. 

--- Document Chunk 9959 ---
3.16.3.3.3.2 Note: The supervision does not detect a lost message. This has to be assured by

--- Document Chunk 10092 ---
ERTMS/ETCS system version numbers X included in the e nvelope of legally operated 

--- Document Chunk 10093 ---
system versions, as defined in chapter 6. 

--- Document Chunk 10094 ---
3.17.2.1.1 Within one of its supported system version numbers X, the on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 10095 ---
always operate the highest system version number Y defined in this release of the 

--- Document Chunk 10096 ---
SRS, regardless of the system version number Y transmitted by the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 10097 ---
3.17.2.2 The on-board equipment shall operate with only one system version at a time, i.e. it 

--- Document Chunk 10098 ---
shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version 

--- Document Chunk 10099 ---
(refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one 

--- Document Chunk 10100 ---
introduced in this release of the SRS). 

--- Document Chunk 10101 ---
3.17.2.3 The on -board equipment shall determine the operated system version  number X , in 

--- Document Chunk 10102 ---
relation to non -RBC trackside constituents, as the system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 10103 ---
transmitted by any balise, loop or RIU, if this system version number X is higher than 

--- Document Chunk 10104 ---
the currently operated one. 

--- Document Chunk 10105 ---
3.17.2.4 It shall be possible from balise group to order the on -board equipment to operate a 

--- Document Chunk 10106 ---
system version. 

--- Document Chunk 10107 ---
3.17.2.5 On receiving the order to operate system versio n from balise group, the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 10108 ---
equipment shall immediately operate the system version number X given in the order. 

--- Document Chunk 10109 ---
After the order is executed, the requirement 3.17.2.3 shall be again applied for any 

--- Document Chunk 10110 ---
further received balise telegram/loop message or any further contacted RIU.

--- Document Chunk 10263 ---
3.18.2.2 Trains shall be supervised according to the National Values of the current 

--- Document Chunk 10264 ---
infrastructure if they are available on-board.  

--- Document Chunk 10265 ---
3.18.2.3 National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are 

--- Document Chunk 10266 ---
applicable. They shall become applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable 

--- Document Chunk 10267 ---
immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 10268 ---
3.18.2.4 Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the 

--- Document Chunk 10269 ---
country or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used. 

--- Document Chunk 10270 ---
3.18.2.5 For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back 

--- Document Chunk 10271 ---
value if: 

--- Document Chunk 10272 ---
 the National Value  is not available, or  

--- Document Chunk 10273 ---
 a mismatch has been detected between the cou ntry or region identifier read from a 

--- Document Chunk 10274 ---
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set with which the 

--- Document Chunk 10275 ---
National Value was received and stored. 

--- Document Chunk 10276 ---
3.18.2.6 Note: even though the National Values are always transmitted as a single  set for a 

--- Document Chunk 10277 ---
given sys tem version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that 

--- Document Chunk 10278 ---
when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a 

--- Document Chunk 10279 ---
balise group, the on -board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of 

--- Document Chunk 10280 ---
National Values 

--- Document Chunk 10281 ---
3.18.2.7 The National Values currently applicable when the on-board equipment is switched off 

--- Document Chunk 10282 ---
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain applicable when 

--- Document Chunk 10283 ---
powered on. 

--- Document Chunk 10284 ---
3.18.2.7.1 Justification:  The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 10285 ---
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been 

--- Document Chunk 10286 ---
received on-board, there is no need to re -load the information unless National Values 

--- Document Chunk 10287 ---
change, the on -board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train 

--- Document Chunk 10288 ---
enters an area requiring different National Values. 

--- Document Chunk 10289 ---
3.18.2.8 The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on 

--- Document Chunk 10290 ---
transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values. 

--- Document Chunk 10291 ---
3.18.2.8.1 When a new set of National Values becomes applicable its content  shall always 

--- Document Chunk 10292 ---
overwrite the corresponding National Values  currently applicable regardless of the 

--- Document Chunk 10293 ---
country or region identifier(s). 

--- Document Chunk 10294 ---
3.18.2.9 A previously received set of National Values which is not yet applicable shall be 

--- Document Chunk 10295 ---
deleted if: 

--- Document Chunk 10296 ---
 a new set of National Values is received, or 

--- Document Chunk 10297 ---
 the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power 

--- Document Chunk 10298 ---
mode). 

--- Document Chunk 10299 ---
3.18.2.10 If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected between the 

--- Document Chunk 10300 ---
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corres ponding identifier(s)

3.18.4.3.1.1 Note: If a valid RBC identity and telephone number is available on -board, no driver 

--- Document Chunk 10447 ---
data entry is needed to establish a connection to the RBC when performing a start of 

--- Document Chunk 10448 ---
mission or after a manual level change to level 2/3. 

--- Document Chunk 10449 ---
3.18.4.3.2 In level 2/3 only, at standstill, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall offer the 

--- Document Chunk 10450 ---
driver different means  to select the RBC contact information (RBC identity and 

--- Document Chunk 10451 ---
telephone number to be used), for details see step S3, section 5.4, Start of Mission

--- Document Chunk 10456 ---
equipment shall store as valid RBC i dentity and telephone number, the RBC identity 

--- Document Chunk 10457 ---
reported by EURORADIO and the EIRENE short number, respectively. 

--- Document Chunk 10458 ---
3.18.4.3.4.1 Note: If the short number is re -used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment (e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 10459 ---
following a loss of safe radio connection) and does not direct t o a RBC with the stored 

--- Document Chunk 10460 ---
RBC ID, the connection will be terminated (EURORADIO functionality). 

--- Document Chunk 10461 ---
3.18.4.3.5 The unit, range and resolution of the RBC identity and telephone number shall be as 

--- Document Chunk 10462 ---

3.18.4.4 ETCS Identity 

--- Document Chunk 10466 ---
3.18.4.4.1 The ETCS identity of an on -board equipment is made of a single identity number. The 

--- Document Chunk 10467 ---
ETCS identity of an RBC, balise group, loop or RIU is composed of a country/region 

--- Document Chunk 10468 ---
identity number and of an identity number within the country/region. 

--- Document Chunk 10469 ---
3.18.4.4.2 All on-board equipments in service, balise groups marked as linked, RBC’s, RIU’s, and 

--- Document Chunk 10470 ---
loops shall be assigned a unique ETCS identity within their respective group. 

--- Document Chunk 10471 ---
3.18.4.4.3 The assignment of (unique or not)  ETCS identities to balise groups marked as 

--- Document Chunk 10472 ---
unlinked is the sole responsibility of the entity in charge of the assignment of values 

--- Document Chunk 10473 ---
(see SUBSET-054), depending on the specific trackside implementation. 

--- Document Chunk 10474 ---
3.18.4.5 Train Running Number 

--- Document Chunk 10475 ---
3.18.4.5.1 During the Start of Mission, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a leading engine 

--- Document Chunk 10476 ---
shall acquire the train running number from driver input, from the RBC or from other 

--- Document Chunk 10477 ---
ERTMS/ETCS external sources. 

--- Document Chunk 10478 ---
3.18.4.5.2 It shall be possible to enter train running number also in a non-leading engine.

A.3.3 Handling of information received from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 10772 ---
A.3.3.1  Before it can be accepted and  used by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment, raw 

--- Document Chunk 10773 ---
information received from trackside is subject to various checks, which can lead to the 

--- Document Chunk 10774 ---
individual rejection/ignoring of information (e.g. Movement Authority not valid for the 

--- Document Chunk 10775 ---
train orientation), the ignoring  of a whole balise telegram or the rejection of a whole 

--- Document Chunk 10776 ---
message. The SRS clauses/sections corresponding to these checks are gathered in

--- Document Chunk 10841 ---
A.3.3.3 Example 1: clause 3.16.2.4.9 has to be understood as follows: “If a <consistent>

“default balise information” <which is valid for the train orientation (or the balise group 

--- Document Chunk 10847 ---

Situations 

--- Document Chunk 10877 ---
A.3.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 10878 ---
A.3.4.1.1 All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special 

--- Document Chunk 10879 ---
situations. 

--- Document Chunk 10880 ---
A.3.4.1.2 The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are: 

--- Document Chunk 10881 ---
a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10882 ---
b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4); 

--- Document Chunk 10883 ---
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10884 ---
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time -out 

--- Document Chunk 10885 ---
(3.8.4.4.2) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10886 ---
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10887 ---
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10888 ---
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train  is at standstill 

--- Document Chunk 10889 ---
(3.16.2.5.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10890 ---
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10891 ---
i) the reaction due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service 

--- Document Chunk 10892 ---
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10893 ---
j) the train category, axle load  category, loading gauge or traction system is changed 

--- Document Chunk 10894 ---
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10895 ---
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ; 

--- Document Chunk 10896 ---
l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at 

--- Document Chunk 10897 ---
standstill (3.16.2.7)

A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations 

--- Document Chunk 11120 ---
A.3.5.1 Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside, 

--- Document Chunk 11121 ---
the on -board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither 

--- Document Chunk 11122 ---
reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse 

--- Document Chunk 11123 ---
movement (initiated by driver or due to roll -away) and the sub -sequent forward 

--- Document Chunk 11124 ---
movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG . This rule shall 

--- Document Chunk 11125 ---
apply to the following actions: 

--- Document Chunk 11126 ---
 Change of National Values (see 3.18.2) 

--- Document Chunk 11127 ---
 Request to acknowledge new level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10) 

--- Document Chunk 11128 ---
 Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3) 

--- Document Chunk 11129 ---
 Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode tran sition due to mode profile (see 

--- Document Chunk 11130 ---
3.12.4) 

--- Document Chunk 11131 ---
 Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3) 

--- Document Chunk 11132 ---
 Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1) 

--- Document Chunk 11133 ---
 Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big 

--- Document Chunk 11134 ---
metal masses and non stopping areas 

--- Document Chunk 11135 ---
 Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4) 

--- Document Chunk 11136 ---
 Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5) 

--- Document Chunk 11137 ---
 Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6) 

--- Document Chunk 11138 ---
 Substitute the supervision of  the LX start location as the EOA/SvL by the inclusion 

--- Document Chunk 11139 ---
of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP (see 5.16.2 and 5.16.3) 

--- Document Chunk 11140 ---
A.3.5.2 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has received a balise group message 

--- Document Chunk 11141 ---
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of  the balise group), the action(s) 

--- Document Chunk 11142 ---
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time 

--- Document Chunk 11143 ---
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related 

--- Document Chunk 11144 ---
to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed. 

--- Document Chunk 11145 ---
A.3.5.2.1 Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, 

--- Document Chunk 11146 ---
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the 

--- Document Chunk 11147 ---
EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the 

--- Document Chunk 11148 ---
replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on -board as happening before the 

--- Document Chunk 11149 ---
min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 

--- Document Chunk 11150 ---
3.13.10.2.7 applies). 

--- Document Chunk 11151 ---
A.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA /LOA 

--- Document Chunk 11152 ---
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when 

--- Document Chunk 11153 ---
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA /LOA) has been processed, will not

lead to the end of the overrid e procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. 

--- Document Chunk 11166 ---
In other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA /LOA and the end of override 

--- Document Chunk 11167 ---
procedure (see 5.8. 3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on -board as 

--- Document Chunk 11168 ---
simultaneously happening before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA 

--- Document Chunk 11169 ---
location. 

--- Document Chunk 11170 ---
A.3.6 Deletion of accepted and stored information when used 

--- Document Chunk 11171 ---
A.3.6.1 Standard case 

--- Document Chunk 11172 ---
A.3.6.1.1 When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied 

--- Document Chunk 11173 ---
by trackside information  no longer used, i.e., the related on -board functionality has 

--- Document Chunk 11174 ---
been completed, shall be made available immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 11175 ---
A.3.6.1.1.1 Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity 

--- Document Chunk 11176 ---
available on -board in order to comply with dim ensioning rules regards information 

--- Document Chunk 11177 ---
stored on-board given in Subset 040. 

--- Document Chunk 11178 ---
A.3.6.2 Exception 

--- Document Chunk 11179 ---
A.3.6.2.1 Following information shall remain stored on -board for a distance defined by a fixed 

--- Document Chunk 11180 ---
value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train: 

--- Document Chunk 11181 ---
 location dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR 

--- Document Chunk 11182 ---
(see 3.11.2.2) 

--- Document Chunk 11183 ---
 gradient information, 

--- Document Chunk 11184 ---
 reduced adhesion information received from trackside, 

--- Document Chunk 11185 ---
 Track condition “Big metal masses”. 

--- Document Chunk 11186 ---
A.3.6.2.1.1 Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement: 

--- Document Chunk 11187 ---
 With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”,  the stored 

--- Document Chunk 11188 ---
information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to calculate speed 

--- Document Chunk 11189 ---
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver)  

--- Document Chunk 11190 ---
 Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to 

--- Document Chunk 11191 ---
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track. 

--- Document Chunk 11192 ---
A.3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is 

--- Document Chunk 11193 ---
determined by a National/Default value.  This is also true for a reverse movement in 

--- Document Chunk 11194 ---
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 11195 ---
In order to keep the on -board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chose n 

--- Document Chunk 11196 ---
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is 

--- Document Chunk 11197 ---
no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is made available again.

A.3.7  Calculation of the basic deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 11210 ---
A.3.7.1 The brake percentage (λ) shall be converted into two different input parameters: 

--- Document Chunk 11211 ---
λo = λ for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V)) 

--- Document Chunk 11212 ---
λo = MIN (λ, 135) for calculation of service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 

--- Document Chunk 11213 ---
where λ is the brake percentage defined as part of Train Data. 

--- Document Chunk 11214 ---
A.3.7.2 The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm 

--- Document Chunk 11215 ---
that will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake. 

--- Document Chunk 11216 ---
A.3.7.3 The speed limit for the first step shall be calculated as V_lim = x * λoy. 

--- Document Chunk 11217 ---
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h 

--- Document Chunk 11218 ---
x = 16.85 

--- Document Chunk 11219 ---
y = 0.428 

--- Document Chunk 11220 ---
A.3.7.4 The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as AD_0 = A * λo + B

AD_0 is the basic deceleration in m/s2 for 0 ≤ speed ≤ V_lim. 

--- Document Chunk 11222 ---
A = 0.0075 

--- Document Chunk 11223 ---
B = 0.076 

--- Document Chunk 11224 ---
A.3.7.5 The following steps of the basic deceleration shall be calculated by means of a set of 

--- Document Chunk 11225 ---
polynomials of the third order with the following format: 

--- Document Chunk 11226 ---
AD_n = a3_n * λo3 + a2_n * λo2 + a1_n * λo + a0_n 

--- Document Chunk 11227 ---
and with the following values for n (all speed limits in km/h): 

--- Document Chunk 11228 ---
n = 1   valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 100  if V_lim < 100 

--- Document Chunk 11229 ---
to be ignored      if V_lim ≥ 100

n = 3   valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 150  if 120 < V_lim < 150 

--- Document Chunk 11234 ---
valid for 120 < speed ≤ 150   if V_lim ≤ 120 

--- Document Chunk 11235 ---
to be ignored      if V_lim ≥ 150 

--- Document Chunk 11236 ---
n = 4   valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 180  if 150 < V_lim < 180 

--- Document Chunk 11237 ---

--- Document Chunk 11369 ---
reference value s for the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake , which 

--- Document Chunk 11370 ---
shall be considered as maximum one s. If justified by the specific brake system of the 

--- Document Chunk 11371 ---
train other values of these coefficients, which lead to shorter value s of the equivalent 

--- Document Chunk 11372 ---
brake build up time for the service brake, may be used.

A.3.9.7 Note: Although certain trains may perform better, the reference values for the

appropriate basis for infrastructure planning.

A.3.10 Service brake feedback 

--- Document Chunk 11377 ---
A.3.10.1 The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and 

--- Document Chunk 11378 ---
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves. 

--- Document Chunk 11379 ---
A.3.10.2 The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if: 

--- Document Chunk 11380 ---
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND 

--- Document Chunk 11381 ---
b) The national value does not inhibit its use.

A.3.10.3 Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe 

--- Document Chunk 11394 ---
pressure and brake cylinder p ressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake 

--- Document Chunk 11395 ---
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted 

--- Document Chunk 11396 ---
into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way: 

--- Document Chunk 11397 ---
p = fictive main brake pipe pressure (kPa) 

--- Document Chunk 11398 ---
p_cylinder = brake cylinder pressure (kPa) 

--- Document Chunk 11399 ---
k1 = vehicle dependent constant (set by engineering of ETCS on -board; k1 is normally 

--- Document Chunk 11400 ---
between 2.0 and 2.7) 

--- Document Chunk 11401 ---
p =  500  - p_cylinder / k1 

--- Document Chunk 11402 ---
A.3.10.4 The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algori thm 

--- Document Chunk 11403 ---
to take the service brake feedback into account: 

--- Document Chunk 11404 ---
p = current main brake pipe pressure (or fictive main brake pipe pressure calculated in  

--- Document Chunk 11405 ---
A.3.10.3) 

--- Document Chunk 11406 ---
p0 = reference pressure when not braking  

--- Document Chunk 11407 ---
p1 = pressure at which the train starts to brake = p0 - 30  

--- Document Chunk 11408 ---
p2 = pressure limit, under which T_bs1 and T_bs2 are locked = p0 - 60  

--- Document Chunk 11409 ---
p3 = pressure at full service brake = p0 - 150  

--- Document Chunk 11410 ---
Q_feedback_active = a Boolean stating whe ther the feedback function is active, i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 11411 ---
once it has started to reduce T_bs1 and T_bs2  until the ceiling speed monitoring is 

--- Document Chunk 11412 ---
entered. 

--- Document Chunk 11413 ---
Q_Tbslocked = a boolean stating whe ther T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to the 

--- Document Chunk 11414 ---
following values due to enough main brake pipe pressure reduction: 

--- Document Chunk 11415 ---
T_bs1_locked =  0 s. 

--- Document Chunk 11416 ---
T_bs2_locked =  2 s. 

--- Document Chunk 11417 ---
Q_displaylocked_P = a boolean stating whether the displayed permitted speed  is 

--- Document Chunk 11418 ---
locked due to SB feedback. 

--- Document Chunk 11419 ---
Q_displaylocked_SBI = a boolean stating whether th e displayed SBI  speed (if any) is 

--- Document Chunk 11420 ---
locked due to SB feedback. 

--- Document Chunk 11421 ---
Q_displaylocked_TD = a boolean stating whether the displayed target  distance is 

--- Document Chunk 11422 ---
locked due to SB feedback. 

--- Document Chunk 11423 ---
A displayed value is locked from the moment the SB feedback has started to reduce 

--- Document Chunk 11424 ---
T_bs1 and T_bs2 until the calculated value becomes less than the displayed and 

--- Document Chunk 11425 ---
locked value. Note: It is only SB feedback that can start  the locking of the displayed 

--- Document Chunk 11426 ---
values. Once started and still locked it remains locked also in case the calculated 

--- Document Chunk 11427 ---
values are increased due to other reasons (e.g. due to relocation), which will prolong

The reference pressure p0 (nominal value 500 kPa) shall be set on starting the ETCS:  

--- Document Chunk 11546 ---
 a) To the first stable p value between 400-550 kPa achieved.  

--- Document Chunk 11547 ---
 b) Stable in this instance means that the pressure has not varied more  than ± 

--- Document Chunk 11548 ---
20 kPa over 3 seconds. 

--- Document Chunk 11549 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11550 ---
 The reference pressure p0 shall thereafter be adapted to the current pressure 

--- Document Chunk 11551 ---
according to the following table (which applies if the calculation is performed once per 

--- Document Chunk 11552 ---
second): 

--- Document Chunk 11553 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11554 ---
 CONDITIONS: ACTION: REMARKS 

--- Document Chunk 11555 ---
a) p = p0 No change Constant pressure 

--- Document Chunk 11556 ---
b) p > p0 p0 = p0 + 1,5 Increasing pressure 

--- Document Chunk 11557 ---
c) p < p0 - 30 No change Braking 

--- Document Chunk 11558 ---
d) p0 > p > p0 - 30 p0 = p0  0,5 Decreasing pressure

--- Document Chunk 11561 ---
- p is limited to max 550 kPa. 

--- Document Chunk 11562 ---
- Values given in kPa. 

--- Document Chunk 11563 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11564 ---
A.3.10.5 Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 h ave been locked to 0s and 2 s  on approaching a non zero 

--- Document Chunk 11565 ---
target, the locking will remain even if the train speed comes below the target speed. 

--- Document Chunk 11566 ---
This avoids “jumping” indications  related to the values of T_bs1 and T_bs2 . It also 

--- Document Chunk 11567 ---
makes it possible to release t he brakes before a speed reduction, without having the 

--- Document Chunk 11568 ---
curves moving back again. It might though result in emergency brake intervention if the 

--- Document Chunk 11569 ---
driver releases the brakes too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety 

--- Document Chunk 11570 ---
issue. To keep 2 s between  the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated 

--- Document Chunk 11571 ---
first and thus may avoid emergency brake. 

--- Document Chunk 11572 ---
A.3.10.6 Note: If feedback is active but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback function 

--- Document Chunk 11573 ---
will remain active until the ceiling speed monitoring is ent ered. This avoids “jumping”

4.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 12012 ---
4.4.1.1 For each mode the following information is given: 

--- Document Chunk 12013 ---
a) The context of utilisation of the mode and the functions that characterise the mode 

--- Document Chunk 12014 ---
(chapter “Description”).  

--- Document Chunk 12015 ---
b) The ERTMS/ETCS levels in whic h the mode can be used (chapter “Used in 

--- Document Chunk 12016 ---
levels”). 

--- Document Chunk 12017 ---
c) The related responsibility of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and of the 

--- Document Chunk 12018 ---
driver, once the equipment is in this mode (chapter “Responsibilities”). 

--- Document Chunk 12019 ---
4.4.1.2 A complete list of transitions to and from each mode is g iven in the section 4.6.2

4.4.6 SLEEPING 

--- Document Chunk 12123 ---
4.4.6.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12124 ---
4.4.6.1.1 The Sleeping mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of a 

--- Document Chunk 12125 ---
slave engine that is remote controlled. 

--- Document Chunk 12126 ---
4.4.6.1.2 The desk (s) of a sleeping engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no 

--- Document Chunk 12127 ---
information shall be shown). 

--- Document Chunk 12128 ---
4.4.6.1.3 As the engine is remote controlled by the leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS o n-board 

--- Document Chunk 12129 ---
equipment shall not perform any train movement supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 12130 ---
4.4.6.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 

--- Document Chunk 12131 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 12132 ---
train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 12133 ---
4.4.6.1.5 Sleeping mode shall be automatically detected on-board via the train interface. 

--- Document Chunk 12134 ---
4.4.6.1.6 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a sleeping 

--- Document Chunk 12135 ---
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the 

--- Document Chunk 12136 ---
occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves the 

--- Document Chunk 12137 ---
Sleeping mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould also try to send an 

--- Document Chunk 12138 ---
error information to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 12139 ---
4.4.6.1.7 If a desk of the sleeping engine is opened while the train is running (t his is an 

--- Document Chunk 12140 ---
abnormal operation), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to Stand -By 

--- Document Chunk 12141 ---
mode. 

--- Document Chunk 12142 ---
4.4.6.1.8 If the “sleeping input signal” is lost (no more detection of the remote control), the 

--- Document Chunk 12143 ---
switch to Stand-By mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 12144 ---
4.4.6.1.9 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 12145 ---
4.4.6.1.10 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall open a communication session with the

--- Document Chunk 12147 ---
a) in all levels, on receipt of the order to contact the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 12148 ---
b) In level 2/3, when entering or exiting Sle eping mode (to report the change of mode 

--- Document Chunk 12149 ---
to the RBC). 

--- Document Chunk 12150 ---
c) In level 2/3, when a safety critical fault of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 12151 ---
occurs (to report the fault to the RBC).

--- Document Chunk 12237 ---
4.4.8.1.5 When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage level 

--- Document Chunk 12238 ---
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level 

--- Document Chunk 12239 ---
transition order shall be stored and evaluated only when another mode than Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 12240 ---
or Passive Shunting has been entered  (i.e. when the Shunting movement is 

--- Document Chunk 12241 ---
terminated). 

--- Document Chunk 12242 ---
4.4.8.1.5.1 When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

4.4.11 STAFF RESPONSIBLE 

--- Document Chunk 12386 ---
4.4.11.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12387 ---
4.4.11.1.1 The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own 

--- Document Chunk 12388 ---
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area. 

--- Document Chunk 12389 ---
4.4.11.1.2 This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example: 

--- Document Chunk 12390 ---
a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment starts-up (awakening of the train). 

--- Document Chunk 12391 ---
b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 12392 ---
c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact). 

--- Document Chunk 12393 ---
4.4.11.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 12394 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit  

--- Document Chunk 12395 ---
b) a given distance (regarding its origin location see 4.4.11.1.3.1) . The ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 12396 ---
on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves with a target speed of zero to 

--- Document Chunk 12397 ---
the end of this distance. If the train overpasses this distance (see next no te) the 

--- Document Chunk 12398 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trip the train 

--- Document Chunk 12399 ---
c) a list of expected balise  groups, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train 

--- Document Chunk 12400 ---
shall be tripped if over -passing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an 

--- Document Chunk 12401 ---
empty list is sent, no balise gr oup can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise 

--- Document Chunk 12402 ---
groups can be passed) 

--- Document Chunk 12403 ---
d) balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the 

--- Document Chunk 12404 ---
train, unless the over -passed balise group is included in a list of expected balises 

--- Document Chunk 12405 ---
as defined in item c) 

--- Document Chunk 12406 ---
e) running in the direction opposite to the train orientation (reverse movement 

--- Document Chunk 12407 ---
protection) 

--- Document Chunk 12408 ---
4.4.11.1.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall determine the start location of the SR distance 

--- Document Chunk 12409 ---
as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 12410 ---
a) If the National/Default value determines the max permitted distanc e to run in SR 

--- Document Chunk 12411 ---
mode, the starting point of this distance shall refer to the estimated position of the 

--- Document Chunk 12412 ---
train front when SR mode was entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode, 

--- Document Chunk 12413 ---
when Override was activated. 

--- Document Chunk 12414 ---
b) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value 

--- Document Chunk 12415 ---
transmitted by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the start location of the distance 

--- Document Chunk 12416 ---
shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when the distance information 

--- Document Chunk 12417 ---
is received or entered. 

--- Document Chunk 12418 ---
c) If the max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value 

--- Document Chunk 12419 ---
transmitted by EUROLOOP, the distance information transmitted by EUROLOOP 

--- Document Chunk 12420 ---
shall be referred to one or more reference balise groups. On -board shall evaluate

In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the 

--- Document Chunk 12434 ---
distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information, 

--- Document Chunk 12435 ---
the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance

given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and 

--- Document Chunk 12437 ---
the LRBG. 

--- Document Chunk 12438 ---
4.4.11.1.4 Note: Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff

4.4.11.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify 

--- Document Chunk 12441 ---
the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible 

--- Document Chunk 12442 ---
only at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 12443 ---
4.4.11.1.5.1 If a train movement is detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance

--- Document Chunk 12449 ---
This triggers an MA request. 

--- Document Chunk 12450 ---
4.4.11.1.6.1 Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further. 

--- Document Chunk 12451 ---
4.4.11.1.6.2 When entering SR mode , the value applicable for SR mode speed limit and the 

--- Document Chunk 12452 ---
value applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default value s. 

--- Document Chunk 12453 ---
Exception for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance. 

--- Document Chunk 12454 ---
4.4.11.1.6.3 While in SR mode, t he value applicable for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if 

--- Document Chunk 12455 ---
available, the last value entered by the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 12456 ---
4.4.11.1.6.4 While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available, 

--- Document Chunk 12457 ---
the last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 12458 ---
a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver; 

--- Document Chunk 12459 ---
b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 12460 ---
4.4.11.1.6.5 When "Override" is selected, the SR mode speed limit value and the SR distance 

--- Document Chunk 12461 ---
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The

4.4.14.1.3 The train shall only be authorised to move backwards a given distance (national value). 

--- Document Chunk 12600 ---
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise this national distance for

reverse movements, and shall command the service brakes if the distance is over -

--- Document Chunk 12602 ---
passed. The driver shall be informed about the reason for the brake application. 

--- Document Chunk 12603 ---
4.4.14.1.3.1 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement 

--- Document Chunk 12604 ---
Protection (as in PT mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 

--- Document Chunk 12605 ---
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in PT 

--- Document Chunk 12606 ---
mode). This implies that the given distance to run backwards in PT is considered as a 

--- Document Chunk 12607 ---
directional data, oriented backwards. 

--- Document Chunk 12608 ---

--- Document Chunk 12653 ---
4.4.15.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12654 ---
4.4.15.1.1 The Non-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 12655 ---
of a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not 

--- Document Chunk 12656 ---
remote controlled) but has its own driver. 

--- Document Chunk 12657 ---
4.4.15.1.1.1 Note: This operating situation is called Tandem. 

--- Document Chunk 12658 ---
4.4.15.1.1.2 The ERT MS/ETCS on-board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to 

--- Document Chunk 12659 ---
enter in Non-Leading mode, a “non leading input signal" from the train interface. 

--- Document Chunk 12660 ---
4.4.15.1.1.3 If the “non leading input signal" is no longer present, the switch to Stand -By 

--- Document Chunk 12661 ---

the RBC, according to the previously received parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 12669 ---
4.4.15.1.5 If possible, the train must not be stopped d ue to a safety critical fault in a non -leading 

--- Document Chunk 12670 ---
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to memorise the 

--- Document Chunk 12671 ---
occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine leaves Non 

--- Document Chunk 12672 ---
Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould also try to send an

4.4.18 REVERSING 

--- Document Chunk 12760 ---
4.4.18.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12761 ---
4.4.18.1.1 The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train 

--- Document Chunk 12762 ---
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This is 

--- Document Chunk 12763 ---
possible only in areas so marked by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 12764 ---
4.4.18.1.2 Note: This mode is used to allow the train to escape from a dangerous situation and to 

--- Document Chunk 12765 ---
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location. 

--- Document Chunk 12766 ---
4.4.18.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 12767 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 12768 ---
b) a distance to run in the direction opposite to the train orientation , given from 

--- Document Chunk 12769 ---
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance 

--- Document Chunk 12770 ---
4.4.18.1.4 After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing 

--- Document Chunk 12771 ---
distance, and while the reversing distance is still overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 12772 ---
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the 

--- Document Chunk 12773 ---
direction opposite to the train orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 12774 ---
4.4.18.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 

--- Document Chunk 12775 ---
speed and the remaining distance to run. 

--- Document Chunk 12776 ---
4.4.18.1.6 In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3  table 5, triggering 

--- Document Chunk 12777 ---
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall command the eme rgency 

--- Document Chunk 12778 ---
brake instead of the service brake . For the revocation of the brake command, refer to 

--- Document Chunk 12779 ---
3.13.10.2.4. 

--- Document Chunk 12780 ---
4.4.18.1.7 The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the 

--- Document Chunk 12781 ---
driving cab (as before reversing). 

--- Document Chunk 12782 ---
4.4.18.1.8 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard eq uipment performs the Reverse Movement 

--- Document Chunk 12783 ---
Protection (as in RV mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 

--- Document Chunk 12784 ---
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV 

--- Document Chunk 12785 ---
mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a 

--- Document Chunk 12786 ---
directional data, oriented backwards. 

--- Document Chunk 12787 ---
4.4.18.1.9 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter  4.5 “Modes

4.4.19.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12825 ---
4.4.19.1.1 The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be operated in areas where 

--- Document Chunk 12826 ---
trackside information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 12827 ---
4.4.19.1.2 Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entere d 

--- Document Chunk 12828 ---
automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 12829 ---
4.4.19.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against a 

--- Document Chunk 12830 ---
dynamic speed profile. 

--- Document Chunk 12831 ---
4.4.19.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed  and the release 

--- Document Chunk 12832 ---
speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4.7 “DMI depending on 

--- Document Chunk 12833 ---
modes”). Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the 

--- Document Chunk 12834 ---
generic LS function marker is stored on -board or if the conditions in c lause 

--- Document Chunk 12835 ---
4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also display the 

--- Document Chunk 12836 ---
lowest speed amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 12837 ---
a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the 

--- Document Chunk 12838 ---
EOA/LOA, AND 

--- Document Chunk 12839 ---
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA 

--- Document Chunk 12840 ---
4.4.19.1.4.1 The speed resultin g from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised 

--- Document Chunk 12841 ---
Speed within the Movement Authority (LSSMA) 

--- Document Chunk 12842 ---
4.4.19.1.4.2 Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 12843 ---
equipment shall start a delay timer: 

--- Document Chunk 12844 ---
a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value  of the time stamp of the message 

--- Document Chunk 12845 ---
including the order. 

--- Document Chunk 12846 ---
b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first 

--- Document Chunk 12847 ---
encountered balise of the balise group giving the order. 

--- Document Chunk 12848 ---
c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer 

--- Document Chunk 12849 ---
(see section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed. 

--- Document Chunk 12850 ---
4.4.19.1.4.3 When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 12851 ---
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the LSSMA. 

--- Document Chunk 12852 ---
4.4.19.1.4.4 On reception of an order  to toggle (on or off) the LSSMA display, a toggle on 

--- Document Chunk 12853 ---
order which has not been executed yet (because the on -board delay timer has not 

--- Document Chunk 12854 ---
reached the delay time-out value) shall be deleted by the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 12855 ---
4.4.19.1.4.5 If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board

4.4.20 PASSIVE SHUNTING 

--- Document Chunk 12924 ---
4.4.20.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12925 ---
4.4.20.1.1 The Passive Shunting mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 12926 ---
equipment of a slave engine (NOT remote controlled, but mechanically coupled to the 

--- Document Chunk 12927 ---
leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to carry 

--- Document Chunk 12928 ---
on a shunting movement with a s ingle engine fitted with one on -board equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 12929 ---
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab. 

--- Document Chunk 12930 ---
4.4.20.1.2 The desk of a Passive Shunting engine  must be closed (since there is no driver, no 

--- Document Chunk 12931 ---
information shall be shown). 

--- Document Chunk 12932 ---
4.4.20.1.3 As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 12933 ---
shall not perform any train movement supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 12934 ---
4.4.20.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform Train Position function;  in 

--- Document Chunk 12935 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 12936 ---
train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 12937 ---
4.4.20.1.5 It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; 

--- Document Chunk 12938 ---
while in Shunting mode, the driv er shall have the possibility to enable the function 

--- Document Chunk 12939 ---
“Continue Shunting on desk closure”. 

--- Document Chunk 12940 ---
4.4.20.1.6 When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 

--- Document Chunk 12941 ---
Passive Shunting mode  if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active 

--- Document Chunk 12942 ---
and the “passive shunting input signal” is received from the train interface. If the 

--- Document Chunk 12943 ---
function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the “passive shunting 

--- Document Chunk 12944 ---
input signal” is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 

--- Document Chunk 12945 ---
Stand-By mode instead. 

--- Document Chunk 12946 ---
4.4.20.1.7 The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” shall allow one and only one 

--- Document Chunk 12947 ---
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be 

--- Document Chunk 12948 ---
inactive once the Shunting mode is left. 

--- Document Chunk 12949 ---
4.4.20.1.8 If a desk of the Passive Sh unting engine is opened  and no “Stop Shunting on desk 

--- Document Chunk 12950 ---
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard , the 

--- Document Chunk 12951 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 12952 ---
4.4.20.1.9 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Sto p Shunting on desk 

--- Document Chunk 12953 ---
opening” information previously received from balise group is stored onboard, the 

--- Document Chunk 12954 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 12955 ---
4.4.20.1.10 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive 

--- Document Chunk 12956 ---
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment sh ould therefore try to 

--- Document Chunk 12957 ---
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which sh ould be handled when the engine 

--- Document Chunk 12958 ---
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

--- Document Chunk 12971 ---
transition order shall be stored and shall be evaluated only when another mode than

--- Document Chunk 12973 ---
terminated). 

--- Document Chunk 12974 ---
4.4.20.1.12 When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 12975 ---

shall store the RBC ID/phone number information. 

--- Document Chunk 12977 ---
4.4.20.1.13 When in Passive Shunting mode, the ER TMS/ETCS on-board shall not manage RBC -

--- Document Chunk 12979 ---
RBC/RBC border. 

--- Document Chunk 12980 ---

4.5.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 13005 ---
4.5.1.1 The following table specifies in which modes the on -board functions are active or not. 

--- Document Chunk 13006 ---
The functions are described in the “Related SRS §” (second column of the table). 

--- Document Chunk 13007 ---
4.5.1.2 Note: Modes are not the only thing that can influence an onboard function. This is why 

--- Document Chunk 13008 ---
this Table is not enough in itself  to understand all the ERTMS/ETCS onboard 

--- Document Chunk 13009 ---
behaviour. It must be understood as a complement to all other SRS chapters 

--- Document Chunk 13010 ---
(especially §4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10). 

--- Document Chunk 13011 ---
4.5.1.3 Note: for DMI depending on modes, refer to §4.7. 

--- Document Chunk 13012 ---
4.5.2 Active Functions Table 

--- Document Chunk 13013 ---

4.6 Transitions between modes 

--- Document Chunk 13509 ---
4.6.1 Symbols 

--- Document Chunk 13510 ---
4.6.1.1 The indication “4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition 

--- Document Chunk 13511 ---
4.6.1.2 From the mode located in the column 

--- Document Chunk 13512 ---
4.6.1.3 To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “>”. 

--- Document Chunk 13513 ---
4.6.1.4 Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “ -px-”, x is the 

--- Document Chunk 13514 ---
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they  occur at 

--- Document Chunk 13515 ---
the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2. 

--- Document Chunk 13516 ---
4.6.1.5 Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it 

--- Document Chunk 13517 ---
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can neve r lead 

--- Document Chunk 13518 ---
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for 

--- Document Chunk 13519 ---
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and 

--- Document Chunk 13520 ---
the transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order). 

--- Document Chunk 13521 ---
4.6.1.6 "16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

4.7 DMI depending on modes 

--- Document Chunk 14121 ---
4.7.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 14122 ---
4.7.1.1 The DMI is an interface  that allows the direct exchange of information between the 

--- Document Chunk 14123 ---
driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information 

--- Document Chunk 14124 ---
done via the train interface (e.g. a driver’s action on the service brake used for the 

--- Document Chunk 14125 ---
service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 14126 ---
4.7.1.2 The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered” 

--- Document Chunk 14127 ---
is (are) not part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 14128 ---
4.7.1.3 The device(s) used to select /indicate “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not 

--- Document Chunk 14129 ---
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 14130 ---
4.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 14131 ---
4.7.1.5 Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by 

--- Document Chunk 14132 ---

--- Document Chunk 14133 ---
4.7.2 DMI versus Mode Table 

--- Document Chunk 14134 ---
4.7.2.1.1 X = active: For a  DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to 

--- Document Chunk 14135 ---
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 

--- Document Chunk 14136 ---
column. For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this 

--- Document Chunk 14137 ---
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 

--- Document Chunk 14138 ---
column). 

--- Document Chunk 14139 ---
4.7.2.1.2 A = available: This means that the input/outp ut shall become active ONLY if another 

--- Document Chunk 14140 ---
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here. 

--- Document Chunk 14141 ---
4.7.2.1.3 Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system. 

--- Document Chunk 14142 ---

4.8 Acceptance of received information 

--- Document Chunk 14542 ---
4.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 14543 ---
4.8.1.1 The aim of this chapter is to give an overview o f which information is accepted  or 

--- Document Chunk 14544 ---
rejected depending on the state of the on -board (level, mode) and the nature of the 

--- Document Chunk 14545 ---
received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill). 

--- Document Chunk 14546 ---
4.8.1.2 The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 

--- Document Chunk 14547 ---
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 14548 ---
level and transmission media”, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information 

--- Document Chunk 14549 ---
depending on the modes”. 

--- Document Chunk 14550 ---
4.8.1.3 If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that 

--- Document Chunk 14551 ---
message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information. 

--- Document Chunk 14552 ---
4.8.1.3.1 Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a 

--- Document Chunk 14553 ---
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition  shall be evaluated first 

--- Document Chunk 14554 ---
considering the on -board currently operated level, as if a level transiti on order for 

--- Document Chunk 14555 ---
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1] , [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied, 

--- Document Chunk 14556 ---
shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from 

--- Document Chunk 14557 ---
the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level. 

--- Document Chunk 14558 ---
4.8.1.4 Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a 

--- Document Chunk 14559 ---
change of level, is re -checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This 

--- Document Chunk 14560 ---
implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment – still 

--- Document Chunk 14561 ---
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the 

--- Document Chunk 14562 ---
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes 

--- Document Chunk 14563 ---
in which this information is otherwise useless. 

--- Document Chunk 14564 ---
4.8.1.5 If a message contains infill information, this  latter shall be evaluated considering all 

--- Document Chunk 14565 ---
other non-infill information in that message. 

--- Document Chunk 14566 ---
4.8.1.6 When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re -evaluating a set of 

--- Document Chunk 14567 ---
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, sh all be 

--- Document Chunk 14568 ---
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

4.8.2 Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 14689 ---
4.8.2.1 The following tables shall be applied assuming that: 

--- Document Chunk 14690 ---
a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and 

--- Document Chunk 14691 ---
with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16) 

--- Document Chunk 14692 ---
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation, 

--- Document Chunk 14693 ---
or the balise group crossing d irection (for SL , PS  and SH engines).(see section 

--- Document Chunk 14694 ---
3.6.3) 

--- Document Chunk 14695 ---
c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A” 

--- Document Chunk 14696 ---
(Accepted) comes from the supervising RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this 

--- Document Chunk 14697 ---
information is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is 

--- Document Chunk 14698 ---
still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed  

--- Document Chunk 14699 ---
Exception 1: The information “Acknowledgement of Train Data”, “ Trackside 

--- Document Chunk 14700 ---
constituent system version ”, "Session Management" and “Acknowledgement of  

--- Document Chunk 14701 ---
Session Termination" shall be immediately accepted.  

--- Document Chunk 14702 ---
Exception 2: The information “Co -operative shortening of MA” , “Revocation of 

--- Document Chunk 14703 ---
Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected. 

--- Document Chunk 14704 ---
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track descript ion is referred to the LRBG  (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 14705 ---
relocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3). 

--- Document Chunk 14706 ---
e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed 

--- Document Chunk 14707 ---
(see clause 3.14.3.6) 

--- Document Chunk 14708 ---
4.8.2.2 Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 14709 ---
decoded, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”  is 

--- Document Chunk 14710 ---
only used by the on -board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the 

--- Document Chunk 14711 ---
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are cor rectly 

--- Document Chunk 14712 ---
read, the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” , if 

--- Document Chunk 14713 ---
received, shall be ignored by the on -board equipment. Therefore this information need 

--- Document Chunk 14714 ---
not to be referred to in the following tables. 

--- Document Chunk 14715 ---
4.8.2.3 In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region 

--- Document Chunk 14716 ---
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any 

--- Document Chunk 14717 ---
further check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9. 3 b) ). 

--- Document Chunk 14718 ---
Otherwise the information VBC mar ker, if included in a consistent balise group 

--- Document Chunk 14719 ---
message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need 

--- Document Chunk 14720 ---
not to be referred to in the following tables. 

--- Document Chunk 14721 ---
4.8.2.4 Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the 

--- Document Chunk 14722 ---
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET -035), what will happen to the data to be used 

--- Document Chunk 14723 ---
by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an 

--- Document Chunk 14724 ---
external application, processed by a national function…) is outside the scope of this 

--- Document Chunk 14725 ---
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 14726 ---
functionality.

4.8.5 Handling of transition buffer in case of level transition announcement or 

--- Document Chunk 15363 ---
RBC/RBC handover 

--- Document Chunk 15364 ---
4.8.5.1 If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3 at a further location has been received , the 

--- Document Chunk 15365 ---
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see 

--- Document Chunk 15366 ---
figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages. 

--- Document Chunk 15367 ---
4.8.5.2 If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the 

--- Document Chunk 15368 ---
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be  able to store in a 

--- Document Chunk 15369 ---
transition buffer (see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from 

--- Document Chunk 15370 ---
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 15371 ---
4.8.5.2.1 Note: the term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the 

--- Document Chunk 15372 ---
transition b uffer (i.e. information which is neither accepted nor rejected immediately) 

--- Document Chunk 15373 ---
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or 

--- Document Chunk 15374 ---
according to 4.8.2.1c (for RBC/RBC handover). 

--- Document Chunk 15375 ---
4.8.5.3 In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set 

--- Document Chunk 15376 ---
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored. 

--- Document Chunk 15377 ---
4.8.5.4 The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted: 

--- Document Chunk 15378 ---
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level tra nsition 

--- Document Chunk 15379 ---
order for a different level, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15380 ---
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to 

--- Document Chunk 15381 ---
another Accepting RBC, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15382 ---
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored 

--- Document Chunk 15383 ---
information is terminated 

--- Document Chunk 15384 ---
4.8.5.5 At the s ame time the level transition is performed or at the same time the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 15385 ---
RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition 

--- Document Chunk 15386 ---
buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received. 

--- Document Chunk 15387 ---
4.8.5.6 This sequential re-evaluation of all the released information shall be a prerequisite to 

--- Document Chunk 15388 ---
any use by the on -board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change 

--- Document Chunk 15389 ---
of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the 

--- Document Chunk 15390 ---
following principles: 

--- Document Chunk 15391 ---
a) Starting from the information currently used by on -board at the moment the 

--- Document Chunk 15392 ---
level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15393 ---
determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential 

--- Document Chunk 15394 ---
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted. 

--- Document Chunk 15395 ---
b) For each information update related to a re -evaluated set of information, the same 

--- Document Chunk 15396 ---
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted 

--- Document Chunk 15397 ---
outside a level/RBC transition context.

--- Document Chunk 15409 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 15410 ---
4.8.5.7 Accepting re -evaluated Conditional Emergency Stop information according to table 

--- Document Chunk 15411 ---
4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency St op information may be 

--- Document Chunk 15412 ---
accepted or rejected in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given 

--- Document Chunk 15413 ---
stop location. This decision , based on the comparison between the min safe front end 

--- Document Chunk 15414 ---
position of the train at the time the message was received and th e given stop location, 

--- Document Chunk 15415 ---
shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re -evaluation 

--- Document Chunk 15416 ---
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4). 

--- Document Chunk 15417 ---
4.8.5.7.1 Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accep ting the 

--- Document Chunk 15418 ---
information according to table 4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see 

--- Document Chunk 15419 ---
clause 3.10.2.3) when re -evaluation of the transition buffer is completed . Information 

--- Document Chunk 15420 ---
accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buff er can then be 

--- Document Chunk 15421 ---
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10. 

--- Document Chunk 15422 ---
4.8.5.8 Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to 

--- Document Chunk 15423 ---
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted 

--- Document Chunk 15424 ---
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has 

--- Document Chunk 15425 ---
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time when 

--- Document Chunk 15426 ---
the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed. 

--- Document Chunk 15427 ---
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any 

--- Document Chunk 15428 ---
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

5.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 16089 ---
5.3.1 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 16090 ---
5.3.1.1 This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability within the 

--- Document Chunk 16091 ---
scope of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 16092 ---
5.3.1.2 Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and , where convenient, 

--- Document Chunk 16093 ---
is illustrated by a flowchart. 

--- Document Chunk 16094 ---
5.3.1.3 In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this 

--- Document Chunk 16095 ---
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 16096 ---
5.3.1.3.1 Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exit ing a procedure immediately (e. g. cut 

--- Document Chunk 16097 ---
off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment). 

--- Document Chunk 16098 ---
5.3.1.4 National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be 

--- Document Chunk 16099 ---
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is 

--- Document Chunk 16100 ---
retained. 

--- Document Chunk 16101 ---
5.3.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 16102 ---
5.3.2.1 Procedures 

--- Document Chunk 16103 ---
A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems 

--- Document Chunk 16104 ---
and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or 

--- Document Chunk 16105 ---
events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the 

--- Document Chunk 16106 ---
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities. 

--- Document Chunk 16107 ---
5.3.2.2 Entities 

--- Document Chunk 16108 ---
The procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the 

--- Document Chunk 16109 ---
entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 16110 ---
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 16111 ---
5.3.2.3 States 

--- Document Chunk 16112 ---
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions 

--- Document Chunk 16113 ---
and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains 

--- Document Chunk 16114 ---
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not 

--- Document Chunk 16115 ---
completely satisfied.  

--- Document Chunk 16116 ---
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 16117 ---
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another 

--- Document Chunk 16118 ---
one. P ossession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force 

--- Document Chunk 16119 ---
branching in states.

Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is 

--- Document Chunk 16133 ---
triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a  defined order or at the 

--- Document Chunk 16134 ---
same time. When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditions 

--- Document Chunk 16135 ---
to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

5.4 Procedure Start of mission 

--- Document Chunk 16148 ---
5.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 16149 ---
5.4.1.1 The driver may have to start a mission: 

--- Document Chunk 16150 ---
a) Once the train is awake, OR 

--- Document Chunk 16151 ---
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR 

--- Document Chunk 16152 ---
c) Once a mission is ended, OR 

--- Document Chunk 16153 ---
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 16154 ---
5.4.1.2 The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is in 

--- Document Chunk 16155 ---
Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be 

--- Document Chunk 16156 ---
already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation. 

--- Document Chunk 16157 ---
5.4.1.3 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission 

--- Document Chunk 16158 ---
is not the only possibility, the engine may be come remote controlled (i.e. the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 16159 ---
switches to Sleeping mode). 

--- Document Chunk 16160 ---
5.4.2 Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 16161 ---
5.4.2.1 At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of 

--- Document Chunk 16162 ---
three states:  

--- Document Chunk 16163 ---
a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct) 

--- Document Chunk 16164 ---
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong) 

--- Document Chunk 16165 ---
c) “Unknown” (no stored value available) 

--- Document Chunk 16166 ---
5.4.2.2 This refers to the following data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone 

--- Document Chunk 16167 ---
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3). 

--- Document Chunk 16168 ---
5.4.2.3 Note 1:  The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described 

--- Document Chunk 16169 ---
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode". 

--- Document Chunk 16170 ---
5.4.2.4 Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table 

--- Document Chunk 16171 ---
in section 5.4.3.3. 

--- Document Chunk 16172 ---

5.4.3.2 Procedure 

--- Document Chunk 16187 ---
ID # Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 16188 ---
S0 The Start of Mission procedure shall be engaged when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 16189 ---
equipment is in Stand -By mode with a desk open and no communication session is 

--- Document Chunk 16190 ---
established or is being established. 

--- Document Chunk 16191 ---
S1 Depending on the status of the Driver-ID, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 16192 ---
request the driver to enter the Driver -ID (if the Driver -ID is unknown) or shall request 

--- Document Chunk 16193 ---
the driver to revalidate or re-enter the Driver-ID (if the Driver-ID is invalid). 

--- Document Chunk 16194 ---
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the d river the possibility to 

--- Document Chunk 16195 ---
enter/re-validate (depending on the status) the Train running number. 

--- Document Chunk 16196 ---
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the possibility to 

--- Document Chunk 16197 ---
set/remove a Virtual Balise Cover. 

--- Document Chunk 16198 ---
Once the Driver-ID is entered or revalidated (E1) (possibly further to the Train running 

--- Document Chunk 16199 ---
number entry/revalidation and/or to Virtual Balise Cover setting/removal ), the process 

--- Document Chunk 16200 ---
shall go to D2 

--- Document Chunk 16201 ---
D2 If both the stored position and the stored level are valid, the process shall go to D3 

--- Document Chunk 16202 ---
If the stored posit ion or the stored level is “invalid” or “unknown”, the process shall go 

--- Document Chunk 16203 ---
to S2 

--- Document Chunk 16204 ---
D3 If the stored level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to D7 

--- Document Chunk 16205 ---
If the stored level is 0,1 or NTC, the process shall go to S10 

--- Document Chunk 16206 ---
D7 If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go 

--- Document Chunk 16207 ---
to A31 

--- Document Chunk 16208 ---
If no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network, the process shall go to S4 

--- Document Chunk 16209 ---
S2 If the status of the Level data is "unknown", the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 16210 ---
shall request the driver to enter it. 

--- Document Chunk 16211 ---
If the status of the Level data is "invalid", the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 16212 ---
request the driver to re-validate or re-enter the ERTMS/ETCS level. 

--- Document Chunk 16213 ---
If the entered / re-validated level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to S3 

--- Document Chunk 16214 ---
If the entered / re-validated level is 0, 1 or one of proposed NTC level(s) (see 3.18.4.2 

--- Document Chunk 16215 ---
for the levels the driver is allowed to select), the process shall go to S10

S3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to re -

--- Document Chunk 16230 ---
enter the Radio Network ID. If the driver elects to do so, the on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 16231 ---
terminate the ongoing communication session, if any. As soon as the related safe 

--- Document Chunk 16232 ---
connection is released, the on -board equipment shall acquire an alphanumeric list of 

--- Document Chunk 16233 ---
available and allowed networks, based on a request to the Mobile Terminal(s): 

--- Document Chunk 16234 ---
 If this list is empty (E3) the process shall go to A29 

--- Document Chunk 16235 ---
 If the driver selects a new Radio Network ID  from the proposed list, the 

--- Document Chunk 16236 ---
registration of the Mobile Terminal(s) to this new Radio Network shall be 

--- Document Chunk 16237 ---
ordered and if not “unknown” the status of the RBC -ID/phone number shall be 

--- Document Chunk 16238 ---
immediately set to “invalid”. 

--- Document Chunk 16239 ---
If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network , the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 16240 ---
on-board equipment shall offer the following options to the driver  for the RBC -

--- Document Chunk 16241 ---
ID/phone number: 

--- Document Chunk 16242 ---
 Only if the status of the RBC -ID/phone number is “invalid ” or “valid”: order the 

--- Document Chunk 16243 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use the last stored RBC -ID/phone 

--- Document Chunk 16244 ---
number 

--- Document Chunk 16245 ---
 Order the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use the EIRENE short 

--- Document Chunk 16246 ---
number (trackside call routing function) 

--- Document Chunk 16247 ---
 Enter the RBC -ID/phone number (if its status is "unknown"), or revalidate/re -

--- Document Chunk 16248 ---
enter it (if its status is “invalid” or “valid”). 

--- Document Chunk 16249 ---
Once the driver has selected the first or second option or once data is validated ( E5), 

--- Document Chunk 16250 ---
the process shall go to A31 

--- Document Chunk 16251 ---
S4 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall wait until: 

--- Document Chunk 16252 ---
 at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network ( E6); in such 

--- Document Chunk 16253 ---
case the process shall go to A31, OR 

--- Document Chunk 16254 ---
 a sufficient time (refer to Appendix A .3.1) is elapsed since it has sent the latest 

--- Document Chunk 16255 ---
Radio Network registration order to a Mobile Terminal ( E7); in such case the 

--- Document Chunk 16256 ---
process shall go to A29 

--- Document Chunk 16257 ---
A29 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver that the Radio Network 

--- Document Chunk 16258 ---
registration has failed 

--- Document Chunk 16259 ---
This condition leads to S10 (the driver has t o unlock the situation to continue e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 16260 ---
selection of new level)

--- Document Chunk 16275 ---
 If the driver selects SH ( E12), the process shall continue in the same way as the 

--- Document Chunk 16276 ---
procedure “Shunting initiated by the driver”.  

--- Document Chunk 16277 ---
If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting ( E13), the process shall 

--- Document Chunk 16278 ---
go back to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 16279 ---
 If the driver selects NL ( E10) then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 16280 ---
immediately switch to Non Leading mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transition 

--- Document Chunk 16281 ---
between modes: transition [46]). The mission starts in NL mode (if level is 2 or 3, 

--- Document Chunk 16282 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment also reports the change of mode to the 

--- Document Chunk 16283 ---
RBC).   

--- Document Chunk 16284 ---
 If the driver selects Train Data Entry (E11), the process shall go to S12   

--- Document Chunk 16285 ---
 Following E10, E12,  if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall

S13 If the status of the Train running number is  "unknown" or “invalid”, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 16294 ---
on-board equipment shall request the driver to enter /re-validate the Train running 

--- Document Chunk 16295 ---
number now. 

--- Document Chunk 16296 ---
Once Train running number is entered/re-validated (E18), the process shall go to D10. 

--- Document Chunk 16297 ---
D10 When the validated level is 2/3, the process shall go to D11 

--- Document Chunk 16298 ---
When the validated level is 0,1 or NTC, the process shall go to S20 

--- Document Chunk 16299 ---
D11 When the session is open, the process shall go to S11, otherwise it shall go to S10 

--- Document Chunk 16300 ---
S11 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall send Train Data to the RBC.

 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment, based on the system configuration 

--- Document Chunk 16376 ---
reported by the RBC, decides that compatibility is not ensured and terminates the 

--- Document Chunk 16377 ---
communication session 

--- Document Chunk 16378 ---
This condition leads to  S10 (The driver has to unlock the situation to c ontinue e.g.

5.4.5 Degraded Situations 

--- Document Chunk 16829 ---
5.4.5.1 Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has 

--- Document Chunk 16830 ---
not been taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such 

--- Document Chunk 16831 ---
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On 

--- Document Chunk 16832 ---
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 16833 ---
5.4.5.2 The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does 

--- Document Chunk 16834 ---
not exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while 

--- Document Chunk 16835 ---
performing the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or 

--- Document Chunk 16836 ---
when the driver needs to re-enter already captured data). 

--- Document Chunk 16837 ---
5.4.5.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the following 

--- Document Chunk 16838 ---
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3: 

--- Document Chunk 16839 ---
a) only at S10 and S20 and if the conditions defined in 5.8.2.1 for Stand By are 

--- Document Chunk 16840 ---
fulfilled, to select “Override”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process shall 

--- Document Chunk 16841 ---
go to the procedure “Override” and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 16842 ---
on-board shall delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”) 

--- Document Chunk 16843 ---
b) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Driver-ID 

--- Document Chunk 16844 ---
c) only at S10 and S20,to re-enter the “Train running number” 

--- Document Chunk 16845 ---
d) only at S20,  to re-enter the Train data . If the driver chooses to do so , then the 

--- Document Chunk 16846 ---
process shall go to S12. 

--- Document Chunk 16847 ---
e) only at S10 and S20, to re -enter the Level. If the driver chooses to do so, t hen the 

--- Document Chunk 16848 ---
process shall go to S2 

--- Document Chunk 16849 ---
f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the 

--- Document Chunk 16850 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode 

--- Document Chunk 16851 ---
and, if the position i s still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 

--- Document Chunk 16852 ---
position data (new status: “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 16853 ---
g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process 

--- Document Chunk 16854 ---
shall go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still 

--- Document Chunk 16855 ---
invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train position data (new status: 

--- Document Chunk 16856 ---
“unknown”). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process 

--- Document Chunk 16857 ---
shall go back to S20. 

--- Document Chunk 16858 ---
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available,  to select “Start”. If the driver chooses to 

--- Document Chunk 16859 ---
do so: 

--- Document Chunk 16860 ---
 if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23. 

--- Document Chunk 16861 ---
 if the level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22. 

--- Document Chunk 16862 ---
 if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24. 

--- Document Chunk 16863 ---
 if the level is 2/3 and a session is open, then the process shall go to S21. 

--- Document Chunk 16864 ---
 if the level is 2/3 and no session is open, then the process shall go to S24.

5.5 Procedure End of Mission 

--- Document Chunk 16897 ---
5.5.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 16898 ---
5.5.1.1 End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the 

--- Document Chunk 16899 ---
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 16900 ---
equipment when entering specific modes (see below). 

--- Document Chunk 16901 ---
5.5.2 Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission: 

--- Document Chunk 16902 ---
5.5.2.1 Stand-By mode 

--- Document Chunk 16903 ---
5.5.2.1.1 From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL,  SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERTMS/ ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 16904 ---
on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode is considered as an End of Mission 

--- Document Chunk 16905 ---
5.5.2.1.2 Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 

--- Document Chunk 16906 ---
depend on the National System. 

--- Document Chunk 16907 ---
5.5.2.1.3 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the S tand-by mode, from PT 

--- Document Chunk 16908 ---
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16909 ---
5.5.2.2 Intentionally deleted 

--- Document Chunk 16910 ---
5.5.2.3 Shunting mode 

--- Document Chunk 16911 ---
5.5.2.3.1 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS, 

--- Document Chunk 16912 ---
LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16913 ---
5.5.2.3.2 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT 

--- Document Chunk 16914 ---
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an ongoing mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16915 ---
5.5.2.3.3 Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission ma y 

--- Document Chunk 16916 ---
depend on the National System. 

--- Document Chunk 16917 ---
5.5.3 End of Mission Procedure 

--- Document Chunk 16918 ---
5.5.3.1 The procedure comprises the following steps 

--- Document Chunk 16919 ---
5.5.3.1.1 Step 1 - MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode 

--- Document Chunk 16920 ---
dependent, see Chapter 4, section "What happens to accepted and stored information 

--- Document Chunk 16921 ---
when Entering a Mode"). 

--- Document Chunk 16922 ---
End of Procedure, if there is no existing communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 16923 ---
5.5.3.1.2 If a communication session with an RIU exists: 

--- Document Chunk 16924 ---
Step 2 - The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall terminate the communication 

--- Document Chunk 16925 ---

5.6.2.2 Procedure 

--- Document Chunk 16981 ---
ID # Requirements  

--- Document Chunk 16982 ---
E015 The train is at standstill and the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in FS, 

--- Document Chunk 16983 ---
LS, OS, SR, SN, UN or PT mode or is in SB mode with necessary 

--- Document Chunk 16984 ---
preconditions fulfilled (Driver ID known, Level known, ... see procedure "Start of 

--- Document Chunk 16985 ---
mission"). 

--- Document Chunk 16986 ---
When the driver selects Shunting (E015) the process shall go to D020. 

--- Document Chunk 16987 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 16988 ---
D020 If the current ETCS Level of operation is 0 or 1, the process shall go to A050. 

--- Document Chunk 16989 ---
If the current ETCS Level of operation is 2 or 3, the process shall go to A045. 

--- Document Chunk 16990 ---
If the current ETCS Level of operation is NTC, the process shall go to D030 

--- Document Chunk 16991 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 16992 ---
D030 If there is an ongoing National Trip procedure reported by the STM, the process 

--- Document Chunk 16993 ---
shall go to A030 

--- Document Chunk 16994 ---
Otherwise the process shall go to A050 

--- Document Chunk 16995 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 16996 ---
A030 The process shall go to the “Train trip" procedure  

--- Document Chunk 16997 ---

--- Document Chunk 16998 ---
message to the RBC together with a position report (with special value “position 

--- Document Chunk 16999 ---
unknown” if the position is not known) 

--- Document Chunk 17000 ---
The process shall go to S050. 

--- Document Chunk 17001 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 17002 ---
S050 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment awaits the reply to the SH request. 

--- Document Chunk 17003 ---

5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside 

--- Document Chunk 17152 ---
5.7.1 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 17153 ---
5.7.1.1 This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.  

--- Document Chunk 17154 ---
5.7.1.2 Note: The shunting area, possibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already 

--- Document Chunk 17155 ---
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that 

--- Document Chunk 17156 ---
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed 

--- Document Chunk 17157 ---
according to the relevant procedure.   

--- Document Chunk 17158 ---
5.7.1.3 The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode p rofile, optionally 

--- Document Chunk 17159 ---
with a list of balises  groups, which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 17160 ---
board equipment is in shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 17161 ---
5.7.1.4 The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires 

--- Document Chunk 17162 ---
a driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below. 

--- Document Chunk 17163 ---
5.7.1.5 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of 

--- Document Chunk 17164 ---
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed. 

--- Document Chunk 17165 ---
5.7.2 Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from 

--- Document Chunk 17166 ---
Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 17167 ---
5.7.2.1 In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the 

--- Document Chunk 17168 ---
shunting area can be the location where a balise group is installed. In level 2/3 it is 

--- Document Chunk 17169 ---
possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment the order to switch to shunting 

--- Document Chunk 17170 ---
at the current location. 

--- Document Chunk 17171 ---
5.7.2.2 Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode 

--- Document Chunk 17172 ---
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for 

--- Document Chunk 17173 ---
which switching to SH mode is requested. 

--- Document Chunk 17174 ---
5.7.2.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 

--- Document Chunk 17175 ---
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 17176 ---
transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 17177 ---
5.7.2.4 If the driver does not acknowledge within t he driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 17178 ---
Appendix A.3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be 

--- Document Chunk 17179 ---
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless 

--- Document Chunk 17180 ---
the command was triggered also for other reasons). 

--- Document Chunk 17181 ---
5.7.3 Shunting is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 17182 ---
5.7.3.1 An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent 

--- Document Chunk 17183 ---
a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,

b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 17196 ---
5.7.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two 

--- Document Chunk 17197 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 17198 ---
a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 

--- Document Chunk 17199 ---
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile 

--- Document Chunk 17200 ---
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or v alue 

--- Document Chunk 17201 ---
given in the mode profile) 

--- Document Chunk 17202 ---
5.7.3.3 Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if 

--- Document Chunk 17203 ---
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates). 

--- Document Chunk 17204 ---
5.7.3.4 Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode , the beginning 

--- Document Chunk 17205 ---
of the shunting area shall be considered as the EOA (instead of the EOA/LOA derived 

--- Document Chunk 17206 ---
from the MA) and the SvL (with no release speed) shall be determined according to the 

--- Document Chunk 17207 ---
mode profile either: 

--- Document Chunk 17208 ---
a) as the SvL derived from the MA. In case the MA de fines an LOA, the SvL shall be 

--- Document Chunk 17209 ---
derived as if no LOA had been given. 

--- Document Chunk 17210 ---
OR 

--- Document Chunk 17211 ---
b) as the beginning of the shunting area. 

--- Document Chunk 17212 ---
5.7.3.5 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 17213 ---
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 17214 ---
5.7.3.6 If the max safe front end of the train reaches the beginning of the shunting area 

--- Document Chunk 17215 ---
according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the 

--- Document Chunk 17216 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 

--- Document Chunk 17217 ---
request for acknowledgement  shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chapter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 17218 ---
transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 17219 ---
5.7.3.7 If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement 

--- Document Chunk 17220 ---
time (refer to Appendix A .3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 17221 ---
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver 

--- Document Chunk 17222 ---
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons). 

--- Document Chunk 17223 ---
5.7.4 Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode 

--- Document Chunk 17224 ---
5.7.4.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current l evel is 2 or 3, 

--- Document Chunk 17225 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 17226 ---
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the 

--- Document Chunk 17227 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement fro m the 

--- Document Chunk 17228 ---
driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17229 ---

5.8 Procedure Override 

--- Document Chunk 17301 ---
5.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 17302 ---
5.8.1.1 In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track 

--- Document Chunk 17303 ---
circuit, failed point…), railways allow a train to pass its End of Movement Authority. 

--- Document Chunk 17304 ---
5.8.1.2 For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an End of Movement Authority can be required in 

--- Document Chunk 17305 ---
degraded situations, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 17306 ---
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable 

--- Document Chunk 17307 ---
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip). 

--- Document Chunk 17308 ---
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the  border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the 

--- Document Chunk 17309 ---
interface between RBCs is unavailable). 

--- Document Chunk 17310 ---
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two 

--- Document Chunk 17311 ---
adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established). 

--- Document Chunk 17312 ---
 In level 2/3,  if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection 

--- Document Chunk 17313 ---
with the interlocking) 

--- Document Chunk 17314 ---
 In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route 

--- Document Chunk 17315 ---
cannot be set) 

--- Document Chunk 17316 ---
 In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened 

--- Document Chunk 17317 ---
due to a time-out). 

--- Document Chunk 17318 ---
5.8.1.3 In level 0 /NTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The 

--- Document Chunk 17319 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not 

--- Document Chunk 17320 ---
supervise the train movements. 

--- Document Chunk 17321 ---
5.8.1.4 In ERTMS equipped ar eas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are 

--- Document Chunk 17322 ---
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. Receiving an order from the 

--- Document Chunk 17323 ---
signalman to pass the End of Movement Authority, the driver must then be able to 

--- Document Chunk 17324 ---
inhibit this supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 17325 ---
5.8.1.4.1 Note: The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside 

--- Document Chunk 17326 ---
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 17327 ---
5.8.1.5 If a signal at danger  must be passed between announcement and execution of the 

--- Document Chunk 17328 ---
level transition from an unfitt ed area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National 

--- Document Chunk 17329 ---
System (level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalman gives 

--- Document Chunk 17330 ---
the order to the driver to select “override”. 

--- Document Chunk 17331 ---
5.8.1.6 Note: By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the t rain driving. 

--- Document Chunk 17332 ---
Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects “override”. 

--- Document Chunk 17333 ---
5.8.1.7 In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:  

--- Document Chunk 17334 ---
a) transmitting "stop if in SR mode"

--- Document Chunk 17351 ---
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4) 

--- Document Chunk 17352 ---
5.8.2 Selection of “Override” 

--- Document Chunk 17353 ---
5.8.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” only 

--- Document Chunk 17354 ---
when: 

--- Document Chunk 17355 ---
a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override” 

--- Document Chunk 17356 ---
function (national value) AND 

--- Document Chunk 17357 ---
b) The current mode is Full Superv ision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff 

--- Document Chunk 17358 ---
Responsible, Shunting, Unfitted, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only)  or S N 

--- Document Chunk 17359 ---
(National System) AND 

--- Document Chunk 17360 ---
c) Validated Train Data and Train running number are  available (except when already 

--- Document Chunk 17361 ---
in Shunting mode). 

--- Document Chunk 17362 ---
5.8.2.2 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 17363 ---
5.8.2.3 The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17364 ---
5.8.3 Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered 

--- Document Chunk 17365 ---
5.8.3.1 The mode shall change as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 17366 ---
a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand -By or 

--- Document Chunk 17367 ---
Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if 

--- Document Chunk 17368 ---
the mode is already SR it remains unchanged) 

--- Document Chunk 17369 ---
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged 

--- Document Chunk 17370 ---
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or S N (level NTC area) the mode shall 

--- Document Chunk 17371 ---
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS 

--- Document Chunk 17372 ---
chapter 4, transitions between modes) 

--- Document Chunk 17373 ---
5.8.3.1.1 If the mode, when activating Override, is OS , LS or FS, the former EOA/LOA shall be 

--- Document Chunk 17374 ---
retained. If the mode is SB or PT,  the current position of the train front shall be 

--- Document Chunk 17375 ---
considered as the former EOA/LOA. 

--- Document Chunk 17376 ---
5.8.3.1.2 Note: This former EOA/LOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is 

--- Document Chunk 17377 ---
no longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on 

--- Document Chunk 17378 ---
the former EOA/LOA.

a) the train reads the information “stop if in SR mode” from a balise group OR 

--- Document Chunk 17392 ---
b) SR mode is left. 

--- Document Chunk 17393 ---
5.8.3.2 Note 1: In level 2, 3, if radio communication is available, the RBC is only informed that

the Override has been triggered by means of the reported mode change (if there is 

--- Document Chunk 17395 ---
any) 

--- Document Chunk 17396 ---
5.8.3.3 Note 2: In level 2,3, if the ERTMS/ETCS - onboard equipment is able to report the 

--- Document Chunk 17397 ---
mode change to the RBC, the RBC may transmit limits for the distance to run in SR 

--- Document Chunk 17398 ---

--- Document Chunk 17399 ---
to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode) 

--- Document Chunk 17400 ---
5.8.3.4 Note 3: In level 2,3, the transition to SR mode triggered by selecting Override revokes

--- Document Chunk 17410 ---
5.8.3.7.2 Exception 2: In case the Override function has been activated by selection of 

--- Document Chunk 17411 ---
“Override” while being in level 0, 1, 2 or 3, the status “override active” shall stop t o be 

--- Document Chunk 17412 ---
indicated to the driver on executing a transition to level NTC.

5.9 Procedure On-Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17464 ---
5.9.1 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 17465 ---
5.9.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train 

--- Document Chunk 17466 ---
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the 

--- Document Chunk 17467 ---
beginning of the On Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 17468 ---
5.9.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode is requested from the driver. The 

--- Document Chunk 17469 ---
conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below. 

--- Document Chunk 17470 ---
5.9.2 On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from 

--- Document Chunk 17471 ---
Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 17472 ---
5.9.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that 

--- Document Chunk 17473 ---
gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives thi s 

--- Document Chunk 17474 ---
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to On 

--- Document Chunk 17475 ---
Sight mode. 

--- Document Chunk 17476 ---
5.9.2.2 In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 

--- Document Chunk 17477 ---
profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe 

--- Document Chunk 17478 ---
front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch 

--- Document Chunk 17479 ---
to On Sight mode. 

--- Document Chunk 17480 ---
5.9.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall 

--- Document Chunk 17481 ---
be displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17482 ---
5.9.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 17483 ---
Appendix A.3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command 

--- Document Chunk 17484 ---
is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for 

--- Document Chunk 17485 ---
another reason(s). 

--- Document Chunk 17486 ---
5.9.2.5 Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed  supervision is such that the train speed 

--- Document Chunk 17487 ---
cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the 

--- Document Chunk 17488 ---
train speed was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was 

--- Document Chunk 17489 ---
allowed in Full Supervision mode, in Limited Supervision mode or in Staff Responsible 

--- Document Chunk 17490 ---
mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, 

--- Document Chunk 17491 ---
independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17492 ---
supervision (see Figure 4).

limit) at the location of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral 

--- Document Chunk 17526 ---
signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed.

--- Document Chunk 17529 ---
5.9.3 On Sight is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 17530 ---
5.9.3.1 The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached

a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 

--- Document Chunk 17533 ---
located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 17534 ---
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 

--- Document Chunk 17535 ---
located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 17536 ---
5.9.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver whe n the following 

--- Document Chunk 17537 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 17538 ---
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On 

--- Document Chunk 17539 ---
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   

--- Document Chunk 17540 ---
b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or value 

--- Document Chunk 17541 ---
given in the mode profile). 

--- Document Chunk 17542 ---
c) The current mode is not On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17543 ---
5.9.3.3 The conditions 5.9.3.2 a) and b) define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”. 

--- Document Chunk 17544 ---
5.9.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train 

--- Document Chunk 17545 ---
leaves the “re ctangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train 

--- Document Chunk 17546 ---
accelerates).

5.9.4 On Sight from Unfitted or SN mode 

--- Document Chunk 17609 ---
5.9.4.1 The mode profile with regards to an OS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2 ,3, although 

--- Document Chunk 17610 ---
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN 

--- Document Chunk 17611 ---
mode). A transition to On Sight mode can therefore earliest occur at a transition of 

--- Document Chunk 17612 ---
level: from level 0 or NTC to level 1 or 2 or 3. 

--- Document Chunk 17613 ---
5.9.4.2 Requirements about the acknowledgement in section 5.9.2 shall apply. 

--- Document Chunk 17614 ---
5.9.5 On Sight from Stand By or Post Trip mode 

--- Document Chunk 17615 ---
5.9.5.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 

--- Document Chunk 17616 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17617 ---
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the 

--- Document Chunk 17618 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the 

--- Document Chunk 17619 ---
driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17620 ---
5.9.5.2 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform 

--- Document Chunk 17621 ---
the transition to On Sight mode.” 

--- Document Chunk 17622 ---
5.9.6 Exit of On Sight mode 

--- Document Chunk 17623 ---
5.9.6.1 General rule 

--- Document Chunk 17624 ---
5.9.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall exit the On Sight mode when the min 

--- Document Chunk 17625 ---
safe front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 17626 ---
5.9.6.2 First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA 

--- Document Chunk 17627 ---
5.9.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has 

--- Document Chunk 17628 ---
the same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA. 

--- Document Chunk 17629 ---
5.9.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On 

--- Document Chunk 17630 ---
Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 17631 ---
5.9.6.2.3 Note: In an O n Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of 

--- Document Chunk 17632 ---
the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has 

--- Document Chunk 17633 ---
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of 

--- Document Chunk 17634 ---
the On Sight area. This information  

--- Document Chunk 17635 ---
 can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means  (outside 

--- Document Chunk 17636 ---
scope of  ERTMS/ETCS), or 

--- Document Chunk 17637 ---
 can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends 

--- Document Chunk 17638 ---
a “track ahead free” request which the ERTM S/ ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 17639 ---
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the 

--- Document Chunk 17640 ---
current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment will transmit this 

--- Document Chunk 17641 ---
information to the RBC.

5.10 Level Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 17729 ---
5.10.1 General requirements 

--- Document Chunk 17730 ---
5.10.1.1 Every level transition border to an area where operation in level 2, 3 or NTC is 

--- Document Chunk 17731 ---
supported shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment via balise 

--- Document Chunk 17732 ---
group or via the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 17733 ---
5.10.1.2 A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 17734 ---
consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to 

--- Document Chunk 17735 ---
the border. 

--- Document Chunk 17736 ---
5.10.1.3 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a level transition 

--- Document Chunk 17737 ---
announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on -board level, 

--- Document Chunk 17738 ---
it shall immediately inform the driver about the announced level transition. 

--- Document Chunk 17739 ---
5.10.1.3.1 Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on -board equipment may remain 

--- Document Chunk 17740 ---
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed. 

--- Document Chunk 17741 ---
5.10.1.4 At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level 

--- Document Chunk 17742 ---
transition order or a conditional level transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 17743 ---
5.10.1.4.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional 

--- Document Chunk 17744 ---
level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. 

--- Document Chunk 17745 ---
Also sleeping units read balise groups.

--- Document Chunk 17758 ---
5.10.1.5 If the message from the border balise group is not received, the level transition shall 

--- Document Chunk 17759 ---
still be executed when the estimated front end passes the location given in the 

--- Document Chunk 17760 ---
announcement. 

--- Document Chunk 17761 ---
5.10.1.6 The on -board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. 

--- Document Chunk 17762 ---
Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a 

--- Document Chunk 17763 ---
new order to switch to a different level or to the same level but at a different  location is 

--- Document Chunk 17764 ---
received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order 

--- Document Chunk 17765 ---
shall be executed.

replace any Level Transition Information already stored on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 17780 ---
5.10.1.7 As soon as the announcement of the level transition has been received, some data 

--- Document Chunk 17781 ---
(mainly movement authority and track description data) from the transmission media of 

--- Document Chunk 17782 ---
the new level shall be accepted, but shall not be used until the level transition is 

--- Document Chunk 17783 ---
effective. 

--- Document Chunk 17784 ---
5.10.1.7.1 Note: for the exhaustive list of accepted/rejected information, please refer to SRS

5.10.2.2 The level transition announcement and the immediate or conditional level transition 

--- Document Chunk 17799 ---
order at the border shall contain all the sup ported ERTMS/ETCS levels with a table of 

--- Document Chunk 17800 ---
priority. Even if only one level is permitted this is considered as a table of priority. 

--- Document Chunk 17801 ---
5.10.2.2.1 Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels. This means that, for 

--- Document Chunk 17802 ---
example, when an area permits ERTMS/ETCS level 0, and is fitted with ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 17803 ---
level 1 and 2, the track-side includes levels 0, 1 and 2 in a table of priority of supported

5.10.2.4.1 The on-board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use” 

--- Document Chunk 17824 ---
as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 17825 ---
a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on -board and at least one M obile Terminal is 

--- Document Chunk 17826 ---
available on -board, i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 17827 ---
Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or 

--- Document Chunk 17828 ---
not. 

--- Document Chunk 17829 ---
b) Level NTC: the concerned National System  is available on -board ( if an ST M is 

--- Document Chunk 17830 ---
used, refer to SUBSET-035 for further details). 

--- Document Chunk 17831 ---
c) Level 0 or 1: always. 

--- Document Chunk 17832 ---
5.10.2.4.1.1 Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment checks the 

--- Document Chunk 17833 ---
availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used) 

--- Document Chunk 17834 ---
is an implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 17835 ---
5.10.2.4.2 Examples: The table of trackside supported levels gives 2, NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1, 

--- Document Chunk 17836 ---
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board will select NTC X 

--- Document Chunk 17837 ---
level. If level 1 , 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use”, it will select level 1.  If level 2 , 1 

--- Document Chunk 17838 ---
and 0 are “Available for use”, it will select level 2. 

--- Document Chunk 17839 ---
5.10.2.5 When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level 

--- Document Chunk 17840 ---
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore 

--- Document Chunk 17841 ---
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels. 

--- Document Chunk 17842 ---
5.10.2.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level 

--- Document Chunk 17843 ---
transition only. 

--- Document Chunk 17844 ---
5.10.2.7 If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 17845 ---
equipment, it s hall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the 

--- Document Chunk 17846 ---
lowest priority. 

--- Document Chunk 17847 ---
5.10.2.7.1 Justification: The On -board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the 

--- Document Chunk 17848 ---
driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations. 

--- Document Chunk 17849 ---
5.10.2.8 The ERTM S/ETCS on -board equipment shall store the table of priority of trackside

--- Document Chunk 17892 ---
5.10.3.2.3 A level 2/3 MA and track description information shall be received from the RBC before

--- Document Chunk 17894 ---
after switching to level 2 or 3, movement is not allowed without a movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 17895 ---

--- Document Chunk 18107 ---
5.10.3.14.3 If the current level is not contained in t he priority list of the conditional level transition 

--- Document Chunk 18108 ---
order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the same way 

--- Document Chunk 18109 ---
as an immediate level transition order (see section 5.10.2). 

--- Document Chunk 18110 ---
5.10.3.14.4 In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18111 ---
shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 18112 ---
5.10.3.14.5 Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in 

--- Document Chunk 18113 ---
a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold move ment. The level of a 

--- Document Chunk 18114 ---
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the 

--- Document Chunk 18115 ---

--- Document Chunk 18118 ---
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2). 

--- Document Chunk 18119 ---
5.10.3.15.2 If the driver changes the level to 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 18120 ---
establish a communication session with the RBC: 

--- Document Chunk 18121 ---
a) immediately if at least one Mob ile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network and  a 

--- Document Chunk 18122 ---
valid RBC ID/ phone number is available, OR 

--- Document Chunk 18123 ---
b) once the driver has selected the R adio data (by the same means as for Start of 

--- Document Chunk 18124 ---
Mission), if either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or  no valid 

--- Document Chunk 18125 ---
RBC ID/phone number is available. 

--- Document Chunk 18126 ---
5.10.3.15.2.1 Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18127 ---
contact information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 

--- Document Chunk 18128 ---
PT mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18129 ---
5.10.3.15.3 If the driver changes the level from 2 or 3 to  any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board

ID # Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 18194 ---
S010 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in one of the following  

--- Document Chunk 18195 ---
modes: FS, LS, OS, SR, SB, SH, SN or UN 

--- Document Chunk 18196 ---
When an event occurs, which leads to train trip reaction (E015 – refer 

--- Document Chunk 18197 ---
to chapter 4, transitions between modes), the process shall go to 

--- Document Chunk 18198 ---
A025. 

--- Document Chunk 18199 ---
A025 The mode shall change to TR. 

--- Document Chunk 18200 ---
The process shall go to D020. 

--- Document Chunk 18201 ---
D020 If the level is 1, the process shall go to A035. 

--- Document Chunk 18202 ---
If the level is 2/3, the process shall go to A030. 

--- Document Chunk 18203 ---
If the level is 0/NTC, the process shall go to S050. 

--- Document Chunk 18204 ---
A030 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report the mode 

--- Document Chunk 18205 ---
change to the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18206 ---
The process shall go to A035. 

--- Document Chunk 18207 ---
A035 All current MA and track description data (if any), except track 

--- Document Chunk 18208 ---
conditions, shall be deleted and new ones shall not be accepted 

--- Document Chunk 18209 ---
The process shall go to S050. 

--- Document Chunk 18210 ---
S050 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment awaits standstill. While 

--- Document Chunk 18211 ---
braking a border to a level 0 or NTC area may be passed. 

--- Document Chunk 18212 ---
When the train has come to standstill (E055), the process shall go to 

--- Document Chunk 18213 ---
S060. 

--- Document Chunk 18214 ---
S060 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the "Request 

--- Document Chunk 18215 ---
for driver acknowledgement to Train Trip" to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 18216 ---
When the driver acknowledges the Train Trip (E065), the process 

--- Document Chunk 18217 ---
shall go to D080.

5.12 Change of Train Orientation 

--- Document Chunk 18482 ---
5.12.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 18483 ---
5.12.1.1 The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver controls the 

--- Document Chunk 18484 ---
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD 

--- Document Chunk 18485 ---
position. 

--- Document Chunk 18486 ---
5.12.1.2 This implies that when the driver has to change the orienta tion of the train, he has to 

--- Document Chunk 18487 ---
change the driving cab. 

--- Document Chunk 18488 ---
5.12.1.3 The scope of this procedure is NOT shunting movements, during which the driver 

--- Document Chunk 18489 ---
changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the 

--- Document Chunk 18490 ---
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE. 

--- Document Chunk 18491 ---
5.12.1.4 The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allowed in Post 

--- Document Chunk 18492 ---
Trip or in Reversing mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18493 ---
5.12.2 The driver uses the same engine (a mission is ongoing) 

--- Document Chunk 18494 ---
5.12.2.1 The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the 

--- Document Chunk 18495 ---
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine. 

--- Document Chunk 18496 ---
5.12.2.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 18497 ---
5.12.2.3 When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18498 ---
immediately goes to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see 

--- Document Chunk 18499 ---
“End of Mission” procedure). 

--- Document Chunk 18500 ---
5.12.2.4 When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 18501 ---
5.12.2.5 When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the  

--- Document Chunk 18502 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position 

--- Document Chunk 18503 ---
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data. 

--- Document Chunk 18504 ---
5.12.3 The driver leaves the engine to go to another one 

--- Document Chunk 18505 ---
5.12.3.1 The described situation is the following : The tr ain has two engines (engine A and 

--- Document Chunk 18506 ---
engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The engine B is a slave engine. Each 

--- Document Chunk 18507 ---
engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 18508 ---
a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on -board equipment is in Sleeping mode.  

--- Document Chunk 18509 ---
Note: The mode is entered when on -board equipment detects the presence of the 

--- Document Chunk 18510 ---
"remote control" signal.

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading 

--- Document Chunk 18523 ---
engine but there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment is 

--- Document Chunk 18524 ---
in Non leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18525 ---
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting operation) by the leading 

--- Document Chunk 18526 ---
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18527 ---
is in Passive Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18528 ---
5.12.3.2 Assumption: The train configuration does not change. 

--- Document Chunk 18529 ---
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will become the slave 

--- Document Chunk 18530 ---
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 18531 ---
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will 

--- Document Chunk 18532 ---
be in  SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, 

--- Document Chunk 18533 ---
afterwards engine A will be in NL mode ; If before the change of train orientation 

--- Document Chunk 18534 ---
engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18535 ---
5.12.3.3 Case "Engine B was in SL mode" 

--- Document Chunk 18536 ---
5.12.3.3.1 The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 

--- Document Chunk 18537 ---
engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission 

--- Document Chunk 18538 ---
(see “End of Mission” procedure) 

--- Document Chunk 18539 ---
5.12.3.3.2 As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board 

--- Document Chunk 18540 ---
equipment of engine B switches to Stand-By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18541 ---
5.12.3.3.3 Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of engine B opens a communication 

--- Document Chunk 18542 ---
session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18543 ---
5.12.3.3.4 When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure. 

--- Document Chunk 18544 ---
5.12.3.4 Case "Engine B was in NL mode" 

--- Document Chunk 18545 ---
5.12.3.4.1 The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches 

--- Document Chunk 18546 ---
to Non Leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18547 ---
5.12.3.4.2 Once the non leading input signal is not received any more , the ERTMS/ETCS on-

--- Document Chunk 18548 ---
board equipment  of engine B will switch to Stand -By mode ( refer to SRS chapter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 18549 ---
transitions between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure). 

--- Document Chunk 18550 ---
5.12.3.4.3 Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment enters Stand-

--- Document Chunk 18551 ---
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 18552 ---
5.12.3.5 Case "Engine B was in PS mode" 

--- Document Chunk 18553 ---
5.12.3.5.1 The driver of engine A selects "Continue Shunting on desk closure". The 

--- Document Chunk 18554 ---
ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes 

--- Document Chunk 18555 ---
the desk of engine A.

5.12.3.5.2 The driver opens a desk in engine B, a nd ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to 

--- Document Chunk 18568 ---
Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18569 ---
5.12.4 The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is ongoing) 

--- Document Chunk 18570 ---
5.12.4.1 The situation is the following : while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 

--- Document Chunk 18571 ---
Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab  A of the Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 18572 ---
engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine. 

--- Document Chunk 18573 ---
5.12.4.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 18574 ---
5.12.4.2.1 Before closing the desk A, the driver enables the function “Continue Shunting on desk 

--- Document Chunk 18575 ---
closure”. When t he driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18576 ---
shall immediately go to Passive Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18577 ---
5.12.4.2.2 When the driver opens the desk B, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 18578 ---
immediately switch back to Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18579 ---
5.12.4.3 When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the

5.13 Train Reversing 

--- Document Chunk 18594 ---
5.13.1.1 This procedure is intended to allo w the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run 

--- Document Chunk 18595 ---
away from a danger up to a “safe” location. 

--- Document Chunk 18596 ---
5.13.1.2 The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the 

--- Document Chunk 18597 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).  

--- Document Chunk 18598 ---
5.13.1.3 While th e train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be 

--- Document Chunk 18599 ---
informed that reversing is possible 

--- Document Chunk 18600 ---
5.13.1.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver’s intention to reverse (e.g. from a 

--- Document Chunk 18601 ---
direction controller in reverse position) , the ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 18602 ---
ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18603 ---
5.13.1.5 If the driver acknowledges, the on-board equipment shall switch to RV mode 

--- Document Chunk 18604 ---
5.13.1.6 Once in RV mode,  it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted 

--- Document Chunk 18605 ---
distance to run and a new maximum speed. 

--- Document Chunk 18606 ---
5.13.1.7 Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the 

--- Document Chunk 18607 ---
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for 

--- Document Chunk 18608 ---
the new permitted distance to run. 

--- Document Chunk 18609 ---
5.13.1.8 Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside 

--- Document Chunk 18610 ---
that the onboard will use only for the purpose of distance referencing.

5.14 Joining / Splitting 

--- Document Chunk 18624 ---
5.14.1 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 18625 ---
5.14.1.1 Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for bein g 

--- Document Chunk 18626 ---
split. The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train before splitting, 

--- Document Chunk 18627 ---
the “new train after splitting”, refers to the other part. 

--- Document Chunk 18628 ---
5.14.1.2 Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 

--- Document Chunk 18629 ---
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation. 

--- Document Chunk 18630 ---
5.14.2 Procedure “Splitting” 

--- Document Chunk 18631 ---
5.14.2.1 Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed 

--- Document Chunk 18632 ---
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS). 

--- Document Chunk 18633 ---
5.14.2.1.1 Note: If splitting require s moving the two train parts apart from each other for a small 

--- Document Chunk 18634 ---
distance, this can be done even in SB mode 

--- Document Chunk 18635 ---
5.14.2.2 Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train 

--- Document Chunk 18636 ---
before splitting has not performed an end of missi on for splitting, the driver must 

--- Document Chunk 18637 ---
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the new train composition after splitting.  

--- Document Chunk 18638 ---
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry 

--- Document Chunk 18639 ---
/ Modification Process) 

--- Document Chunk 18640 ---
5.14.2.3 Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 

--- Document Chunk 18641 ---
in SL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not 

--- Document Chunk 18642 ---
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  

--- Document Chunk 18643 ---
For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment open s a communication 

--- Document Chunk 18644 ---
session (if possible) and reports the mode change to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18645 ---
5.14.2.4 Step 2c - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 

--- Document Chunk 18646 ---
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not 

--- Document Chunk 18647 ---
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes and chapter 5, 

--- Document Chunk 18648 ---
“end of mission” procedure).  

--- Document Chunk 18649 ---
5.14.2.5 The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the 

--- Document Chunk 18650 ---
“Start of Mission” procedure). In al l cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility. 

--- Document Chunk 18651 ---
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible. 

--- Document Chunk 18652 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 18653 ---
5.14.3 Procedure “Joining” 

--- Document Chunk 18654 ---
5.14.3.1 Step 1 - The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be 

--- Document Chunk 18655 ---
performed in SR, OS or  SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the 

--- Document Chunk 18656 ---
national procedure for joining).

--- Document Chunk 18669 ---
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS). 

--- Document Chunk 18670 ---
5.14.3.3 Step 3a - If a former leadi ng ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment remains leading and 

--- Document Chunk 18671 ---
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with 

--- Document Chunk 18672 ---
the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see 

--- Document Chunk 18673 ---
SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process) 

--- Document Chunk 18674 ---
5.14.3.4 Step 3b - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 

--- Document Chunk 18675 ---
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18676 ---
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of 

--- Document Chunk 18677 ---
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). Transition to SL 

--- Document Chunk 18678 ---
mode is from SB mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18679 ---
5.14.3.5 Step 3c - If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is to become slave 

--- Document Chunk 18680 ---
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS cha pter 4, transitions 

--- Document Chunk 18681 ---
between modes).  

--- Document Chunk 18682 ---

5.15 RBC/RBC Handover 

--- Document Chunk 18696 ---
5.15.1 Principles 

--- Document Chunk 18697 ---
5.15.1.1 Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 18698 ---
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18699 ---
5.15.1.2 The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 18700 ---
equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and 

--- Document Chunk 18701 ---
to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border. 

--- Document Chunk 18702 ---
5.15.1.2.1 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 18703 ---
trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the new Radio 

--- Document Chunk 18704 ---
Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio Network ’s 

--- Document Chunk 18705 ---
configuration. 

--- Document Chunk 18706 ---
5.15.1.2.2 In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for 

--- Document Chunk 18707 ---
communication session with “Handing Over” RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the 

--- Document Chunk 18708 ---
one used for communication session with “Accepting” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18709 ---
5.15.1.2.3 Note: In the following sections, Radio Networks are supposed to be overlapped. 

--- Document Chunk 18710 ---
5.15.1.3 At the RBC/RBC border a balise group with an order to execute the handover 

--- Document Chunk 18711 ---
immediately shall be placed. 

--- Document Chunk 18712 ---
5.15.1.3.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted 

--- Document Chunk 18713 ---
independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups. 

--- Document Chunk 18714 ---
5.15.1.4 If the message from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall 

--- Document Chunk 18715 ---
still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location 

--- Document Chunk 18716 ---
according to the announcement information. 

--- Document Chunk 18717 ---
5.15.1.5 The on -board equipment shall manage only one RBC/RBC transition at a time, 

--- Document Chunk 18718 ---
therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order. 

--- Document Chunk 18719 ---
5.15.2 Procedure 

--- Document Chunk 18720 ---
5.15.2.1 Overview 

--- Document Chunk 18721 ---
5.15.2.1.1 In the normal operation, the main functional steps needed for running  from one RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18722 ---
area to another one are the following: 

--- Document Chunk 18723 ---
a) Pre-announcement of the transition by the “Handing Over” RBC; 

--- Document Chunk 18724 ---
b) Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & 

--- Document Chunk 18725 ---
Establishment of the radio communication session with the “Accepting” RBC; 

--- Document Chunk 18726 ---
c) Generation of movement authorities including the border;

5.15.2.2 Step by step description  

--- Document Chunk 18743 ---
5.15.2.2.1 Pre-announcement 

--- Document Chunk 18744 ---
5.15.2.2.1.1 When the “Handing Over” RBC generates a movement authority which reaches the 

--- Document Chunk 18745 ---
border to another RBC area, it initiates the processes associated to the transition. 

--- Document Chunk 18746 ---
5.15.2.2.1.2 The “Handing Over” RBC informs the “Accepting” RBC about the RBC/RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18747 ---
handover. 

--- Document Chunk 18748 ---
5.15.2.2.2 Registration to the new Radio Network of second Mobile Terminal (optional) & 

--- Document Chunk 18749 ---
Establishment of the radio communication session with “Accepting” RBC  

--- Document Chunk 18750 ---
5.15.2.2.2.1 A radio communication session with the Accepting RBC  is opened by the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 18751 ---
equipment based on the RBC transition order received from the “Handing Over” RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18752 ---
or from balise group (refer to chapter 3, section "management of radio 

--- Document Chunk 18753 ---
communication"). 

--- Document Chunk 18754 ---
5.15.2.2.2.2 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network change, the registration to 

--- Document Chunk 18755 ---
the new radio network of the second Mobile Terminal is completed before the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 18756 ---
transition order is transmitted to the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 18757 ---
5.15.2.2.3 Generation of MAs including the border 

--- Document Chunk 18758 ---
5.15.2.2.3.1 The “Handing Over” RBC is responsible for establishing the  movement authority 

--- Document Chunk 18759 ---
based on: 

--- Document Chunk 18760 ---
a) Information from the trackside equipment and interlocking of its own area (for the 

--- Document Chunk 18761 ---

--- Document Chunk 18802 ---
5.15.2.2.4.2.1 Note: The forwarding of the announcement information is executed because the 

--- Document Chunk 18803 ---
“Handing Over” RBC has no knowledge if the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in

5.19.2.2 In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 

--- Document Chunk 19767 ---
profile giving a Limited Supervision area which the train has already entered with its 

--- Document Chunk 19768 ---
max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 19769 ---
immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode. 

--- Document Chunk 19770 ---
5.19.2.3 The driver mus t acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of 

--- Document Chunk 19771 ---
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 19772 ---
5.19.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 19773 ---
Appendix A.3.1), the service brake command  shall be triggered. The  brake command 

--- Document Chunk 19774 ---
is released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for 

--- Document Chunk 19775 ---
another reason(s). 

--- Document Chunk 19776 ---
5.19.2.5 Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train 

--- Document Chunk 19777 ---
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when ent ering the Limited 

--- Document Chunk 19778 ---
Supervision mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because 

--- Document Chunk 19779 ---
a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff 

--- Document Chunk 19780 ---
Responsible mode) then an emergency brake  command could be immediately 

--- Document Chunk 19781 ---
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the LS 

--- Document Chunk 19782 ---
supervision (see Figure 22).

conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 19827 ---
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 

--- Document Chunk 19828 ---
Limited Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   

--- Document Chunk 19829 ---
b) The speed is lower than the Limited Supervision mode speed limit (national value,

or value given in the mode profile). 

--- Document Chunk 19831 ---
c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 19832 ---
5.19.3.3 Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”. 

--- Document Chunk 19833 ---
5.19.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it shall not be taken back if the train

5.19.4.1 The mode profile with regards to an LS area is only evaluated in levels 1,2,3, although 

--- Document Chunk 19898 ---
the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN

the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited 

--- Document Chunk 19905 ---
Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this 

--- Document Chunk 19906 ---
case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement 

--- Document Chunk 19907 ---
from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 19908 ---

5.19.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall exit the Limited Supervision mode when 

--- Document Chunk 19913 ---
the min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area.

5.19.6.2 First case: The Limited supervision area ends at the EOA/LOA of the current MA 

--- Document Chunk 19915 ---
5.19.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode 

--- Document Chunk 19916 ---
Profile has the same location as the EOA/LOA of the related MA. 

--- Document Chunk 19917 ---
5.19.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the 

--- Document Chunk 19918 ---
Limited Supervision area. 

--- Document Chunk 19919 ---
5.19.6.3 Second case: The Limited Supervision  area ends before the EOA /LOA of the

--- Document Chunk 19993 ---
5.20.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 19994 ---
5.20.1.1 This set of procedures specifies the information generated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 19995 ---
board equipment to an ERTMS/ETCS external function in relation to the following 

--- Document Chunk 19996 ---
track-conditions: 

--- Document Chunk 19997 ---
a) powerless section with pantograph to be lowered, 

--- Document Chunk 19998 ---
b) powerless section with main power switch to be switched off, 

--- Document Chunk 19999 ---
c) passing an “air tightness” area, 

--- Document Chunk 20000 ---
d) inhibition of a defined type of brake, 

--- Document Chunk 20001 ---
e) change of traction system, 

--- Document Chunk 20002 ---
f) change of allowed current consumption, 

--- Document Chunk 20003 ---
g) station platform. 

--- Document Chunk 20004 ---
5.20.1.2 In the following sections, the remaining distance from the concerned train end to the 

--- Document Chunk 20005 ---
concerned track condition location shall be counted positive when the train end is in 

--- Document Chunk 20006 ---
rear of the location and shall be counted negative when the trai n end is in advance of 

--- Document Chunk 20007 ---
the location. 

--- Document Chunk 20008 ---
5.20.2 Passing a powerless section with pantograph to be lowered  

--- Document Chunk 20009 ---
5.20.2.1 This procedure is dealing with the generation of the information related to a powerless 

--- Document Chunk 20010 ---
section with the pantograph to be lowered. 

--- Document Chunk 20011 ---
5.20.2.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall start the generation of the information to 

--- Document Chunk 20012 ---

--- Document Chunk 20013 ---
the point C in rear of the start location of the powerless section (see 5.18.2.2.1 for the 

--- Document Chunk 20014 ---
definition of point C). 

--- Document Chunk 20015 ---
5.20.2.3 When the min safe rear end of the train is in rear of the start location (point D) of the 

--- Document Chunk 20016 ---
powerless section, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall provide the following 

--- Document Chunk 20017 ---
information to the ERTMS/ETCS external function:

6.5.1.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 20625 ---
6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still 

--- Document Chunk 20626 ---
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this release 

--- Document Chunk 20627 ---
of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 20628 ---
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 20629 ---
be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0, and 1.1 

--- Document Chunk 20630 ---
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 20631 ---
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use for balises the following values of M_VERSION: 2.0 

--- Document Chunk 20632 ---
and 2.1. 

--- Document Chunk 20633 ---
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area 

--- Document Chunk 20634 ---
support the system version number X = 2 and the on-board requirements related to the 

--- Document Chunk 20635 ---
trackside information marked with 2.0 or 2.1 are applicable regardless of the operated 

--- Document Chunk 20636 ---
version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter operates with 

--- Document Chunk 20637 ---
the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC).

--- Document Chunk 20651 ---
6.5.1.2.6 Clause 3.9.3.2 shall be replaced with: “The orders shall be sent via balise groups.” 

--- Document Chunk 20652 ---

6.6 On-board requirements in relation to older system versions 

--- Document Chunk 21896 ---
6.6.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 21897 ---
6.6.1.1 This section covers the following situations: 

--- Document Chunk 21898 ---
a) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 21899 ---
= 1 

--- Document Chunk 21900 ---
b) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 21901 ---
= 2, but still transmitting some balise/loop/RIU information related to system version 

--- Document Chunk 21902 ---
number X = 1 (see section 6.5.2) 

--- Document Chunk 21903 ---
c) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 21904 ---
= 2, but on-board equipment has established a communication session with a 

--- Document Chunk 21905 ---
neighbouring RBC certified to system version number X = 1 

--- Document Chunk 21906 ---
d) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 21907 ---
= 1 or 2 and the on-board equipment has established a communication session with 

--- Document Chunk 21908 ---
a RBC/RIU certified to system version number X.Y = 2.0 

--- Document Chunk 21909 ---

condition is fulfilled, the on-board equipment shall consider the driver 

--- Document Chunk 21914 ---
acknowledgement as always ending the text display, regardless of the end condition 

--- Document Chunk 21915 ---
defined in 3.12.3.4.3.1”. 

--- Document Chunk 21916 ---
6.6.2.2 Exceptions to chapter 4 

--- Document Chunk 21917 ---
6.6.2.2.1 Clause 4.4.11.1.3 d) shall be replaced with: “balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in

7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language 

--- Document Chunk 22745 ---
7.3.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 22746 ---
7.3.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over t he radio, balise 

--- Document Chunk 22747 ---
and loop airgaps. 

--- Document Chunk 22748 ---
7.3.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams 

--- Document Chunk 22749 ---
(variables and packets are described in this section, while telegrams and messages 

--- Document Chunk 22750 ---
are described in chapter 8). 

--- Document Chunk 22751 ---
7.3.1.3 Note: A number of variables co ntain values which have to be assigned. Some of these 

--- Document Chunk 22752 ---
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised 

--- Document Chunk 22753 ---
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, 

--- Document Chunk 22754 ---
depending on the variable). The var iables concerned have been marked. The values 

--- Document Chunk 22755 ---
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior 

--- Document Chunk 22756 ---
verification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details. 

--- Document Chunk 22757 ---
7.3.2 Definition of Variables 

--- Document Chunk 22758 ---
7.3.2.1 Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor 

--- Document Chunk 22759 ---
units. The whole variable has one type (meaning). 

--- Document Chunk 22760 ---
7.3.2.2 Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the 

--- Document Chunk 22761 ---
variable. 

--- Document Chunk 22762 ---
7.3.2.3 Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.g. 32767 = “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 22763 ---
7.3.2.4 Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range 

--- Document Chunk 22764 ---
7.3.2.5 Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as 

--- Document Chunk 22765 ---
described in the variable definition. Variables with different me anings have different 

--- Document Chunk 22766 ---
names. 

--- Document Chunk 22767 ---
7.3.2.6 All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are 

--- Document Chunk 22768 ---
used, if used in more than one media. 

--- Document Chunk 22769 ---
7.3.2.7 Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement. 

--- Document Chunk 22770 ---
7.3.2.8 One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true. 

--- Document Chunk 22771 ---
7.3.2.9 Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where 

--- Document Chunk 22772 ---
justified. 

--- Document Chunk 22773 ---
7.3.2.10 When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall 

--- Document Chunk 22774 ---
be transmitted first. 

--- Document Chunk 22775 ---
7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

7.3.3 Definition of Packets 

--- Document Chunk 22799 ---
7.3.3.1 Packets are multiple variables grouped into a sing le unit, with a defined internal 

--- Document Chunk 22800 ---
structure. 

--- Document Chunk 22801 ---
7.3.3.2 This structure consists of a packet header with: 

--- Document Chunk 22802 ---
 Track to Train: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the 

--- Document Chunk 22803 ---
orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section 

--- Document Chunk 22804 ---
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 22805 ---
Number NID_PACKET Packet identifier 

--- Document Chunk 22806 ---
Direction Q_DIR Specifies the validity  direction 

--- Document Chunk 22807 ---
of transmitted data 

--- Document Chunk 22808 ---
Length L_PACKET  Number of bits in the packet 

--- Document Chunk 22809 ---
Scale Q_SCALE Specifies which distance scale 

--- Document Chunk 22810 ---
is used for all distance 

--- Document Chunk 22811 ---
information within the packet. 

--- Document Chunk 22812 ---
There is no Q_SCALE variable 

--- Document Chunk 22813 ---
in packets which do not contain 

--- Document Chunk 22814 ---
distance information. 

--- Document Chunk 22815 ---
Information ...... Well defined set(s) of variables. 

--- Document Chunk 22816 ---
 Train to Track: a unique packet number, the len gth of the packet in bits, optionally 

--- Document Chunk 22817 ---
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set of variables. 

--- Document Chunk 22818 ---
The packet structure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 22819 ---
Number NID_PACKET Packet identifier 

--- Document Chunk 22820 ---
Length L_PACKET  Number of bits in the packet 

--- Document Chunk 22821 ---
Scale Q_SCALE Specifies which distance scale 

--- Document Chunk 22822 ---
is used for all distance 

--- Document Chunk 22823 ---
information within the packet.

7.3.3.3 The packet definition does not  change when transmitted over different transmission 

--- Document Chunk 22839 ---
media. 

--- Document Chunk 22840 ---
7.3.3.4 All currently not defined packet identifiers are reserved for future use  and shall be 

--- Document Chunk 22841 ---
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values)  when received by the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 22842 ---
equipment. Exception: reception of information only differing by Y with regards to the 

--- Document Chunk 22843 ---
highest system version number X supported by on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11). 

--- Document Chunk 22844 ---
7.3.3.5 Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram” 

--- Document Chunk 22845 ---
do not follow the above defined structure. 

--- Document Chunk 22846 ---
7.3.3.6 N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or group of variables which 

--- Document Chunk 22847 ---
follow. 

--- Document Chunk 22848 ---
7.3.3.7 If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow. 

--- Document Chunk 22849 ---
7.3.3.8 Two nested levels of iterations can exist. 

--- Document Chunk 22850 ---
7.3.3.9 If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in t he packet, a variable is 

--- Document Chunk 22851 ---
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition 

--- Document Chunk 22852 ---
7.3.3.10 Row “Transmitted by” in the description of a packet specifies which ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 22853 ---
trackside device (b alise, loop, RIU, RBC) can  transmit this packet.  “Any” means that 

--- Document Chunk 22854 ---
the packet can be transmitted by a balise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 22855 ---
7.3.3.10.1 Row “Transmitted to” in the description of a packet specifies to which ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 22856 ---
trackside device the packet can be transmitted.

as well as functions (e .g. detection of balise reference, time and location stamp, 

--- Document Chunk 26888 ---
identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio 

--- Document Chunk 26889 ---
connection…) and performance of the transmission media.

8.3.2.1 Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission 

--- Document Chunk 26892 ---
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop). 

--- Document Chunk 26893 ---
8.3.2.2 A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 26894 ---
transmission medium). 

--- Document Chunk 26895 ---
8.3.2.3 A Eurobalise mes sage is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is 

--- Document Chunk 26896 ---
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram 

--- Document Chunk 26897 ---
from balise number 1 first), ea ch telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A 

--- Document Chunk 26898 ---
Eurobalise telegram conta ins one header and an identified and coherent set of

8.4 Rules 

--- Document Chunk 26946 ---
8.4.1 Common Rules 

--- Document Chunk 26947 ---
8.4.1.1 A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) is composed of 

--- Document Chunk 26948 ---
1. One Header, 

--- Document Chunk 26949 ---
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio), 

--- Document Chunk 26950 ---
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio), 

--- Document Chunk 26951 ---
4. Optional Packets as needed by application. 

--- Document Chunk 26952 ---
8.4.1.2 The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message 

--- Document Chunk 26953 ---
format (from top to bottom). 

--- Document Chunk 26954 ---
8.4.1.3 The behaviour of the receiv er shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given 

--- Document Chunk 26955 ---
by the message. 

--- Document Chunk 26956 ---
8.4.1.3.1 Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 

--- Document Chunk 26957 ---
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such 

--- Document Chunk 26958 ---
packet. 

--- Document Chunk 26959 ---
8.4.1.3.2 Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of balise group 

--- Document Chunk 26960 ---
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of 

--- Document Chunk 26961 ---
LRBG (radio transmission). 

--- Document Chunk 26962 ---
8.4.1.4 A track-to-train message shall contain at most one  instance of the same packet type 

--- Document Chunk 26963 ---
for the same direction. 

--- Document Chunk 26964 ---
8.4.1.4.1 Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 

--- Document Chunk 26965 ---
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system). 

--- Document Chunk 26966 ---
8.4.1.4.2 Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed 

--- Document Chunk 26967 ---
Restriction). In case of  revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding temporary 

--- Document Chunk 26968 ---
speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be 

--- Document Chunk 26969 ---
different. 

--- Document Chunk 26970 ---
8.4.1.4.3 Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The 

--- Document Chunk 26971 ---
identities of the  corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) 

--- Document Chunk 26972 ---
transmitted in the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 26973 ---
8.4.1.4.4 Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per 

--- Document Chunk 26974 ---
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is 

--- Document Chunk 26975 ---
to be considered as part of the infill information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a 

--- Document Chunk 26976 ---
balise group shall have identical content per direction.

--- Document Chunk 26988 ---
The identities of the corresponding Level Crossings (variable NID_LX) transmitted in 

--- Document Chunk 26989 ---
the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 26990 ---
8.4.1.4.6 Exception 6: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 254 

--- Document Chunk 26991 ---
(default balise, loop or RIU information). 

--- Document Chunk 26992 ---
8.4.1.4.7 Exception 7: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 145 

--- Document Chunk 26993 ---
(Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction). 

--- Document Chunk 26994 ---
8.4.1.4.8 Exception 8: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 0 

--- Document Chunk 26995 ---
(Virtual Balise Cover marker). 

--- Document Chunk 26996 ---
8.4.1.4.9 Exception 9: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain several packets 6 

--- Document Chunk 26997 ---
(Virtual Balise Cover order). The identities (pairs of variables NID_VBCMK and NID_C) 

--- Document Chunk 26998 ---
of the corresponding VBC transmitted in the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 26999 ---
8.4.1.5 A train-to-track message shall contain at most one instance of the same packet type. 

--- Document Chunk 27000 ---
8.4.1.5.1 Exception: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 

--- Document Chunk 27001 ---
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system). 

--- Document Chunk 27002 ---
8.4.1.6 Note: For the purposes of clause 8.4.1.4, when the same packet is tra nsmitted by 

--- Document Chunk 27003 ---
duplicated balises, this is considered to be only a single instance of the packet within 

--- Document Chunk 27004 ---
the message. Justification: The on -board equipment will only use one of these 

--- Document Chunk 27005 ---
duplicated telegrams (and therefore only one set of duplicated packets) to co mpose 

--- Document Chunk 27006 ---
the balise group message (see 3.16.2.4.8.2).

9.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 28064 ---
9.3.1 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 28065 ---
9.3.1.1 Chapter 9 lists a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to 8 of 

--- Document Chunk 28066 ---
the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 28067 ---
9.3.1.2 The purpose of this chapter is to ease the assessment of the compliance of an 

--- Document Chunk 28068 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment with the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 28069 ---
9.3.1.3 To that effect , this chapter comprehensively identifies which clauses contain 

--- Document Chunk 28070 ---
requirements allocated to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and conversely 

--- Document Chunk 28071 ---
which ones do not, either because they contain requirements allocated to the 

--- Document Chunk 28072 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside only or because they are of another type. 

--- Document Chunk 28073 ---
9.3.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 28074 ---
9.3.2.1 The following categories are used to classify each SRS clause: 

--- Document Chunk 28075 ---
a) ERTMS/ETCS on -board requirement : a c lause containing requirement(s) that 

--- Document Chunk 28076 ---
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 28077 ---
b) ERTMS/ETCS trackside requirement: a c lause containing requirement(s) that 

--- Document Chunk 28078 ---
must be fulfilled by a SRS compliant ERTMS/ETCS trackside, in case the 

--- Document Chunk 28079 ---
corresponding function is implemented 

--- Document Chunk 28080 ---
c) Definition: a c lause that is a necessary prerequisite to the correct interpretation of 

--- Document Chunk 28081 ---
requirement(s) or without which requirement(s) cannot be unambiguously 

--- Document Chunk 28082 ---
interpreted 

--- Document Chunk 28083 ---
d) Informative: a clause that helps the reader to better understand the context or the 

--- Document Chunk 28084 ---
justification of requirement(s) 

--- Document Chunk 28085 ---
e) Others: a clause that does not belong to any of the above categories 

--- Document Chunk 28086 ---
9.3.2.2 Throughout the SRS, the requirements are identified as sentences using the keyword 

--- Document Chunk 28087 ---
“shall”. However: 

--- Document Chunk 28088 ---
a) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on 

--- Document Chunk 28089 ---
the accompanying clause number. They can be classified  as ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 28090 ---
board and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”. 

--- Document Chunk 28091 ---
b) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables, 

--- Document Chunk 28092 ---
see chapters 7 and 8) are also described with tables. The numbered titles (i. e. the 

--- Document Chunk 28093 ---
name of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated 

--- Document Chunk 28094 ---
table are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 28095 ---
board and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword “shall” 

--- Document Chunk 28096 ---
either. 

--- Document Chunk 28097 ---
9.3.2.3 Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined , in 

--- Document Chunk 28098 ---
case a requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 28099 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on -board and 

--- Document Chunk 28100 ---
trackside req uirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability 

--- Document Chunk 28101 ---
reasons.
