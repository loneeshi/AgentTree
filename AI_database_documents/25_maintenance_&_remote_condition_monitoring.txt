Back to basics: Points maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 2 ---
and remote condition monitoring

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
Trevor Bradbeer

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
In this article, which continues the Back-to-basics 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
series on points (see February and March 2022 editions 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
of IRSE News), we will be considering three general and 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
related subject areas: scheduled maintenance; fault-

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
finding; and how Remote Condition Monitoring (RCM) 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
can assist with both of these. Initially we will consider 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
faulting and maintenance in the more traditional sense 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
BC (Before Condition monitoring!), and then move on 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
to AD (Assisted Digitally!).

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
Timely and effective maintenance of the point 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
actuating mechanism and the Switch and Crossing 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
(S&C) is essential for the safe operation of the railway. 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
As far as possible, signalling technology developments 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
have tended to reduce or eliminate moving and 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
mechanically vulnerable parts such as relays, filament 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
lamps, searchlight signals and physical panel controls. 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
However, so long as wheels run on rails there will 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
always be the need to switch trains between tracks, and 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
therefore points will be required.

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
Why maintenance matters

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
It is not hard to envisage that a mechanism pushing with 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
a force measured in thousands of Newtons, to millimetre 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
accuracy, that is run over by hundreds of tons of train moving 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
at speed will need to be maintained on a regular basis to 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
keep it in reliable working order! Maintenance of points, as 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
with other signalling assets, must be performed at intervals 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
that are frequent enough to ensure any signs of deterioration 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
are captured and rectified on a timely basis, especially where 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
safety is concerned.

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
The maintenance can be considered in two parts: the track, 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
covering the rails, chairs, crossing etc.; and the signalling, 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
covering the point actuating, lock and detection mechanism. 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
Inevitably these two functions overlap, and representatives 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
from both departments may attend the same maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
event to perform their specific tasks, whilst also advising and 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
assisting the other department in theirs. Other personnel might 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
also be involved, for example to maintain point heating where 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
required; in the UK this is usually undertaken by Electrification 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
& Plant (E&P) personnel, and is outside the scope of this article.

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
Ultimately the purpose of all maintenance is to ensure the 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
asset is presentable, operating safely, within acceptable 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
(preferably optimal) parameters, and is able to do so for as long 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
as possible. Maintenance activities can therefore be divided 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
along these lines: safety; performance; and life (prolonging) 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
- with a number of them falling into more than one category. 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
Maintenance can also be divided into preventive maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
and corrective maintenance. 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
Scheduled (preventive) maintenance

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
For reasons stated previously, scheduled maintenance is 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
by its very nature preventive maintenance; it is aimed at 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
ensuring that the equipment remains in good working order. 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
The nature of the maintenance can range from a simple 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
visual examination to cleaning, re-greasing, measuring and 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
gauging. Gauging (testing for mechanical correctness using a 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
tool of known dimensions) and measurement (using a scaled 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
instrument to determine a quantitative value) might reveal that 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
the equipment is out of tolerance and requires adjustment 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
or renewal. Visual examination might also reveal defects that 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
need to be corrected.

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
Corrective maintenance

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
If during scheduled maintenance some property of the points 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
is found to be outside the acceptable parameters it will be 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
necessary to carry out corrective maintenance. This could be 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
as simple as a small adjustment to the drive or detection, or as 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
complex as switch or machine renewal. Clearly the nature and 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
severity of the problem identified will determine its priority in 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
planned works. If the problem is safety related and cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
rectified immediately it might be necessary to restrict the use 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
or position of the points, and/or the speed of trains over them.

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
Scheduled maintenance intervals

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
Scheduled maintenance is generally divided into two types. 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
Firstly, a frequent service activity covering light maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
and essential safety checks might be carried out once every 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
three months, or as recommended by the manufacturer. Such 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
 IRSE News |  Issue 288  |  May 2022

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
25

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
servicing might be performed more frequently for ‘key points’ 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
whose operation is in high demand and therefore essential 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
for many train movements, such as at a junction where two 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
busy routes converge. Failure of these key points would incur 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
high train delay penalties and/or damage the reputation of the 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
train operator. 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
In addition to this, a more detailed maintenance activity is 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
undertaken less frequently, typically annually. This includes 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
further tests and checks on components that are not expected 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
to deteriorate quickly, for which an annual check is sufficient. 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
Maintenance standards

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
The maintenance standards adopted by a particular 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
infrastructure owner/maintainer might be the manufacturer’s 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
recommendations and instructions themselves, as is the 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
case in some countries. Alternatively, the manufacturer’s 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
recommendations may be used as the basis of standards 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
produced and issued by the relevant authority (e.g., Network 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
Rail, in the case of the main line in Great Britain). 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
Each approach has its merits. Following the manufacturer’s 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
instructions directly, once approved by the relevant authority, 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
is a potentially easier and more direct approach, whereas 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
standards produced by the infrastructure owner will have the 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
advantage of being consistent across all types of assets, and 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
take into account the individual needs of the infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
owner that the manufacturer might not include.

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
It is beyond the scope of this article to consider all the myriad 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
forms of point operating mechanism and associated specific 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
maintenance activities. But most points share common 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
categories of maintenance activity, as shown in the following 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
example. This brings together the considerations and factors 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
discussed so far and puts them into context. Although some 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
standard British mainline railway documentation has been 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
referenced, the principles are likely to apply to the majority of 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
cases on other railways.

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
Permanent Way maintenance

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
Before attempting to check the correct operation of the 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
points operating mechanism it is necessary to ensure that the 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
trackwork S&C is in good working order; there is no sense 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
and indeed some danger in adjusting the point operating 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
mechanism to compensate for an S&C problem.

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
First and foremost, it is essential that the track gauge at the 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
points is correctly maintained throughout the whole length of 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
the points at all times. If the rails are out of gauge anywhere 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
in the S&C, temporary measures might be implemented, such 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
as using packing pieces, to restore the correct dimension. 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
However, a permanent fix, such as overhaul and renewal of 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
components, should be arranged as soon as possible. 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
Secondly, it is important that the integrity of the rail furniture 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
such as chairs and stretcher bars (where provided) is 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
maintained. The traditional design of stretcher bars has come 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
under considerable scrutiny in recent years and new products 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
have been introduced in many cases. Mechanical stress in 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
the traditional stretcher bar can be high and result in metal 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
fatigue, most commonly seen as broken bars or brackets 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
(‘shoes’). Chair bolts, rail fastenings and stretcher bars must all 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
be examined and tightened, adjusted or replaced as necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
Wooden sleepers in particular should be checked for signs of 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
deterioration. Switch rails should move smoothly in the slide 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
chairs without excess friction (more about this later). 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
Thirdly, the profile of the rails should be checked. Switch and 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
stock rails are shaped (profiled) to fit together tightly when 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
closed so, as to present a relatively smooth transition for 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
passing trains. Over time both the stock rails and switch rails 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
can wear. Stock rails may show ‘lipping’ where the rail head 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
has been rolled out and this may even risk fouling the switch 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
rail. Switch rails, being very narrow at the tips, are prone to 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
chips and cracks if not aligned correctly and could be struck 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
by passing wheels. Repair work such as grinding or welding is 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
likely to be needed, and ultimately renewal might be required.

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
Points and crossings are an essential part of the railway infrastructure, and their effective 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
maintenance is critically important. Their location often poses challenges in carrying out this 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
work safely and without disrupting service.

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
 IRSE News |  Issue 288  |  May 2022

--- Document Chunk 153 ---

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
Fourthly, the lateral movement of the switch rails on the slide 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
chairs needs to be checked. One of the most common and 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
frustrating issues with switch rails is combating the friction that 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
is inevitably associated with sliding components. Initially the 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
chairs will be greased but as the points are moved the grease 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
will be progressively worn away, and can build up in places 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
where it might interfere with the operation of the points. 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
Removal of old, tarry grease deposits and the application of 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
new lubricant is necessarily a frequent maintenance activity, 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
otherwise the slide chairs will become ‘dry’ and the excess 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
friction will cause increasing stress on the point mechanism, 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
until eventually it is unable to complete the movement. 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
Innovations to address this have included using materials with 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
naturally lower friction, such as nylon, or providing rollers in 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
the slide chair that support the switch as it moves into position. 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
In both of these cases grease must not be applied as it can 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
interfere with the correct operation of the components.

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
Finally, and perhaps harder to ascertain, is the stability of the 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
ballast. As anyone who has watched train wheels pass over 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
points or indeed plain line will confirm, seemingly solid and 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
immovable rails will bend visibly under a passing train to some 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
extent, depending on its speed and weight. Over time this 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
can lead to ‘voids’ in the ballast leaving the points partially 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
unsupported and possibly twisted or warped. Visual inspection 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
might indicate that voids are present, or train-borne or 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
trackside instrumentation may provide evidence. 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
Some point mechanisms, notably ones that clamp the switch 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
and stock rail together, are notoriously sensitive to this kind 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
of rail deformation and can fail at short notice. Adjustments 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
made to compensate for the rail deformation might overcome 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
problems such as loss of detection, but then be defeated when 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
the track moves again. 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
There are various ways of preventing or reducing the risks 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
associated with voids and rail deformation. Solid track (slab 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
track), which has a concrete base, does not suffer from this 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
problem of course, but is more expensive to produce. Some 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
companies offer chemical or mechanical products to help 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
stabilise the ballast formation. The problem of point failure as 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
a result of rail deformation can also mitigated by the use of 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
‘in bearer’ operating mechanisms, which are contained within 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
a steel sleeper.

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
Signalling maintenance

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
The activities listed here are typical, but might not all be 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
relevant for a given installation or environment, and some 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
operating mechanisms might require additional signalling 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
maintenance activities.

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
Signalling maintenance personnel need to pay attention to 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
the S&C, not just the points operating mechanism. Some 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
maintenance measurements are made by both track and 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
signalling personnel. These include free wheel clearance 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
(FWC), free wheel passage (FWP) and residual switch opening 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
(RSO). All of these measurements are aimed at ensuring that 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
on the open switch rail the train wheels have sufficient space 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
to run without causing ‘flange back contact’, whereby the back 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
edge of a passing wheel flange is rubbing against the back 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
edge of the open switch rail. Such an event risks the wheel 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
riding up on the switch and causing a derailment, as happened 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
at Grayrigg, Cumbria, UK, in 2007. 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
FWC and FWP are checked by running a gauge towards the 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
heel end of the open switch rail. Additionally, it is necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
measure the distance between the open switch and the stock 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
rail at the toe; a typical value for this is 108mm but it can vary 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
by switch type.

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
Checking the RSO involves measuring the gap between 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
the closed switch rail and the stock rail where the rail head 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
profile is shaped to ensure the two fit together well. This 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
measurement is made at intervals from the toe towards 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
the heel end of the switch rail. Figure 1 shows the typical 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
measurements made.

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
Signalling maintainers will check for the tightness, correctness 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
and security of points fittings and stretcher bars (where 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
provided), drive mechanisms, cranks, rods, detectors etc. to 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
ensure that nothing is loose, cracked or out of adjustment. 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
Seasonal maintenance may include additional measures, 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
e.g. to minimise frozen points in winter by applying frost-

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
resistant grease.

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
The environment in which the points are operating must 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
be checked for cleanliness and freedom from potential 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
obstructions. This means removing debris such as litter and 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
vegetation that could find its way into the gap between an 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---

--- Document Chunk 235 ---

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
open switch and the adjacent stock rail, which would interfere 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
with the movement of the points. An excessively high ballast 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
shoulder must be brought down to an acceptable height, to 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
reduce the risk of pieces of ballast obstructing the movement.

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
The identity of the points and more specifically the operating 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
mechanism is indicated at some suitable position on or 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
adjacent to the points. In the UK, by convention the identity 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
plate is fixed on a sleeper close to the toe of the points on the 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
side nearest the normally closed switch. Though a seemingly 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
minor matter, the presence, legibility and correctness of the 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
points’ identity is crucial for accurate communications and safe 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
actions during engineering works and when operational issues 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
make it necessary to move the points manually.

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
In track circuited areas the stretcher bars and other lateral 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
fittings are fitted with insulating layers to prevent a short 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
circuit across the rails. These insulations must be checked for 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
presence and good condition to minimise the risk of a track 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
circuit failure.

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
Finally, and most importantly, we consider the maintenance of 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
the point operating mechanism itself. If there is one test that is 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
common among various types of point operating mechanism 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
it is the Facing Point Lock (FPL) test. This test is designed to 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
prove that the points can only be locked on the ground if the 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
closed switch is within an acceptable distance (3.5mm being 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
typical) of its fully closed position at the toe of the points 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
(for safety) and are guaranteed to lock if the measurement is 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
typically not more than 1.5mm (for reliability). The test is made 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
typically by inserting a 3.5mm gauge between the switch and 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
stock rail in line with the first slide chair bolt and moving the 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
points manually towards it until the lock jams. The test is then 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
repeated with a 1.5mm gauge in the same position to prove 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
that the lock engages. If either test fails, and provided that the 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
S&C has been verified as in good order, an adjustment to the 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
lock mechanism will be required.

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
In a similar vein to the FPL test is the detection test, which in 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
theory is carried out in the same way but using 3.5mm/5mm 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
gauges. This test would be naturally hindered by the action 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
of the lock, and so is carried out either by ‘floating’ the lock 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
(compensating for the detection gauge by moving the lock 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
out of the way) or by using slotted gauges that can fit around 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
the detector rods and displace them by the required distance 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
(3.5mm to achieve detection, 5mm to break detection).

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
The specific maintenance tasks on a point operating 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
mechanism itself vary considerably from machine to machine 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
depending on the type of drive used and the locking/detection 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
method. In general they will entail checks on the physical 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
condition of the machine and drive, its fastenings, lubrication, 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
fluid level for hydraulics, and mechanical wear on facing 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
surfaces. Different lubricants might be required, or none at all, 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
according to the type of mechanism involved. A drive-train of 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
gears could require a different grease from that required for 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
the drive rods - and will certainly be different to that applied to 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
the slide chairs!

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
Detection mechanisms usually rely on some form of electrical 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
contact being made, either microswitches or open contacts. 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
These are frequently the cause when a detection failure 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
occurs and therefore must be checked with gauges as part 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
of routine maintenance. Either a distance gauge is used (in 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
the case of microswitches) to determine the points at which 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
they ‘flip’ between their two states or, in the case of open 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
contacts by using a spring tension gauge to check the force 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
holding the contacts closed. Other contacts for controlling the 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
motor or clutch mechanisms might also require checking in a 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
similar manner.

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
Using remote condition monitoring to optimise 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
maintenance

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
The traditional preventive maintenance we have described 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
uses time intervals between maintenance events that is based 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
on the likelihood of failure and maintaining a high level of 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
confidence in the safe functioning of the assets. There are 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
several reasons why this approach is not optimal, including 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
the labour-intensive nature of the work, the cost of possibly 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
unnecessary maintenance activities, the risk to staff working 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
trackside, and the reduced availability of the assets for service. 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
A modern, efficient railway needs a more intelligent approach 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
and a different philosophy. From an economic point of view, 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
there is an optimum point where the level of maintenance has 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
minimal adverse business impact (see Figure 2). Maintaining 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
an asset too often is expensive, disruptive to the operation of 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
the railway and may cause more failures because personnel 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
are examining equipment and possibly interfering with what 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
was a perfectly operating point machine. On the other hand, 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
maintaining too infrequently will indeed lead to an increase in 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
failures and consequential cost penalties.

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
What is needed is a system that will allow maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
intervals to be optimised. Ideally these intervals would be 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
longer than those traditionally used, but more importantly they 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
would be both adjusted and adjustable to achieve cost, safety 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
and availability requirements. This could in theory be done 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
manually by making repeated measurements of the operation 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
of the points and plotting them on graph paper in order to 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
determine acceptable maintenance intervals, but that would 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
clearly be a somewhat “trial and error” process, involving even 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
more work at the trackside to collect the data.

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
Fortunately, developments in sensor, digital processing, 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
storage and communication technology have brought about 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
a range of different remote condition monitoring products 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
that can measure key parameters of points operation without 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
the need for personnel to repeatedly go onto the track. Note, 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
by the way that we use the abbreviation RCM for Remote 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
Condition Monitoring here, not to be confused with Reliability 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
Centred Maintenance.

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
It is now possible to measure a point machine system very 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
comprehensively, using such parameters as:

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
• Load or force on the drive rod (trackside load cell).

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
• Displacement (distance travelled, trackside sensor).

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
• Motor current and voltage (sensors in the location feeding 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
electric power to the motor).

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
• Hydraulic pressure and oil level (already provided on 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
some power packs).

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
• Detection lost and gained (contact event monitoring or 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
current sensors).

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
• Rail temperature (sensors on rails).

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
Measuring many of these parameters requires direct 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
intervention in the point operating mechanism, which could 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
make it more difficult to maintain or renew, thus defeating the 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
objectives of RCM. In the early part of this century Network Rail 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
ran a trial at Peterborough Training Centre, Cambridgeshire, 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
UK, to determine how accurately just one factor, namely motor 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
current, could be used to determine the overall condition of 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
the points from a reliability perspective. The apparent success 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
of this trial meant that most other factors would not need to 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
be fitted in future systems, although voltage readings are still 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
useful for calculating power consumption and detecting a 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
failing battery or supply. 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
Detecting motor current requires no direct connection to the 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
points circuits and can be done with sensors clipped around 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
the power supply wiring. Where discrete circuits are used to 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
drive the points in each direction a separate sensor is required 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
for each circuit, which can also be used to determine the 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
driven direction. Where three phase supplies are used one 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
sensor is required for each phase and must be connected 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
before the power switching relay, otherwise the phase reversal 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
used to change the driven direction can also upset the 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
calculations made by the data logger, especially if a voltage 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
sensor is being used to calculate power consumption as well. 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
Voltage, current and detection event monitoring can all be 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
performed away from the trackside and are therefore ideal 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
parameters to be used.

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
A data logger is used to monitor and buffer a set of samples 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
from its sensors, usually at about 100 samples per second, on 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
a rolling memory basis until a trigger value is reached (usually 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
the current at the start of the point movement). From then on 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
it will keep some of the samples already taken and record the 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
current for the duration of the movement before sending all 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
this data to a server for storage and analysis.

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
Timing detection events, from the loss of detection (e.g., when 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
the points are commanded to move from normal to reverse) 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
to gaining it again (when reverse detection is obtained), is a 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
simple indicator of health when plotted as a trend over time. 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
Statistically significant variations from the usual time can be 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
raised as alarms (e.g., 1.5s longer than usual), particularly if 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
there is a consistent and progressive change seen over time. 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
However, this is also quite a ‘blunt instrument’ means of 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
monitoring health, and gives little indication of the stress the 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
points might be experiencing as they move.

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
Motor current is another good indicator of the health of 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
the points. The more stress the machine is under to move 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
the switch rails, the greater the current drawn will be. When 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
plotted graphically it is possible to identify the key stages in the 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---

About the author

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
Trevor Bradbeer BSc (Hons) CEng Cert Ed MIRSE, 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
started his career as a trainee technician with British 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
Rail in September 1985. In 1988 he started teaching 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
basic signalling, telecoms and electrical principles at 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
the Ilford Training Centre. He went on to various roles 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
in the London area before returning to training and 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
competence management. 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
In 2004 when maintenance transferred to Network Rail, 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
Trevor stayed with Balfour Beatty working in projects 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
involving computer-based signal works testing and 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
remote condition monitoring, evolving from relay data 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
loggers to leading-edge condition monitoring systems. 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
He completed a software engineering degree in 2003, 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
became a MIRSE in 2006 and gained his CEng in 2013. 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
He also spent several years on points RCM projects for 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
SMRT/SBS in Singapore and MTR in Hong Kong. In 2019 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
Trevor retired but still works for Signet Solutions in Derby, 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
providing training and consultancy services.

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
operation such as initial motor inrush, unlocking, travel, locking 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
and braking/stopping. Excessive current levels compared with 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
that considered ‘usual’ for each point machine can be used 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
to trigger alarms and bring the equipment to the technician’s 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
attention. The analysis and raising of an alarm has evolved and 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
improved over time because the difference between a slightly 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
outlying but correct operation versus a developing fault can 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
be subtle, and barely detectable by simple threshold detection. 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
It can also result in a lot of false positives that can undermine 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
confidence in the RCM system. Some companies have 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
developed machine learning algorithms to help distinguish 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
between these, so as not to bombard the technician with 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
information that requires a great deal of experience to interpret 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
and understand.

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
Calculating power consumption can be a slightly more 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
accurate and informative parameter, but it requires a voltage 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
sensor that measures the variations which occur under load. 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
A plot of instantaneous power (the power consumed at any 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
given instant) can be converted into a measure of total power 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
consumption by calculating the area under the graph. The 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
resulting value can then be added to a scatter graph or similar 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
to observe progressive changes over time.

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
One further benefit of RCM is that it demonstrates when 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
maintenance has been effective. If the points are observed 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
by RCM to be going out of specification, an additional 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
maintenance activity can be scheduled, which should bring 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
the points back to within normal operating parameters. Using 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
RCM it is obvious when this has happened as the graphs and 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
plots will show an immediate improvement in operation time, 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
power consumption etc. If this does not happen it could point 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
to other causes that need to be investigated. 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
In the past RCM has been seen as associated specifically with 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
signalling personnel, so it has been difficult to get some track 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
personnel to agree a diagnosis when the data suggests a 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
P-Way/S&C problem. Hopefully this is changing and a spirit of 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
co-operation, together with the open sharing of this data, will 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
bring about a united approach to improve points performance 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
for the benefit of everyone.

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
The example RCM plots above show a normal (top) profile for points movement, and the profile where there is an issue 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
to be rectified, with far more power required to complete the movement.
