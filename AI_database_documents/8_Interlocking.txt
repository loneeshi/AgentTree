Back to basics: Interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
Part 1

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
This, the third in a series of articles on ‘back 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
to basics’ themes, looks at the essentials 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
of ‘interlocking’. Interlocking is central 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
to railway signalling, as it ensures that 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
the components of a signalling system 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
act together in a manner which is safe 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
for the routing and movement of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
Whole books could be written about the 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
subject, and this article is no more than an 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
introduction, intended for IRSE members 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
new to the industry rather than those who 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
are experienced in specifying, designing and 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
testing signalling systems.

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
This article focuses primarily on the technology 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
used for interlocking. Next month there will be 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
a further article, in which we will look at the 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
functionality of an interlocking – what it actually 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
does in practice. 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
What is interlocking?

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
If you ask a signal engineer about interlocking, 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
they may well point to an equipment room full 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
of relays, or a cabinet of computer equipment 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
in a control centre, or perhaps even some 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
complicated-looking arrangement of metalwork 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
underneath a lever frame in a signal box. It is 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
true that all these things are ‘interlockings’, but 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
‘interlocking’ is defined as a feature of a control 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
system that makes the state of two functions 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
mutually dependent. In the context of railway 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
signalling, interlocking is used to keep trains 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
safe from collision and derailment. The primary 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
purposes of these interlocking features are 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
to ensure that:

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
1. Bef ore a train is given authority to move along 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
a section of track from one signal to the next:

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
• points are in the correct position (to 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
avoid derailment),

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
• there are no trains already on the track (to 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
avoid collision), and

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
• no conflicting train movements are already 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
authorised (also to avoid collision).

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
2. When a train has been given authority to move:

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
• points in the section of track are prevented 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
from being moved, and

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
• other trains are prevented from entering the 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
same section of track.

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
 until the train has passed thr ough the 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
section of route.

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
There is more to interlocking than this, as we shall 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
see, but this is the essence of what it is all about.

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
What does interlocking not do?

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
Interlocking does not check that everything is safe 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
for the passage of a train. A section of railway track 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
must be safe for the passage of trains in many 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
other ways as well. For instance, the distance 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
between the rails must be correct, the track-bed 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
must be capable of supporting the weight of a 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
train, and the train’s cross-sectional dimensions 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
(the dynamic envelope) must be compatible with 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
the positioning of items such as platforms and 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
bridges, so that the train will not hit them. These 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
can also cause collision or derailment – but 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
they are not generally the concern of the signal 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
engineer. Railway engineers have other methods 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
for ensuring the integrity of these other features 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
upon which train safety depends.

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
Interlocking safety

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
Interlocking functions (such as moving a set of 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
points or clearing a signal) must be executed only 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
when it is safe to do so. Industrial control systems 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
(of which railway signalling is an example) are 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
designed to meet a specified ‘safety integrity level’ 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
(SIL). There are five such levels, from 0 to 4, and 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
the interlocking functions in a modern main line or 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
metro railway signalling system must usually meet 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
SIL 4 requirements – the highest level possible. 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
This means the likelihood of an unsafe failure is 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
incredibly small. 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
The underlying safety principle traditionally 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
associated with railway signalling, and particularly 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
with the interlocking, is known as the ‘fail-safe’ 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
“Interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
does not check 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
that everything 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
is safe for the 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
passage of a 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
train”

--- Document Chunk 91 ---

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
principle. This means that if an interlocking system 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
develops a fault, it is designed so that it will fail in 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
a manner which stops trains, by putting signals 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
to danger. This fail-safe property is achieved in 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
various ways, including the use of inherently fail-

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
safe components, the design of the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
logic, and the system architecture. 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
It is important to note that ‘fail-safe’ does not 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
mean that the signalling of trains is 100% safe. This 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
is partly because in practice the occurrence of 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
unsafe failures cannot be completely eliminated, 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
and partly because if trains have been stopped 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
by a (safe) failure of the signalling system, the 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
movement of trains then depends largely upon 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
the application of operational procedures, with the 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
associated risk of human error.

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
Not all parts of a signalling system need to be 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
ultra-safe. In modern systems the use of high 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
integrity (SIL 4) design techniques is usually 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
restricted to those parts of the system which are 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
essential for safety – including the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
functionality. Other parts, such as the control 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
panel or desk, are usually of a lower integrity 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
(typically SIL 0 to SIL 2). You might wonder why 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
we do not design all parts of the signalling system 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
to achieve SIL 4 levels of safety. The answer is 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
that designing systems to meet high levels of 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
safety integrity is complex, time-consuming 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
and expensive, and can lead to lower levels 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
of reliability. 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
A little history…

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
When railways first appeared, they had no 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
signalling in the form that we would recognise 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
today. The concept of a signal box did not exist, 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
signals were very rudimentary (originally just a 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
man with a flag), and giving permission for a train 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
to enter a section of track relied simply upon 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
allowing sufficient time for the preceding train to 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
have left the section – without any knowledge of 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
whether in practice it had done so!

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
Not surprisingly, it didn’t take long for accidents 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
to demonstrate the need for safer ways of 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
controlling the movement of trains. This article 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
does not explore the evolution of railway 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
signalling, but there were some key milestones 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
in its development which are worth noting. One 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
was the introduction of the electric telegraph, so 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
that someone at one end of section of railway line 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
could communicate with someone at the other 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
end. This eliminated the need for ‘time interval 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
working’ by enabling the person controlling entry 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
to a section of line to receive positive confirmation 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
when the whole of the preceding train had left the 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
section and therefore the line was again ‘clear’. 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
A second crucial development was the 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
introduction of the signal box, to enable signals 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
and points to be controlled from one place. 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
Previously the setting up of a route for a train had 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
relied upon people walking about on the track to 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
move points and operate signals. Centralisation 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
of these activities was not only more efficient and 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
reduced the possibility of misunderstanding, it 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
also facilitated the introduction of ‘interlocking’ 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
– mechanical equipment in the signal box that 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
helped to prevent mistakes being made by 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
the signaller when moving points or operating 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
signals. Even in the age of computerisation, it is 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
remarkable to look back at how railway engineers 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
of the 19th century invented mechanical logic 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
systems that largely overcame the risk of human 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
error when signalling trains.

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
So, the way was paved for the introduction 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
of ‘interlocking’ according to a defined set of 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
principles or rules – which for the most part still 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
apply today, albeit they vary in some respects from 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
railway to railway.

Interlocking technologies

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
Mechanical interlocking

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
The earliest form of interlocking was purely 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
mechanical. Signal boxes were usually two storey 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
buildings, with the signaller working upstairs 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
and the interlocking downstairs. To allow a 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
train to move, the signaller would operate large 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
levers, separate ones being provided for each 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
set of points and for each signal. These levers 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
were directly connected via mechanical rods 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
and/or wires to the points and signals outside, 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
and therefore could require considerable 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
effort to move. 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
On the ground floor of the signal box, underneath 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
the levers, was an arrangement of metal bars that 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
were connected to the levers, with other bars at 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
right-angles to the first. The physical interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
of the two sets of bars prevented the signaller 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
from moving a lever unless other levers were in 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
the correct position. So, for instance, he could 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
not move a signal lever to allow a train to move 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
unless the relevant points levers were in the 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
correct position. 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
Gradually engineers began to introduce simple 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
electro-mechanical locking in combination 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
with the mechanical locking, to prevent a lever 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
from being moved unless its electric lock was 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
energised. Energisation of the lock (via an 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
electrical circuit) required other levers to be 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
electrically proved to be in the correct position. 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
Further conditions were progressively added to 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
the lock circuits to improve safety, such as the 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
requirement for relevant track circuits to be clear 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
before a signal or set of points could be moved. 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
Safety features were also added to the block 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
systems that controlled the movement of trains 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
between neighbouring signal boxes, to prevent a 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
signaller from sending a train from the area that he 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
controlled to that of the next signal box unless it 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
was safe to do so. 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
Mechanically interlocked signal boxes are still in 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
use on railways in many parts of the world, well 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
over 125 years since they were introduced.

Figure 2a Figure 2b Figure 2c

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
A flat metal bar (called a tappet) is 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
attached to the end (tail) of each lever. 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
All the tappets are held within a locking 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
box, so that each one moves in one 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
direction when the corresponding lever 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
is pulled to its reverse position, and in 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
the opposite direction when the lever is 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
pushed back to its normal position.

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
To create a lock, a bevelled notch is cut 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
in the side of a tappet, and a locking 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
piece (sometimes called a nib) is cut 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
to fit the notch. If a horizontal bar is 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
placed in the locking box with one 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
end connected to the locking piece, 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
and the other end is connected to 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
another locking piece, the movement 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
of one lever is prevented or permitted 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
according to whether a locking piece is 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
held in a notch in the tappet, or is clear 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
of (or free to move out of) the notch. 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
The use of bevelled edges enables a 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
tappet, when free to move, to force the 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
locking piece out of the notch.

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
In Figure 2a below, when Lever 1 is 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
pulled from normal to reverse, the 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
tappet will move in the direction of the 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
arrow. The positions of the tappets and 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
locking pieces will then be as shown in 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
Figure 2b, and Lever 4 is locked in the 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
normal position. It cannot be moved 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
because the second locking piece 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
(connected to the first) has engaged in 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
the notch in the tappet of Lever 4 and 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
is not free to move out of it. Thus Lever 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
1 locks Lever 4. The converse is also 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
true. If Lever 1 is normal and Lever 4 is 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
reverse, Lever 4 locks Lever 1 normal, 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
as shown in Figure 2c (this is called 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
reciprocal locking and is an inherent 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
feature of mechanical locking). Much 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
more complicated locking arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
can be created than the simple one 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
shown, with levers being locked in both 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
normal and reverse positions by multiple 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
other levers, and with locking of one 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
lever by another being conditional on 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
the position of a third lever.

How does mechanical interlocking work?

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
Electrical interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
The advantages of using electrical locking 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
became even more evident when colour light 

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
signals and electric point machines began to be 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
introduced. Mechanical locking could be entirely 

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
replaced by electric locking, and large levers were 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
no longer necessary for operating points and 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
signals, since no great physical effort was required 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
by the signaller to switch an electric signal 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
or point machine.

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
Early all-electric signal boxes used miniature 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
mechanical levers on a desk, replicating in 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
a more modern form the row of levers in 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
mechanical boxes. This evolution led in time to 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
the introduction of control panels, with switches 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
and buttons on the panel being used to set 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
whole routes from one signal to the next, without 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
the signaller needing to set the points in the 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
route individually.

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
The ‘route setting’ approach eventually became 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
the preferred form of control. The role of the 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
interlocking was crucial in this. Instead of being 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
a passive system for determining whether it was 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
safe to operate a set of points or a signal (as 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
mechanical locking had been), it became an active 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
system that interpreted and acted on requests 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
received from the control panel. In simple form, 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
the request to set a route from one signal to the 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
next is set up by the signaller using switches and 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
buttons on the control panel (which has a diagram 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
of the track layout on it). The interlocking then 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
moves the relevant points provided it is safe to do 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
so, checks that the track is clear of other trains, 

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
and clears the entrance signal for the route.

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
Relays

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
The fundamental building block of the traditional 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
route-setting interlocking is the relay. Before the 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
relay interlocking gained prominence, relays had 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
already been used for track circuits and for other 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
simple circuits in mechanical and early electric 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
signal boxes. These relays had generally been 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
relatively large devices, often designed to sit on 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
shelves. But as relay interlockings became more 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
popular, relays were progressively made physically 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
smaller, and were often designed to plug into 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
bases to which all the wiring was connected, so 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
making it easy to replace a faulty one as well as 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
enabling hundreds or even thousands of them to 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
be housed in a much smaller space. All the wiring 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
and the relays and their bases were mounted on 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
vertical racks, and a large interlocking might have 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
dozens of such racks, all housed in a ‘relay room’.

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
Not sure what a relay is?

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
A relay is an electromechanical switch, with an 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
electromagnetic coil, an armature and various 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
contacts. When the coil is energised, the armature 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
moves and closes a number of contacts (‘front’ or 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
‘normally open’ contacts) and opens others (‘back’ 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
or ‘normally closed’ contacts). These contacts 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
are used in other circuits to create the logic 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
conditions for operating other relays, powering 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
point machines, illuminating the aspects of signals 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
etc. When the coil is de-energised the armature 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
returns to its original position, opening the front 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
contacts and closing the back contacts.

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
Relay interlocking architecture and design

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
The architecture of relay interlockings varies from 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
railway to railway (even within a single country), 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
and from country to country. We are not going 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
to explore all the variations here, but it is worth 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
understanding a little about the basic design 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
philosophies that characterise almost all relay 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
interlockings. 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
In the early days all relay interlockings were ‘free 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
wired’. With this approach, each circuit, whatever 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
its purpose or function, was individually designed 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
and wired, usually in accordance with a set of 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
templated (standard) circuits. In time an alternative 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
approach emerged, whereby manufacturers 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
provided a range of factory-wired, pre-tested 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
sets of relays known as ‘geographical’ units. Each 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
type of unit was designed to provide the standard 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
interlocking functions required for a specific 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
combination of signals, points and train detection 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
sections. By connecting the appropriate units 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
together (usually with plug-coupled cables) to 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
mimic the actual layout of the track and signalling, 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
the required route-setting functionality could be

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
built up relatively easily. There are advantages and 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
disadvantages with both approaches, including 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
cost, flexibility, speed of design and testing.

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
Secondly, the relay interlocking circuits (both 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
free-wired and geographical types) vary in form 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
according to the type of relay used. There are, 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
broadly speaking, two generic types of relay used 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
for all interlockings. One type is inherently ‘fail-

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
safe’, meaning that if the coil is de-energised, the 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
front contacts will always open, and it is virtually 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
impossible for a failure to occur whereby front 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
and back contacts are in the ‘closed’ position at 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
the same time. The use of non-welding materials 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
for the contacts makes it impossible for a contact 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
to weld in the closed position. This type of relay 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
is known generically as type N in UIC standard 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
736i. The best-known family of signalling relays 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
in this category is probably the BR930 series, the 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
development of which, incidentally, involved the 

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
IRSE. There are at least 200 variations of this same 

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
basic relay, with different operating characteristics 

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
(slow to energise, slow to de-energise etc), 

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
different numbers and types of contacts, and 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
different operating voltages. 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
The other generic type of relay used in some 

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
interlocking systems is known as type C in UIC 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
standard 736i. It is not guaranteed to behave in 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
the inherently fail-safe manner described above. 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
Specifically, it is possible for a contact to weld 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
so that it remains closed when it should be open 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
although, as with a type N relay, the mechanical 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
design prevents any front and back contacts being 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
closed at the same time, even if welding occurs (a 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
feature known as ‘forcibly guided’ contacts). Such 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
relays have the advantage of being considerably 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
less expensive and smaller. But in order for the 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
interlocking as a whole to behave in a fail-safe 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
manner, the circuits are more complicated as 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
a consequence of using additional contacts to 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
prove that relays have de-energised correctly, 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
and because of the need to check that the 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
circuits are operating in the correct sequence 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
with the passage of the trains. By contrast, the 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
dependable fail-safe nature of the type N relay 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
makes it generally unnecessary to include this 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
additional complexity.

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
In all interlockings the circuits are designed to 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
exploit the safety characteristics of the relays. 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
Usually this is done by requiring a relay to be 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
energised to allow a less restrictive state (e.g. to 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
allow a signal to show a proceed aspect, or to 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
allow a set of points to move). If the relay or the 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
power supply fails, or there is a disconnection in 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
the circuit, the relay de-energises, so causing the 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
signalling equipment to revert to a safer state.

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
Computer-based interlockings (CBI)

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
With the development of electronic logic gates in 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
the form of integrated circuits, and subsequently 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
with the emergence of the microprocessor and 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
programmable logic controllers (PLCs), it was a 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
natural step to see how this technology could 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
be applied to interlockings. Early experimental 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
installations were implemented in the 1960s 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
and 1970s, but it was in the mid-1980s that 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
the electronic software-based interlocking first 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
became a reality. One of the best known of 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
these was SSI – the ‘Solid State Interlocking’, 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
developed in the UK.

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
The use of software-driven electronic logic 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
presented a whole new set of challenges for 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
system designers. A route relay interlocking is, 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
in effect, a hard-wired parallel processing logic 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
machine. If it goes wrong it could initiate unsafe 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
actions, but the potential failure modes and 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
their causes are well-understood and, by good 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
design practice and by testing it to make sure 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
the locking conforms to the application rules, 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
the probability of an unsafe failure is very low. A 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
computer-based interlocking (CBI), which makes 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
use of microprocessors, is another matter entirely, 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
however. Microprocessors comprise hardware and 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
embedded software, and these are not designed 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
to meet the high integrity safety requirements 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
Figure 5 – Route relay 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
interlockings have 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
been very successful 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
in a huge range of 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
applications world-wide. 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
In this example from the 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---

--- Document Chunk 490 ---

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
necessary for an interlocking. Failure modes of 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
microprocessor-based systems are much more 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
complex and unpredictable than in relay logic, 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
and their causes can be difficult to trace. These 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
causes include electrical interference, unstable 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
supply voltages, poor programming (leading 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
to memory stack overflows, race conditions, 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
deadlock, etc), derived requirement errors and 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
manufacturing defects.

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
The architecture of the software-based 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
interlocking must be designed so that the overall 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
level of safety is at least as safe as the best relay 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
interlocking, despite the relatively low integrity of 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
the component parts and the complexity of their 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
failure modes. The basic approach is to have two 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
separate processing channels in the interlocking, 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
each one executing the route requests from the 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
control panel (or desk/VDU) in accordance with 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
the signalling principles and application rules for 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
the particular track and signalling layout. This is 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
known as a ‘two out of two’ (2oo2) configuration. 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
In the event of a difference in the outputs from 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---
the channels (indicating an error has occurred), 

--- Document Chunk 533 ---
the system shuts itself down and a safe state is 

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
enforced. In most systems lineside signals return 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
to danger (stop) and points cannot be moved. 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
In practice, achieving a safe shutdown is not 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
quite as simple as it might at first appear. Firstly, 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
the part of the system that compares the outputs 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
of the two channels and shuts the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
down in the event of a difference must be highly 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
dependable. A simple electronic comparator that 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
is monitoring the two outputs is not sufficient. 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
Secondly, there is the problem of common mode 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
failure. Since both channels are executing the 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
same task, there could be processor problems 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
or programming errors which would affect both 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
channels in the same way. In such circumstances 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
there would be no disagreement between the 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
outputs presented to the comparator, and the 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
system would consequently not shut down.

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
There are various solutions to these problems, of 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
course, and different system manufacturers adopt 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
different approaches. These may involve:

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
• using different hardware and/or software for 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
the two channels to reduce the likelihood of 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
common mode failure (often called ‘diversity’).

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
• more complex cross-checking of internal 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
states, inputs and outputs between the two 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
channels in order to detect faults.

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
• more than one mechanism by which a 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
shutdown can be enforced (and employing 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
special hardware for the purpose). 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
These mechanisms are not without their 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
difficulties. For instance, a lack of synchronisation 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
(differences in timing) of processing in the two 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
channels can cause the two channel outputs 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
to be different for short periods of time, even 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
though each channel is behaving correctly. These 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
short-term differences may be interpreted by any 

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
cross-checking as an error and cause a shutdown, 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
creating a serious threat to reliability.

Figure 6 – Achieving safety and availability in 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
interlocking systems typically involves the adoption of 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
one of the architectures shown here.

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
Above left, ‘two out of two’ requires both processing 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
channels to determine a course of action which will 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
only be carried out if both agree. If either fails then the 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
system shuts down to a safe state.

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
Above right, duplicating two sets of ‘two out of two’ 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
and switching between the two pairs increases system 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
availability.

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
Right, ‘two out of three’ uses three processing channels. 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
At least two channels must agree on an action before it 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
is taken, but failure of a single channel will not lead to a 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
shut down.

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
“Failure modes of

Reliability of CBIs

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
The reliability of computer-based interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
is almost as important as their intrinsic safety. A 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
fault in a relay interlocking (such as a failure of 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
a relay) may cause a small number of routes to 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
be inoperable, but it is very unlikely to render the 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
whole interlocking unusable and thus stop all 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
trains. But a computer-based interlocking that 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
detects a processing fault may shut itself down 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
completely, stopping all trains in the area of 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
control. Most modern CBIs therefore have built-in 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
redundancy to improve reliability. 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
One approach is to have three processing 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
channels in the interlocking, instead of two. If 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
one channel disagrees with the other two, a 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
majority voting system shuts it down and the 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
interlocking continues operating with the two 

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
remaining channels. This configuration is known 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
as ‘Two out of Three’ (‘2oo3’) and was popular 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
in early CBIs when computers were expensive, 

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
because it used less hardware than the alternative 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
arrangement described below. There is a marginal 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
safety disbenefit in this arrangement, because 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
very rarely it could be that one channel is correct 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
and the other two are in error. In addition, if 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
the same software is used in all three channels 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
then common mode failure remains a risk and 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
producing three diverse sets of code and/or 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
hardware to avoid such failures would be very 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
expensive and create an even greater risk of 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
timing issues. However, the other safeguards built 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
into the systems makes these issues extremely 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
unlikely in practice. 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
Alternatively, some interlockings have a complete 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
duplication of the two channels (i.e., two sets, 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
each comprising two channels) – a configuration 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
known as ‘Duplicated Two out of Two’ (2X2oo2). 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
If one set identifies a disagreement between its 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
channels, it is shut down and the other set (which 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
is in effect a ‘hot standby’) continues to operate 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
the railway. This tends to be a more popular 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
arrangement in modern interlockings, as it is 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
easier to implement than 2oo3 and the cost of the 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
additional hardware is not such a big issue as it 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
used to be. The set of hardware and software that 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
is acting as the hot standby must have all the same 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
inputs and be kept in complete synchronism with 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
the controlling set otherwise the changeover will 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
not be seamless and some form of initialisation 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
process will be required.

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
Configuring CBIs

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
All interlockings must be configured for the 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
particular track and signalling layout required 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
– a task generally performed by a signal 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
design engineer. In the case of computer-

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
based interlockings, he or she has to produce 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
configuration logic (program code and/or data) – 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
a process commonly known as ‘data preparation’.

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
The concepts of ‘free-wired’ and ‘geographical’ 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
relay interlockings have their equivalents in 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
computer-based interlockings, each with their 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
advantages and disadvantages. Both make use 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
of the duplication and redundancy techniques 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
described above to achieve required levels of 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
safety and reliability.

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
The free-wired equivalent typically uses general 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
purpose safety PLCs which are configured for 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
each specific railway layout. A notation known 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
as ‘Ladder Logic’ is frequently used to configure 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
the system, although it is also possible to use 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
fundamental Boolean logic or more sophisticated 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
PLC programming languages. Ladder logic 

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
resembles a conventional circuit diagram that 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
has switches, relay coils and contacts, and other 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
electrical elements such as counters, latches and 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
timers. It is therefore intuitively easy to produce by 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
someone familiar with relay circuits.

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
The equivalent of a geographical relay 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
interlocking uses a more conventional form 

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
of microprocessor-based computer. The core 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
system (the ‘generic product’) is customised by 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
incorporating standard software modules which 

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
define how basic track and signalling elements 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
operate in accordance with the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
principles for the railway on which it is to be 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
used. This hardware and software package is the 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
signalling manufacturer’s interlocking country/

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
client-specific product (known as the ‘generic 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
application’). The signal design engineer then 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
produces application data which defines how 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
the country/client-specific software modules 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
are configured to represent the particular track 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
and signalling layout (known as the ‘specific 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
application’). The data format is usually proprietary 

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
to each manufacturer’s system.

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
In both types of interlocking, the safety of the 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
railway is critically dependent not only upon 

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
the core interlocking product but also upon the 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
correctness of the specific application data/logic, 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
which is why so much effort goes into checking 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
and testing it.

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
Nowadays a large proportion of the data and 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
logic for computer-based interlockings can be 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
generated automatically from the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
scheme specifications. Signal design engineers 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
can therefore concentrate their skills on the 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
special or unusual interlocking elements of a 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
signalling scheme which cannot be designed 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
automatically. Simulation and automated testing 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
can also reduce the amount of manual verification 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
and validation required. Because interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
primarily implement a set of logical rules they are 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
particularly well suited to testing and validation 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
using formal methods and automation. Most 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
of the major interlocking suppliers have now 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
adopted these methods in some form and as 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
a result the number of errors found by more 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
conventional testing, particularly in the field, has 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
reduced very significantly.

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
The interfaces between an 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
interlocking and other sub-systems

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
In a modern signalling system, an interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
interfaces with a number of other sub-systems. 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
The three most important interfaces are with 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
the trackside equipment, with the control panel 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
(or computer workstation), and with other 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
neighbouring interlockings. There are of course 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
other interfaces, but we are not attempting 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
here to describe the architecture of a complete 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
signalling system, so they are not explored 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
in this article.

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
Interlocking to control panel/desk 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
interface

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
The signaller controls the movement of trains 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
either by use of a control panel or by using a 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
control desk and workstation. A panel is equipped 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
with a representation of the track layout, on which 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
are buttons and switches for setting routes etc, 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
and indications to show him or her information 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
including what routes are set, the positions of 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
trains and the aspects of signals. In the case of 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
a control desk and workstation, the signaller 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
has the same information presented to him/

her on screen and sets routes etc by use of a 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
keyboard and mouse.

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
The interface with the interlocking is therefore 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
two-way, with route requests being sent from 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
the control panel/desk to the interlocking and 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
information from the interlocking being sent to 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
the control panel/workstation. There is usually 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
some sort of interface sub-system (either relays or 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
software-based) between the two. 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
A typical control panel/desk will communicate 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
with several interlockings, as the geographical 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
area covered by the control panel/desk is often 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
larger than that covered by a single interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
Where all the interlockings are housed in 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
the same building as the control panel/desk, 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
the communication with the interlockings is 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
communications bus. If some of the interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
are in buildings some distance from the control 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
centre, then some form of remote control and 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
indication system (using, for instance, time-

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
division multiplexing) is often used to connect 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
interlockings to the control centre to reduce the 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
amount of cabling required. 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
It is important to note that all these 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
communication links are not safety-critical (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
they do not have to be SIL 4). The interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
ensures the safety of train movements even if 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
there is a fault or failure in the communications 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
links or interface sub-systems. That said, the 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
interfaces and communications links must be as 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
reliable as possible, both for normal working and 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
in degraded mode situations. In both cases, the 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
control panel or workstation is presenting the 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
signaller with information about the railway, upon 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
which he or she makes decisions regarding the 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
movement of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
Many modern signalling systems include 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
Automatic Route Setting (ARS), a sub-system 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
which automatically sets routes ahead of each 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
train based on the timetable and, where conflicts 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
arise (eg because of late running), on a set of rules 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
for prioritisation of train movements. This relieves 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
the signallers of much of their routine work. So 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
far as the interlocking is concerned, however, it 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
receives and acts on ARS route-setting requests 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
in the same way as if the requests had come from 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
the signaller and the control panel/workstation.

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
Interlocking to trackside equipment 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
interface

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
In the case of a relay interlocking, in most 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
systems the items of trackside equipment (signals, 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
points, track circuits etc) are connected to the 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
interlocking by multi-core cables, with a dedicated 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
pair of cores for each circuit. The cables are 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
generally specified and constructed to meet 

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
railway requirements, both in terms of resilience 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
to the trackside environment, and in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
the integrity and separation of each core. This is 

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
necessary because they are carrying safety critical 

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
circuits for operating the signals, moving points, 

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
indicating the occupancy or otherwise of a track 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
circuit to the interlocking etc. The interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
depends upon the integrity of these circuits in 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
order to function safely.

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
In the case of computer-based interlockings, the 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
items of trackside equipment are normally (but not 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
always) connected to nearby object controllers 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
which provide the power for the equipment, pass 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
the interlocking commands to the equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
receive equipment status information for sending 

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
back to the interlocking. The object controllers 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
are connected to the trackside equipment by high 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
integrity cables as described above, and to the 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
interlocking via a communications datalink. Just 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
as with relay interlockings, the integrity of the 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
communication link is vital for the safe operation 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
of the interlocking. The object controllers 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
therefore generally have a 2oo2 configuration 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
to ensure safety, and the datalink uses highly 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
secure coding techniques to prevent (or detect) 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
corruption of the transmitted data. In some 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
manufacturers’ systems the communications 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
protocol is proprietary to their product, but 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
increasing use is now being made of IP addressing 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
techniques. Manufacturers still use their own 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
safety and applications protocols, although the 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
European EULYNX project is promoting open 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
standards for interfaces, to reduce signalling 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
life cycle costs.

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
Interlocking to interlocking interface

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
Interlockings must be able to interface with 

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
neighbouring interlockings, because almost 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
inevitably at the geographical boundaries there 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
will be routes that have their entrance signal in 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
the area controlled by one interlocking and their 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
exit signal in the area controlled by another. 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
The route setting process is initiated by the 

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
interlocking responsible for the entrance signal, 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
but requires action by, and information from, the 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
other interlocking in order for the complete route 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
to be declared ‘set’, before the entrance signal is 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
allowed to clear. 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---

control systems to

continues to ensure

that the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
rules are enforced 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---

the non-vital control

system above allows

the railway to be 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
operated optimally.

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
It is common practice, so far as possible, 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
to arrange the geographical boundaries of 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
interlockings to occur on sections of plain line, 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
where the interlocking arrangements for each 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
cross-boundary route are very straightforward. 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
However, this is not always possible, particularly 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
in places such as complex station areas where 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
more than one interlocking is required. In 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
the case of relay interlockings, the interface 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
generally takes the form of high integrity multi-

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
core cables to link circuits in the two equipment 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
buildings – the same sort of cables as are used to 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
connect the relay interlockings with their items of 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
trackside equipment.

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
In the case of computer-based interlockings, a 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
high integrity datalink is used for the interface 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
(bearing in mind that the two interlockings may 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
well be in physically adjacent cabinets in an 

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
equipment room rather than in separate buildings). 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
However, the interfacing arrangements tend 

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
to be more complex than in the case of relay 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
interlockings. The two sets of software have to 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
act together and perform ‘handshakes’ with each 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
other in order to set, lock and release routes. 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
The future of interlocking

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
At the beginning of this article we said that 

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
‘interlocking’ is the mutual dependency between 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
signalling functions (moving points, clearing 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
signals etc). We have seen how these interlocked 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
functions are made real by use of some sort of 

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
‘logic machine’, whether mechanical, electrical 

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
or computerised, which signal engineers call 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
an interlocking. In a modern signalling system 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
we might expect to see a relay interlocking or 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
a suite of computer interlockings housed in a 

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
building or in a cabinet trackside, connected 

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
to trackside equipment, the control panel/

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
desk and screen, and to other interlockings by 

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---
cables and data transmission systems. But the 

--- Document Chunk 1032 ---
concept of a physically discrete interlocking is 

--- Document Chunk 1033 ---
starting to change. 

--- Document Chunk 1034 ---
Various examples come to mind. Firstly, in the 

--- Document Chunk 1035 ---
case of ERTMS Levels 2 and 3, there is a second 

--- Document Chunk 1036 ---
vital element in the system, namely the Radio 

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
Block Centre (RBC), which links trains with 

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
the interlocking, sending information about 

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
movement authorities, permissible speeds etc and 

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
receiving information about the train speed and 

--- Document Chunk 1041 ---
location. Like the interlocking, the RBC must be 

--- Document Chunk 1042 ---
of the highest safety integrity. System suppliers 

--- Document Chunk 1043 ---
are starting to combine these two functions on 

--- Document Chunk 1044 ---
the same computer platform, and in the world of 

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
metros, a number of systems already combine 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
the functions of interlocking and track-train 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
messaging within the same system.

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
A second possibility, and one that is already 

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
being explored, is to use cloud technology 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
for interlocking. This has various advantages, 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
including cost, flexibility and, potentially, 

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
resilience. It also comes with challenges, not the 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
least of which is maintaining cyber-security (and 

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
therefore safety as well as reliability).

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
Thirdly, we may see a move towards distributed 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
interlocking functionality. In recent years the trend 

--- Document Chunk 1057 ---
has been to place computer-based interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 1058 ---
together in a single location (often co-located 

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
with the control centre). In time this may change, 

--- Document Chunk 1060 ---
with some interlocking functions shared between 

--- Document Chunk 1061 ---
the train-borne and trackside systems. Indeed, it 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
could be argued that this is already happening to a 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
limited extent with CBTC and ERTMS. 

--- Document Chunk 1064 ---
Even more radically, the train may play a key role 

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
in initiating the setting of the route ahead and in 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
determining its own safe movement authority, 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
making use of train-to-train communications 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
to do so. A more train-centric architecture will 

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
be adopted, with the trains being ‘smart’ rather 

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
than simply responding to movement authorities 

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
issued by trackside infrastructure systems. Again, 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
suppliers are already starting to make some of 

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
this a reality. This may well lead in time to some 

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
of the traditional principles of signalling being 

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
challenged, such as making the distance between 

--- Document Chunk 1076 ---
following trains dependent upon their relative 

--- Document Chunk 1077 ---
speeds rather than always assuming the train 

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
ahead is stationary.

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
Closing remarks

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
This article has provided an introduction to 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
the technologies used for railway interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
Next month we will look at the functionality of 

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
an interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
If you want to know more, some of the IRSE 

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
textbooks cover the subject in greater detail. For 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
many signal engineers the specification and design 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
of interlockings is at the heart of their careers. It 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
requires knowledge, experience and expertise – 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
and it is vital to the safety of the railway. But if you 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
are new to the industry, don’t let that deter you. 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
Instead, take every opportunity to learn from those 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
who have the experience and knowledge.

Back to basics: Interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
Part 2

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
Last month in IRSE News there was the 

--- Document Chunk 1121 ---
third in a series of articles on ‘back to 

--- Document Chunk 1122 ---
basics’ themes, looking at the essentials of 

--- Document Chunk 1123 ---
‘interlocking’, focused on the technology 

--- Document Chunk 1124 ---
used. This month we are going to look 

--- Document Chunk 1125 ---
at the functions that an interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 1126 ---
performs, and how these ensure the safe 

--- Document Chunk 1127 ---
movement of trains.

--- Document Chunk 1128 ---
This article is no more than an introduction 

--- Document Chunk 1129 ---
to the subject, intended for IRSE members 

--- Document Chunk 1130 ---
new to the industry rather than those who are 

--- Document Chunk 1131 ---
experienced in specifying, designing and testing 

--- Document Chunk 1132 ---
signalling systems. 

--- Document Chunk 1133 ---
The functions of a modern 

--- Document Chunk 1134 ---
interlocking

--- Document Chunk 1135 ---
We saw in last month’s article that interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 1136 ---
have used a variety of mechanical, electrical, 

--- Document Chunk 1137 ---
electronic and software-based technologies over 

--- Document Chunk 1138 ---
the years. But regardless of what technology is 

--- Document Chunk 1139 ---
used, a route-setting interlocking must perform 

--- Document Chunk 1140 ---
essentially the same functions in order to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 1141 ---
the safe movement of trains. These functions, 

--- Document Chunk 1142 ---
which are defined in the railways’ signalling 

--- Document Chunk 1143 ---
principles and application rules, must be 

--- Document Chunk 1144 ---
compatible with the operational rules/regulations 

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
for the movement of trains, under both normal 

--- Document Chunk 1146 ---
and failure conditions. 

--- Document Chunk 1147 ---
The signalling principles and application rules for 

--- Document Chunk 1148 ---
the interlocking functions vary somewhat from 

--- Document Chunk 1149 ---
country to country but are similar in their basic 

--- Document Chunk 1150 ---
requirements. The descriptions of the principal 

--- Document Chunk 1151 ---
functions in this article are based on the current 

--- Document Chunk 1152 ---
signalling principles used for colour light lineside 

--- Document Chunk 1153 ---
signalling of passenger railways on the mainline 

--- Document Chunk 1154 ---
railway in Great Britain and in some other 

--- Document Chunk 1155 ---
countries (they are relaxed somewhat for shunting, 

--- Document Chunk 1156 ---
permissive and freight movements, but these are 

--- Document Chunk 1157 ---
not covered in this article). Where some railways 

--- Document Chunk 1158 ---
adopt significantly different practices, these are 

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
noted but are not described in any detail. 

--- Document Chunk 1160 ---
Checking route availability

--- Document Chunk 1161 ---
When a request to set a route is sent from the 

--- Document Chunk 1162 ---
control panel/desk/VDU (or from the Automatic 

--- Document Chunk 1163 ---
Route Setting system, where one is provided), 

--- Document Chunk 1164 ---
the interlocking first checks that the route can be 

--- Document Chunk 1165 ---
set in its entirety, and that the request does not 

--- Document Chunk 1166 ---
conflict with any other routes that have already 

--- Document Chunk 1167 ---
been set or are in the process of being set. 

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
Without this check, the interlocking might start 

--- Document Chunk 1169 ---
moving points to set the route but fail to complete 

--- Document Chunk 1170 ---
the process because one or more points are 

--- Document Chunk 1171 ---
locked in the wrong position by routes that are set 

--- Document Chunk 1172 ---
for other train movements. The check is also vitally 

--- Document Chunk 1173 ---
important for ‘directly opposing’ routes, for trains 

--- Document Chunk 1174 ---
travelling in the opposite direction to the route 

--- Document Chunk 1175 ---
whose availability is being checked, and for which 

--- Document Chunk 1176 ---
the point settings are identical. 

--- Document Chunk 1177 ---
If the whole of the route is not available for 

--- Document Chunk 1178 ---
setting at the time the request is received by the 

--- Document Chunk 1179 ---
interlocking, it is rejected or ignored, rather than 

--- Document Chunk 1180 ---
being stored until the route can be set. This is 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
a feature known as ‘anti-preselection’. Not all 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
railways include it, but it is often regarded as 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
good practice to prevent a route request from 

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
continuously trying to make the interlocking set a 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
route that cannot (yet) be set.

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
Route setting and locking

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
When the route availability check is successfully 

--- Document Chunk 1188 ---
completed, the interlocking starts moving the 

--- Document Chunk 1189 ---
points in the route to their required positions. It 

--- Document Chunk 1190 ---
may also be necessary to move other points that 

--- Document Chunk 1191 ---
are not in the route itself, to protect the route 

--- Document Chunk 1192 ---
from other trains in the event that they pass a 

--- Document Chunk 1193 ---
signal that is displaying a stop aspect.

--- Document Chunk 1194 ---
When the points are correctly positioned, route 

--- Document Chunk 1195 ---
locking is applied to all the track detection 

--- Document Chunk 1196 ---
sections that form the route, thereby reserving 

--- Document Chunk 1197 ---
each section for the route being set, preventing 

--- Document Chunk 1198 ---
the points from being moved and ensuring that no

Overlaps

--- Document Chunk 1210 ---
Many countries and railway administrations also 

--- Document Chunk 1211 ---
lock and protect a short section of track beyond 

--- Document Chunk 1212 ---
the exit signal as part of the route-setting process. 

--- Document Chunk 1213 ---
This is called the ‘overlap’, and it is typically 

--- Document Chunk 1214 ---
between 50m and 200m in length. The provision 

--- Document Chunk 1215 ---
of overlaps is not a universal practice, however. 

--- Document Chunk 1216 ---
Some railways do not use overlaps at all and, at 

--- Document Chunk 1217 ---
the other extreme, some have overlaps which 

--- Document Chunk 1218 ---
comprise, in effect, all the track from the exit 

--- Document Chunk 1219 ---
signal to the next signal beyond that. Even on 

--- Document Chunk 1220 ---
railways that use overlaps, they are not necessarily 

--- Document Chunk 1221 ---
required for all types of routes. Where railways do 

--- Document Chunk 1222 ---
use overlaps the rules for setting and locking them 

--- Document Chunk 1223 ---
vary from one railway administration to another, 

--- Document Chunk 1224 ---
so it is worth emphasising that this description 

--- Document Chunk 1225 ---
applies to main line railways in Great Britain and is 

--- Document Chunk 1226 ---
not necessarily true of other railways.

--- Document Chunk 1227 ---
The purpose of an overlap is that if the exit signal 

--- Document Chunk 1228 ---
is at danger (stop) and the train fails to come 

--- Document Chunk 1229 ---
to a stand at the signal because of inadequate 

--- Document Chunk 1230 ---
deceleration, it is likely to stop within the overlap 

--- Document Chunk 1231 ---
distance and so avoid risk of collision with other 

--- Document Chunk 1232 ---
legitimate train movements. Of course, it is 

--- Document Chunk 1233 ---
not guaranteed that the train will stop within 

--- Document Chunk 1234 ---
the overlap, and an overlap is of no help at all 

--- Document Chunk 1235 ---
if the train brakes have not been applied or the 

--- Document Chunk 1236 ---
adhesion conditions are very poor. It should also 

--- Document Chunk 1237 ---
be noted that with cab signalling, overlaps have an 

--- Document Chunk 1238 ---
additional purpose, to do with the accuracy with 

--- Document Chunk 1239 ---
which the train location is known.

--- Document Chunk 1240 ---
Trailing points in an overlap are set to the correct 

--- Document Chunk 1241 ---
position and locked when a route is set. Where 

--- Document Chunk 1242 ---
there are facing points ahead of the exit signal 

--- Document Chunk 1243 ---
there may be more than one overlap that can 

--- Document Chunk 1244 ---
be used. These facing points must be set to the 

--- Document Chunk 1245 ---
position required for the selected overlap, and 

--- Document Chunk 1246 ---
they may also be locked. The reason for not 

--- Document Chunk 1247 ---
locking the facing points in all circumstances 

--- Document Chunk 1248 ---
is that in complex areas such as stations, the 

--- Document Chunk 1249 ---
interlocking may permit the overlap to be changed 

--- Document Chunk 1250 ---
after the entrance signal has been cleared (a 

--- Document Chunk 1251 ---
feature known as ‘swinging overlaps’) by moving 

--- Document Chunk 1252 ---
the position of the facing points to create a new 

--- Document Chunk 1253 ---
overlap. This provides signallers with greater 

--- Document Chunk 1254 ---
operational flexibility. The facility to swing an 

--- Document Chunk 1255 ---
overlap is inhibited by the interlocking as the 

--- Document Chunk 1256 ---
train approaches the exit signal so that a safe 

--- Document Chunk 1257 ---
(locked) overlap exists in case the train passes the 

--- Document Chunk 1258 ---
signal at danger. Designing the circuits or data 

--- Document Chunk 1259 ---
for swinging overlaps can become very complex 

--- Document Chunk 1260 ---
indeed, however, and their provision should be 

--- Document Chunk 1261 ---
limited to that which is considered necessary for 

--- Document Chunk 1262 ---
operational purposes. 

--- Document Chunk 1263 ---
The setting of an overlap happens only if the exit 

--- Document Chunk 1264 ---
signal is at danger (stop), of course. If a further 

--- Document Chunk 1265 ---
onward route is set for the train, from the exit 

--- Document Chunk 1266 ---
signal to the next signal beyond, then that route 

--- Document Chunk 1267 ---
is itself set and locked in the same manner as 

--- Document Chunk 1268 ---
described above.

--- Document Chunk 1269 ---
Clearing the entrance signal

--- Document Chunk 1270 ---
When the route has been set (as described 

--- Document Chunk 1271 ---
above), all relevant train detection sections 

--- Document Chunk 1272 ---
must be proved ‘clear’ (i.e. no train or vehicles 

--- Document Chunk 1273 ---
present) before the entrance signal is permitted 

--- Document Chunk 1274 ---
by the interlocking to show a proceed 

--- Document Chunk 1275 ---
aspect. This includes:

--- Document Chunk 1276 ---
• All the track that forms the route between the 

--- Document Chunk 1277 ---
entrance and exit signals.

--- Document Chunk 1278 ---
• All the track that forms the overlap ahead of 

--- Document Chunk 1279 ---
the exit signal (if an overlap is provided).

--- Document Chunk 1280 ---
• Any other sections of track on which a train or 

--- Document Chunk 1281 ---
individual rail vehicle could stand and be ‘foul’ 

--- Document Chunk 1282 ---
of the route (i.e. with which the authorised 

--- Document Chunk 1283 ---
train could collide).

--- Document Chunk 1284 ---
• Any ‘flank’ sections of track, which are 

--- Document Chunk 1285 ---
included to provide early detection of another 

--- Document Chunk 1286 ---
train passing its own exit signal at danger 

--- Document Chunk 1287 ---
(SPAD) and thereby intruding onto the route of 

--- Document Chunk 1288 ---
the authorised train.

--- Document Chunk 1289 ---
In the case of lineside signalling, other checks may 

--- Document Chunk 1290 ---
also be required before the signal is permitted 

--- Document Chunk 1291 ---
Interlocking has been an 

--- Document Chunk 1292 ---
underpinning concept 

--- Document Chunk 1293 ---
for railway safety since 

--- Document Chunk 1294 ---
the 1850s, although 

--- Document Chunk 1295 ---
the technology upon it 

--- Document Chunk 1296 ---
depends has changed 

--- Document Chunk 1297 ---
phenomenally during  

--- Document Chunk 1298 ---
that period. Areas of 

--- Document Chunk 1299 ---
points and crossings are 

--- Document Chunk 1300 ---
the most complex part of 

--- Document Chunk 1301 ---
any interlocking design.

--- Document Chunk 1308 ---
to clear, including the following. Not all railways 

--- Document Chunk 1309 ---
apply these checks, and the specific rules for 

--- Document Chunk 1310 ---
applying them vary from one railway to another:

--- Document Chunk 1311 ---
• The exit signal must be alight (i.e. displaying 

--- Document Chunk 1312 ---
a visible aspect), to avoid the risk of the driver 

--- Document Chunk 1313 ---
failing to see it.

--- Document Chunk 1314 ---
• If the entrance signal is required to display 

--- Document Chunk 1315 ---
a route indication for the route set, that 

--- Document Chunk 1316 ---
indication must be proved alight before the 

--- Document Chunk 1317 ---
entrance signal is permitted to display a 

--- Document Chunk 1318 ---
proceed aspect.

--- Document Chunk 1319 ---
• If the train is being routed over a diverging 

--- Document Chunk 1320 ---
junction ahead of the entrance signal, that 

--- Document Chunk 1321 ---
signal may be held at a restrictive aspect (stop 

--- Document Chunk 1322 ---
or caution) by the interlocking until the train 

--- Document Chunk 1323 ---
has slowed down sufficiently for the diverging 

--- Document Chunk 1324 ---
points and the route beyond. 

--- Document Chunk 1325 ---
There may be other requirements that have to 

--- Document Chunk 1326 ---
be satisfied before the interlocking will permit 

--- Document Chunk 1327 ---
the entrance signal to clear, for instance for level 

--- Document Chunk 1328 ---
crossings or train protection systems (the latter to 

--- Document Chunk 1329 ---
stop, or mitigate the risk of, the train passing its 

--- Document Chunk 1330 ---
exit signal at danger). 

--- Document Chunk 1331 ---
The actual aspect displayed by the entrance 

--- Document Chunk 1332 ---
signal when it clears, including any speed or route 

--- Document Chunk 1333 ---
indications, depends not only upon the route 

--- Document Chunk 1334 ---
immediately ahead, but also on whether a further 

--- Document Chunk 1335 ---
route has been set for the train beyond the exit 

--- Document Chunk 1336 ---
signal. The sequence of aspects seen by a driver 

--- Document Chunk 1337 ---
at successive signals as he or she approaches a 

--- Document Chunk 1338 ---
signal at danger (stop) varies from one railway to 

--- Document Chunk 1339 ---
another and is not dealt with in this article.

--- Document Chunk 1340 ---
On most railways that use colour light signalling, 

--- Document Chunk 1341 ---
the entrance signal will revert to danger (stop) 

--- Document Chunk 1342 ---
if the conditions that permitted it to clear are 

--- Document Chunk 1343 ---
no longer fulfilled. So, for instance, if a track 

--- Document Chunk 1344 ---
circuit in the route fails, or there is a loss of 

--- Document Chunk 1345 ---
detection on a set of points, the entrance signal 

--- Document Chunk 1346 ---
will automatically revert to danger. This is a safe 

--- Document Chunk 1347 ---
arrangement but can be worrying for a driver who 

--- Document Chunk 1348 ---
unexpectedly encounters a signal at danger (stop). 

--- Document Chunk 1349 ---
Some railways do not include reversion – and 

--- Document Chunk 1350 ---
of course, with mechanical signals there was no 

--- Document Chunk 1351 ---
possibility of doing so! 

--- Document Chunk 1352 ---
Route holding and release

--- Document Chunk 1353 ---
When the train passes the entrance signal 

--- Document Chunk 1354 ---
(showing a proceed aspect), the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 1355 ---
returns the entrance signal to danger (stop) but 

--- Document Chunk 1356 ---
maintains the locking ahead of the train to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 1357 ---
points from being moved and conflicting routes 

--- Document Chunk 1358 ---
from being set. In order to maximise capacity and 

--- Document Chunk 1359 ---
flexibility it is, however, desirable for the locking 

--- Document Chunk 1360 ---
to be removed as soon as it is safe to do so after 

--- Document Chunk 1361 ---
the passage of the train, in order that other routes 

--- Document Chunk 1362 ---
may be set which make use of the same track 

--- Document Chunk 1363 ---
(or some of it). 

--- Document Chunk 1364 ---
Before the locking can be released after the 

--- Document Chunk 1365 ---
passage of the train, the route request must first 

--- Document Chunk 1366 ---
be cancelled. Traditionally this would be done 

--- Document Chunk 1367 ---
by the signaller using the control panel/desk. 

--- Document Chunk 1368 ---
However, to ease the signaller’s workload and 

--- Document Chunk 1369 ---
to enable the locking to be released as soon as 

--- Document Chunk 1370 ---
possible, many modern interlockings include 

--- Document Chunk 1371 ---
a function called ‘train operated route release’ 

--- Document Chunk 1372 ---
(TORR), which cancels the route request from 

--- Document Chunk 1373 ---
the control panel/desk when the train has passed 

--- Document Chunk 1374 ---
the entrance signal, without any action by the 

--- Document Chunk 1375 ---
signaller. The interlocking normally does this by 

--- Document Chunk 1376 ---
checking that the first two or three train detection 

--- Document Chunk 1377 ---
sections beyond the signal show ‘occupied’ and 

--- Document Chunk 1378 ---
then ‘clear’ in the correct sequence with the 

--- Document Chunk 1379 ---
passage of the train (this minimises the risk of a 

--- Document Chunk 1380 ---
train detection failure leading to the premature 

--- Document Chunk 1381 ---
release of the route). Although the route request 

--- Document Chunk 1382 ---
is cancelled by this process, the route locking is 

--- Document Chunk 1383 ---
maintained to ensure the safe passage of the train.

--- Document Chunk 1384 ---
The interlocking may also have a function which 

--- Document Chunk 1385 ---
permits individual portions of the route to be 

--- Document Chunk 1386 ---
unlocked as soon as possible after the train has 

--- Document Chunk 1387 ---
passed, rather than having to wait until the train 

--- Document Chunk 1388 ---
has passed through the whole route. This is 

--- Document Chunk 1389 ---
known as ‘sectional route release’. As the train 

--- Document Chunk 1390 ---
passes clear of each train detection section 

--- Document Chunk 1391 ---
in the route, the locking on that section is 

--- Document Chunk 1392 ---
released, provided that:

--- Document Chunk 1393 ---
• The entrance signal has returned to 

--- Document Chunk 1394 ---
‘stop’ (danger).

--- Document Chunk 1395 ---
Interlocking design is 

--- Document Chunk 1396 ---
based on the avoidance 

--- Document Chunk 1397 ---
of conflicting routes, 

--- Document Chunk 1398 ---
allowing for a wide 

--- Document Chunk 1399 ---
range of combinations of 

--- Document Chunk 1400 ---
possible events.

--- Document Chunk 1413 ---
• The route request has been cancelled (either 

--- Document Chunk 1414 ---
by the signaller or by TORR).

--- Document Chunk 1415 ---
• All the route locking from the entrance 

--- Document Chunk 1416 ---
signal up to the start of the section has 

--- Document Chunk 1417 ---
already been released.

--- Document Chunk 1418 ---
Route locking ahead of the train continues to 

--- Document Chunk 1419 ---
be maintained. 

--- Document Chunk 1420 ---
Approach Locking

--- Document Chunk 1421 ---
There is a further category of route release, 

--- Document Chunk 1422 ---
applicable only where the route has to be 

--- Document Chunk 1423 ---
cancelled before the train passes the entrance 

--- Document Chunk 1424 ---
signal. Clearly this is an unusual set of 

--- Document Chunk 1425 ---
circumstances – for instance if the signaller needs 

--- Document Chunk 1426 ---
to change the order of two trains at a junction 

--- Document Chunk 1427 ---
after the route has been set for one of them, or if 

--- Document Chunk 1428 ---
there is an emergency and it is necessary to try to 

--- Document Chunk 1429 ---
stop the train. In such circumstances the signaller 

--- Document Chunk 1430 ---
cancels the route on the control panel/desk, 

--- Document Chunk 1431 ---
which has the effect of setting the entrance signal 

--- Document Chunk 1432 ---
to stop (danger). This action does not necessarily 

--- Document Chunk 1433 ---
immediately release the route locking ahead of 

--- Document Chunk 1434 ---
the entrance signal, however, in case the train 

--- Document Chunk 1435 ---
cannot brake sufficiently to stop at the signal and 

--- Document Chunk 1436 ---
consequently enters the route beyond it.

--- Document Chunk 1437 ---
The interlocking function that determines when 

--- Document Chunk 1438 ---
the route locking ahead of the entrance signal is 

--- Document Chunk 1439 ---
released in the circumstances described above 

--- Document Chunk 1440 ---
is known as ‘approach locking’. In its more 

--- Document Chunk 1441 ---
comprehensive form, it maintains the locking of 

--- Document Chunk 1442 ---
the route ahead of the entrance signal (which is 

--- Document Chunk 1443 ---
displaying stop/danger) until one of the following 

--- Document Chunk 1444 ---
conditions is satisfied:

--- Document Chunk 1445 ---
• The train has come to a stand at or 

--- Document Chunk 1446 ---
before the signal, or

--- Document Chunk 1447 ---
• The train has sufficient braking distance to 

--- Document Chunk 1448 ---
come to a stand at or before the signal.

--- Document Chunk 1449 ---
With lineside signalling the first of these conditions 

--- Document Chunk 1450 ---
is usually achieved by using a timer in the 

--- Document Chunk 1451 ---
interlocking, rather than directly confirming the 

--- Document Chunk 1452 ---
train is at a standstill. When it has finished timing, 

--- Document Chunk 1453 ---
the train is assumed to either have come to a 

--- Document Chunk 1454 ---
stand at the signal or to have passed it, being 

--- Document Chunk 1455 ---
unable to stop in time (in the latter case the 

--- Document Chunk 1456 ---
route locking holds the route safe for the train). 

--- Document Chunk 1457 ---
The second condition consists of a check by the 

--- Document Chunk 1458 ---
interlocking that the train has not yet occupied 

--- Document Chunk 1459 ---
any of the train detection sections between 

--- Document Chunk 1460 ---
the sighting point of the first signal displaying a 

--- Document Chunk 1461 ---
caution aspect and the entrance signal displaying 

--- Document Chunk 1462 ---
stop. With cab signalling, the speed and location 

--- Document Chunk 1463 ---
of the train are usually known and can be used 

--- Document Chunk 1464 ---
to check the two conditions, which is a more 

--- Document Chunk 1465 ---
accurate method of checking whether the 

--- Document Chunk 1466 ---
conditions are fulfilled.

--- Document Chunk 1467 ---
Releasing the overlap

--- Document Chunk 1468 ---
If the exit signal is at danger (stop), and the train 

--- Document Chunk 1469 ---
has safely stopped at it, then it is necessary to 

--- Document Chunk 1470 ---
release the locking of any points in the overlap 

--- Document Chunk 1471 ---
beyond the signal. The reason for this is that 

--- Document Chunk 1472 ---
the points may either not be set correctly for 

--- Document Chunk 1473 ---
the train’s onward route, or because another 

--- Document Chunk 1474 ---
train needs to use some of the track and points 

--- Document Chunk 1475 ---
in the overlap.

--- Document Chunk 1476 ---
With lineside signalling, the interlocking times 

--- Document Chunk 1477 ---
the train’s occupancy of the last train detection 

--- Document Chunk 1478 ---
section on the approach to the signal. When 

--- Document Chunk 1479 ---
the timer finishes, and provided that the train 

--- Document Chunk 1480 ---
detection section immediately beyond the 

--- Document Chunk 1481 ---
signal has not been occupied, the interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 1482 ---
will release the points in the overlap. With cab 

--- Document Chunk 1483 ---
signalling, the speed and location of the train are 

--- Document Chunk 1484 ---
usually known and can be used directly to check 

--- Document Chunk 1485 ---
the train is at a standstill at the signal. 

--- Document Chunk 1486 ---
When the interlocking determines that the train 

--- Document Chunk 1487 ---
is stationary at the exit signal, the locking of the 

--- Document Chunk 1488 ---
overlap is released and the track and points in it 

--- Document Chunk 1489 ---
can be used for setting the onward route, or for 

--- Document Chunk 1490 ---
routing other trains. 

--- Document Chunk 1491 ---
Other interlocking functions

--- Document Chunk 1492 ---
This article describes only the basic interlocking 

--- Document Chunk 1493 ---
functionality of a signalling system. There are, 

--- Document Chunk 1494 ---
of course, many other functions that may 

--- Document Chunk 1495 ---
feature, including:

--- Document Chunk 1496 ---
• The role of the interlocking in displaying 

--- Document Chunk 1497 ---
speed information via lineside signals. 

--- Document Chunk 1498 ---
This is of particular importance on ‘speed 

--- Document Chunk 1499 ---
signalled’ railways, as distinct from ‘route 

--- Document Chunk 1500 ---
signalled’ railways.

--- Document Chunk 1501 ---
• Interlocking the signalling system 

--- Document Chunk 1502 ---
with protection systems for personnel 

--- Document Chunk 1503 ---
working on the track.

--- Document Chunk 1504 ---
Interlocking design has 

--- Document Chunk 1505 ---
to consider many factors 

--- Document Chunk 1506 ---
including the speed of the 

--- Document Chunk 1507 ---
trains using the railway 

--- Document Chunk 1508 ---
and interfaces to other 

--- Document Chunk 1509 ---
equipment such as level 

--- Document Chunk 1510 ---
crossings.

Assumes  

--- Document Chunk 1590 ---
• M odern Network Rail practice, including: 

--- Document Chunk 1591 ---
 TPWS train protection designed to stop train within overlap length 

--- Document Chunk 1592 ---
 Route locking incorporates track bob protection  

--- Document Chunk 1593 ---
• Sufficient standage in the loops that the longest trains may pass; 

--- Document Chunk 1594 ---
therefore special controls are not necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 1595 ---
• No special controls relating to the method of single line working are 

--- Document Chunk 1596 ---
necessary (method is unspecified on the plan but would appear not to be 

--- Document Chunk 1597 ---
Track Circuit Block, Token Block nor One Train Working- No Staff).

• The provision of train protection systems (which will be 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
covered in another ‘Back to Basics’ article, soon to be 

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
published in IRSE News).

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
• Interlocking with level crossings or other moveable 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
infrastructure (e.g. swing bridges).

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
Specifying interlocking requirements

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
The process for specifying the interlocking requirements 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
for a particular track layout is strictly governed by railway 

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
administrations (or in some cases their regulatory bodies), 

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
because of the safety implications of an error.

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
Ideally, the starting point for the signal engineer is to be 

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
provided with details of the proposed track layout and the 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
operational requirements. The first of these includes knowledge 

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
of the location of points and associated critical dimensions. 

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
The operational requirements include the frequency of trains, 

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
their maximum speeds and braking capabilities, the required 

--- Document Chunk 1649 ---
headways and the specific train movements (main line, 

--- Document Chunk 1650 ---
shunting, permissive etc). 

--- Document Chunk 1651 ---
In practice, this ideal starting point is not always the reality! 

--- Document Chunk 1652 ---
Signal engineers may, for instance be told to replicate the 

--- Document Chunk 1653 ---
existing signalling arrangements in modern form (which is itself 

--- Document Chunk 1654 ---
an ambiguous statement), without being given any explicit 

--- Document Chunk 1655 ---
statement of operational requirements.

--- Document Chunk 1656 ---
The signal engineer also needs to know the signalling principles 

--- Document Chunk 1657 ---
applicable to the railway for which the design is being prepared. 

--- Document Chunk 1658 ---
These are the high-level generic rules for ensuring the safe 

--- Document Chunk 1659 ---
movement of trains, and they cover all the requirements relating 

--- Document Chunk 1660 ---
to route setting, locking and release – and more. 

--- Document Chunk 1661 ---
The knowledge of the track layout, the operational 

--- Document Chunk 1662 ---
requirements and the signalling principles enables the signal 

--- Document Chunk 1663 ---
engineer to produce two key sets of documents. The first is the 

--- Document Chunk 1664 ---
Scheme Plan, and the second are the Control Tables.

--- Document Chunk 1665 ---
Scheme Plan

--- Document Chunk 1666 ---
The Scheme Plan depicts the layout of the track, showing 

--- Document Chunk 1667 ---
points, signals, train detection sections, level crossings, stations, 

--- Document Chunk 1668 ---
permissible speeds etc. Each track is usually shown as a single 

--- Document Chunk 1669 ---
line, not a pair of lines. Each signalling object is allocated a 

--- Document Chunk 1670 ---
unique identity (numbers and/or letters). The plan also shows 

--- Document Chunk 1671 ---
the routes that each train can take from each signal. Each route 

--- Document Chunk 1672 ---
is given a unique identity. Other relevant information may also 

--- Document Chunk 1673 ---
be shown on, or be associated with, the Scheme Plan. A simple 

--- Document Chunk 1674 ---
Scheme Plan is shown in Figure 1, for a single line with a passing 

--- Document Chunk 1675 ---
loop at a station. The symbols shown are used by many railways 

--- Document Chunk 1676 ---
around the world, but are not universal. 

--- Document Chunk 1677 ---
Control Tables

--- Document Chunk 1678 ---
The Control Tables state all the conditions that must be 

--- Document Chunk 1679 ---
fulfilled for each route before a train can be given a movement 

--- Document Chunk 1680 ---
authority to use it. The route information is derived from 

--- Document Chunk 1681 ---
the Scheme Plan– the position of points, the train detection 

--- Document Chunk 1682 ---
sections that must be clear, other routes that must not be set 

--- Document Chunk 1683 ---
etc. Approach locking release conditions are also specified, as 

--- Document Chunk 1684 ---
are requirements for functions such as the delayed clearance 

--- Document Chunk 1685 ---
of signals at diverging junctions, and the aspect sequence 

--- Document Chunk 1686 ---
for successive signals. A simple example of a signal/route 

--- Document Chunk 1687 ---
control table is shown in Figure 2, for a route from signal B12 

--- Document Chunk 1688 ---
to B11 on the Plan in Figure 1. The requirements are based on 

--- Document Chunk 1689 ---
current British (Network Rail) signalling practice and include 

--- Document Chunk 1690 ---
some features (such as train protection proving and technician 

--- Document Chunk 1691 ---
controls) that we have not dealt with in this article.

--- Document Chunk 1692 ---
Control Tables are also prepared for each set of points, stating 

--- Document Chunk 1693 ---
the conditions that must be fulfilled before a set of points is free 

--- Document Chunk 1694 ---
to move. This includes the routes that require the points to be 

--- Document Chunk 1695 ---
normal or reverse, dead-locking train detection sections and 

--- Document Chunk 1696 ---
point-to-point locking.

--- Document Chunk 1697 ---
It is in the preparation of the Control Tables that the signal 

--- Document Chunk 1698 ---
engineer’s knowledge of the signalling principles and 

--- Document Chunk 1699 ---
application rules is of vital importance. From the Control 

--- Document Chunk 1700 ---
Tables, the circuit diagrams for relay interlockings (based on 

--- Document Chunk 1701 ---
standard circuits) can be produced, or the data in the case of a 

--- Document Chunk 1702 ---
computer-based interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 1703 ---
The production of the Control Tables is, therefore, a critical 

--- Document Chunk 1704 ---
step in the design and configuration of the interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 1705 ---
Nevertheless, the gradual automation of the design process 

--- Document Chunk 1706 ---
means that it is possible to go directly from Scheme Plan to 

--- Document Chunk 1707 ---
detailed design, with the Control Tables being a by-product 

--- Document Chunk 1708 ---
of the process for later use (e.g. for recording tests performed 

--- Document Chunk 1709 ---
on the interlocking), rather than being a key stage in the 

--- Document Chunk 1710 ---
design process. 

--- Document Chunk 1711 ---
Closing remarks

--- Document Chunk 1712 ---
This article and last month’s have provided an introduction to 

--- Document Chunk 1713 ---
railway interlocking – and if you want to know more, some of 

--- Document Chunk 1714 ---
the IRSE textbooks cover the subject in greater detail. For many 

--- Document Chunk 1715 ---
signal engineers the specification and design of interlockings is 

--- Document Chunk 1716 ---
at the heart of their careers. It requires knowledge, experience 

--- Document Chunk 1717 ---
and expertise – and it is vital to the safety of the railway. But if 

--- Document Chunk 1718 ---
you are new to the industry, don’t let that deter you. Instead, 

--- Document Chunk 1719 ---
take every opportunity to learn from those who have the 

--- Document Chunk 1720 ---
experience and knowledge.

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
However functional 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
and complex the 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
interlocking is, it’s 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
important to ensure 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
that the information 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
relayed to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
is clear and easily 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
understood, as an 

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
aspect indicating safe 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
speed (left) or route 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
based signalling.
