Back to basics: SIL explained

--- Document Chunk 3 ---
Safety Integrity Level (SIL) is an 

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
indicator of the relative risk-

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
reduction provided by a safety 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
function in a device. A SIL number 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
between 1 and 4 (SIL 1 being the 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
lowest level of safety protection and 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
SIL 4 the highest) is used to describe 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
the degree of safety protection 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
required and the safety reliability of 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
a system which is needed to achieve 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
that protection. It should be noted 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
that safety reliability is not the same 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
as performance reliability, as this 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
back-to-basics article will explain. 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
For traditional hardware‑based 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
systems, safety is typically specified 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
and demonstrated in terms of Mean 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
Time Between Wrong Side Failure 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
(MTBWSF), which can be calculated 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
from the observed random failure rates 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
of the individual components. When 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
programmable systems began to be 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
used in safety critical applications, 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
duplicated or triplicated system 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
architectures were adopted to give very 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
high MTBWSF as a result of random 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
hardware failures. But what about failure 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
of the software embedded in these 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
systems? Software failures may appear 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
to be random, but in fact they are always 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
systematic; if the circumstances are 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
repeated the result will be the same. This 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
means that any attempt to predict safety 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
from observed failure rates of the system 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
is futile – a small change in operating 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
circumstances can reveal or hide a latent 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
defect in the software.

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
The solution is to recognise that the 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
hazardous failure rate as a result of 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
these ‘systematic failures’ cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
quantified, and instead it is necessary 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
to demonstrate safety by means of 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
the rigour of the design and validation 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
process for the system and the software. 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
This is inevitably a qualitative (as 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
opposed to a quantitative) approach and 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
the SIL system provides an internationally 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
recognised approach to managing this 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
issue for safety critical systems.

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
The concept of SIL originated in 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
the International Electrotechnical 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
Committee standard IEC 61508: 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
Functional Safety of Electrical/

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
Electronic/Programmable Electronic 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
Safety‑related Systems. IEC 61508 is 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
not railway specific and applies to all 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
safety engineering disciplines. For the rail 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
industry CENELEC (European Committee 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
for Electrotechnical Standardisation) 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
derived the following standards 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
from IEC 61508 to meet railway 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
specific requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
• EN 50126: The specification 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
and demonstration of Reliability, 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
Availability, Maintainability 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
and Safety (RAMS).

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
• EN 50128: Railway applications 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
– Communication, signalling 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
and processing systems – 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
Software for railway control and 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
protection systems. 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
• EN 50129: Railway applications 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
– Communication, signalling and 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---

--- Document Chunk 77 ---

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
Safety Integrity Levels can be assigned to 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
virtually any function presenting a safety 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
risk. Typical examples of SIL functions 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
for rail are: SIL 1 light metro train speed 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
monitoring and display, SIL 2 monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
of axle box bearing temperature, SIL 3 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
depot protection, SIL 4 interlocking of 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
points and signals. The allocation of SIL

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
takes into account the frequency and severity of the risk that 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
is being managed, and whether there are other systems or 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
manual processes that can mitigate the effect of a hazardous 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
system failure.

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
When developing systems to a required SIL, techniques are 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
selected from a list of recommended or mandatory techniques 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
dependent upon the level of SIL. For example, when creating 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
the software requirements specification for a SIL 4 system the 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
techniques include: formal methods, modelling, structured 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
methodology, and decision tables.

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
A common misconception is that individual products or 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
components have SIL ratings. But simply buying a SIL suitable 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
component (if possible) does not ensure a SIL system. Rather, 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
products and components may be suitable for use within a 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
given SIL system, but they are not individually SIL rated. 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
SIL levels apply to safety functions and safety systems, and 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
products and components are only suitable for use in specific 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
SIL applications if the end user can ensure that the overall 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
safety system is implemented correctly. The equipment 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
or system must also be operated and used in the way it 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
was designed in order to achieve the required safety risk 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
reduction level.

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
The owner/operator must determine the acceptable level of 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
risk, based on standards or other factors such as ALARP and 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
society acceptance of the risk. A risk level that one owner 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
determines is tolerable may be unacceptable to another. 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
Unfortunately, the requirements for a given SIL are not 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
consistent among all of the functional safety standards across 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
different industries, which does cause some confusion. 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
Some asset owners and project managers may be tempted 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
to specify a high SIL simply for availability reasons, and SIL 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
is sometimes mistakenly used to imply that a product has 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
better quality and higher reliability, but this is incorrect. Some 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
products may be described as ‘SIL rated’, suggesting that they 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
are suitable for use in safety systems, but this depends on 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
many other aspects of the overall system design. Even when 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
a product genuinely complies with SIL requirements, this only 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
provides assurance that it is capable of performing a specific 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
role within a safety system. Its safety reliability may be high, but 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
its general reliability may not be. 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
An item is highly available if it does not fail very often and, 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
when it does, it can be quickly returned to service. A system 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
is considered to be safe if it is reliably performing its safety 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
function. However, the system may fail much more frequently 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
in ways that are considered not to be dangerous (fail safe). 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
Therefore, a safety system may be less reliable overall (i.e. with 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
a lower mean time between failures) than a non‑safety system 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
performing a similar function. 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
Selecting the appropriate SIL level must be done carefully. 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
Whole life costs are generally considerably higher in order to 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
achieve higher SIL levels. This is because designing, testing 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
and maintaining systems to meet high levels of safety integrity 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
is complicated, time‑consuming and expensive, and can lead 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
to lower levels of overall system performance reliability which 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
has cost implications. It can also be an obstacle to future 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
enhancements of the system to meet new requirements and 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
operational circumstances.

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
For example, some industries outside of rail with a lower safety 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
risk requirement (for example factory production) companies 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
will typically accept designs up to SIL 2. If an assessment 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
indicates a requirement for a higher SIL, owners will usually 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
require the redesign of the process to lower the intrinsic 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
process risk, rather than design the system to achieve SIL 3.

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
In modern railway signalling systems the use of SIL 4 is 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
usually restricted to those parts of the signalling which are 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
safety critical, for example the interlocking. Other parts of the 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
signalling system, such as the control panel or workstation, are 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
usually of a lower SIL value (typically SIL 0 to SIL 2). Network 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
Rail in the UK has recently reviewed its standards to determine 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
where the SIL 4 interlocking could be simplified by deploying 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
lower SIL functions in another part of the system.

A complex railway system will typically employ systems with different

SIL levels. Interlocking, train absence detection and automatic train 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
protection for example may be SIL 4 systems, whilst the automatic 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
train operation and control centre systems may be configured to 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
meet the failure rates of SIL 2.
