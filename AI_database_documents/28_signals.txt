Back to basics

--- Document Chunk 4 ---
In this article in our “Back to basics” 

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
series we look at lineside railway 

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
signals. Signals are referred to 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
frequently in other "Back to basics" 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
articles, but without exploring the 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
subject in detail.

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
Movement authorities

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
Trains and train drivers need to be 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
provided with information telling them 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
when to move, and where and when to 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
stop. The generic term for information 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
that permits a train to move onto a 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
section of line is ‘movement authority’. 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
Although railways vary enormously 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
in how they operate, almost all rely 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
on one of three means by which 

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
movement authority information is 

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
given to the train:

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
Verbal instructions given to the train 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
driver to proceed to a designated 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
location on the line ahead. The 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
instruction is usually issued via a train 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
radio system by a person in the control 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
(dispatching) centre or similar location, 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
such as a signal box. These types of 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
systems are often used on low-capacity 

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
lines (sometimes referred to as ‘dark 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
territory’) where a costly signalling 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
system cannot be justified. For more 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
information about these systems and 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
their more modern equivalents, you 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
should read Robert Baird’s Back to basics 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
article on Low-Cost Electronic Authority 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
Systems in issue 282 of IRSE News 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
(November 2021) irse.info/irsenews282 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
Railways also use verbal instructions to 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
drivers when the normal lineside or cab 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
signalling system has failed.

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
Lineside signals (also called wayside 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
signals), which comprise arrangements 

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
of visual symbols (coloured lights, 

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
mechanical devices, signs) positioned 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
at pre-determined locations at the 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
trackside for the driver to see and 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
react to in the required manner. In the 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
early days of railways lineside signals 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
were mainly mechanically operated 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
semaphores, and although many 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
examples of such signalling can still be 

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
found around the world, all modern 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
systems use colour light signals, which 

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
superficially look like road traffic 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
lights/signals. This article focuses 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
predominantly on lineside signals.

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
Cab signalling, where the movement 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
authority information is displayed in the 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
driving cab, rather than at the lineside. 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
We will briefly consider cab signalling to 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
understand how the provision of in-cab 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
information compares with lineside 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
signals. However, a full exploration 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
of the topic, which includes systems 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
such as Communications-Based Train 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
Control (CBTC), the European Train 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
Control System (ETCS) and Positive Train 

--- Document Chunk 69 ---
Control (PTC), is well beyond the scope 

--- Document Chunk 70 ---
of this article. 

--- Document Chunk 71 ---
So, we are talking mostly about lineside 

--- Document Chunk 72 ---
colour light signals, the information they 

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
convey, and how to ensure that train 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
drivers can see the signals and respond 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
to them appropriately. However, we 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
are not going to explore all the types 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
of signals used in different parts of the 

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
world – a whole book could be written 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
about that! Nor are we discussing the 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
decision-making technology which 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
enables a signal to display movement 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
authority information to a driver. That 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
topic is covered in two Back to basics 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
articles about Interlocking – see issues 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
Why do railways need signals?

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
When you drive a road vehicle, you are 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
‘driving on sight’. You are responsible 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
for observing the road ahead and other 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
nearby traffic and making decisions 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
accordingly. You choose which route 

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
to take at junctions, maintain a safe 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
distance from any vehicle you can 

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
see ahead of you, and you slow down 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
when you see the need to do so. If you 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
can see that a collision may be about 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
to occur, you can try to take avoiding 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
action by emergency braking and by 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
steering the vehicle. Although traffic 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
lights (road signals) are provided at some 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
road junctions, most have no signals and 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
safety is dependent solely on all drivers 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
complying with a set of rules.

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
Railways are quite unlike roads. It is 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
not possible to steer a train; it will go 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
wherever the rails and points (switches) 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
take it. A train cannot be stopped 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
quickly; a passenger train travelling at 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
200km/h will have a typical braking 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
distance of over 2.5km. So, except 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
for very low speed railways such as 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
tramways, driving a train is not a ‘drive 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
on sight’ operation. 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
To maintain safety in this very different 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
operational environment, railway tracks 

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
are divided into ‘block’ sections, and 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
normally only one train is allowed to be 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
in each block section at any one time. A 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
block section may be quite long (several 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
kilometres), or very short (a couple of 

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
hundred metres or less, particularly on 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
metros). Each block section may be 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
plain line, or it may have points in the 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
route; and in some cases trains may 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
be permitted to travel through it in 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
either direction. 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
The driver of a train at the start of a 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
block section may not be able to see 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
all the track that comprises the section 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
ahead. They cannot be sure whether 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
points in the block section are set and 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
locked correctly, nor know with certainty 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
the movements of other trains already 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
in (or approaching) the same block 

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
section. Because the driver cannot know 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
if it is safe to proceed, a 'block' signal 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
is positioned at the start of each block 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
section to provide that information. 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
An approaching train must stop at the 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
signal unless it displays an indication to 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
proceed. The signal is operated from the 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
control centre via an interlocking, and 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
it will display a proceed indication only 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
when the block section is set and locked 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
for the train, with no other conflicting 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
train movements. The driver can then 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
move the train through the block section 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
to the signal that marks the start of the 

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
next section. If everything is working to 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
plan (the timetable), train drivers should 

--- Document Chunk 160 ---
only infrequently encounter signals 

--- Document Chunk 161 ---
displaying ‘stop’, thereby minimising 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
journey times and making maximum use 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
of the line capacity.

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
Because a train takes a considerable 

--- Document Chunk 165 ---
distance to stop, a signal displaying 

--- Document Chunk 166 ---
‘stop’ may not be visible to the driver at 

--- Document Chunk 167 ---
the location where they need to start 

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
slowing down. To ensure the driver is 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
given adequate advance information and 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
can brake appropriately, one or more 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
‘distant’ signals (also sometimes called 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
'approach' signals) are provided on the 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
approach to each signal that can display 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
a stop indication. 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
The distance from the first of these 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
signals to the stop signal will be the 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
longest braking distance (under normal 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
adhesion conditions) of all the trains 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
that are authorised to use the line, plus a

margin for safety. If a signal is displaying 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
stop, the preceding distant signal(s) will 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
display appropriate ‘caution’ information 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
to warn the driver of the need to slow 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
down and be prepared to stop at a signal 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
further ahead. If a signal is displaying 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
‘proceed’ (rather than stop) then the 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
preceding distant signal(s) will display 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
information to tell the driver that there 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
is no need to slow down. These two 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
scenarios are shown in Figure 2.

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
On routes where the traffic density is 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
higher, every signal may be capable of 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
displaying ‘proceed’, ‘caution, prepare to 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
stop at next signal ahead’ and ‘stop’, and 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
a block section is simply the portion of 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
track between one signal and the next, 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
equal in length to the braking distance 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
(plus a margin). This is shown in Figure 3.

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
On very busy railways, the block sections 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
may be made shorter than full braking 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
distance to further improve capacity 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
(by reducing the headway). In such 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
cases, more than one preceding signal 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
will display a ‘caution’ indication on 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
the approach to a signal displaying 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
stop, with full braking distance from 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
the first of these signals to the stop 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
signal – see Figure 4 for an example. 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
The aspects of the signals at caution 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
(9 and 11) are usually different from each 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
other, to avoid misleading the driver as 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
to which signal ahead is displaying a 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
stop indication.

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
Signal engineers, railway operators 

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
and train drivers use the word ‘aspect’ 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
in association with signals, by which 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
we mean all the information that is 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
presented by a signal to the driver at a 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
particular time, such as stop, proceed, 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
and ‘caution, prepare to stop at a signal 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
further ahead’. 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
The aspects displayed by successive 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
signals that a driver encounters is called 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
an ‘aspect sequence’. 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
How driving information is 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
conveyed by lineside signals

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
In accordance with international 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
technical standard UIC 732, most 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
railways use the colour red for signals 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
displaying a stop aspect (sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
called a ‘danger’ aspect); green for 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
‘proceed’ (often called a ‘clear’ aspect); 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
and yellow for ‘caution’ (sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
called an ‘approach’ aspect). See Figure 5 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
for an example of an aspect sequence 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
using these colours.

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
A signal may also provide additional 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
information for the driver, most 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
importantly for diverging junctions 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
where the train needs to slow down 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
to traverse the points safely. There 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
are basically two different ways in 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
which this is done.

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
Most of the world’s lineside signalled 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
railways use ‘speed signalling systems’, 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
whereby the signals tell a driver how fast 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
to proceed on the approach to diverging 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
junctions and, in some systems, when 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
approaching a signal showing a stop 

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
aspect. However, there is generally little 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
or no information provided about which 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
route is set for the train at a junction.

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
By way of an example, the Dutch speed 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
signalling system, which is based on 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
USA practices, uses three basic aspects 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
(red, yellow and green), supplemented 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
where required by illuminated numeric 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
indicators which tell the driver of a 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
speed limit ahead; for instance, ‘8’ to 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
indicate a maximum speed of 80km/h 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
– see Figure 6.

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
Some other speed systems use 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
combinations of colour lights to indicate 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
speed limits, rather than displaying 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
a number. For instance, the Italian 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
national railway uses two lights displayed 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
vertically (yellow over green) to warn the 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
driver of the speed limit over a junction 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
ahead that is set for the diverging route. 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
In the example shown in Figure 7, the 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
yellow/green aspect tells the driver 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
that the junction ahead is set and must 

--- Document Chunk 289 ---
be traversed at a speed not exceeding 

--- Document Chunk 290 ---
30km/h. For higher speed turnouts 

--- Document Chunk 291 ---
(60km/h and 100km/h), flashing yellow 

--- Document Chunk 292 ---
over green lights are used.

Although speed signalling predominates, 

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
some countries (including Britain and 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
other countries that have systems based 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
on British practice) use an alternative 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
called ‘route signalling’. Information is 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
provided at signals that protect diverging 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
junctions to tell the driver which route is 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
set for the train. The driver is expected to 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
know the prevailing speed for the route 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
set, and when to start braking to traverse 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
the junction safely. The signals provide 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
no information about speed limits 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
over junctions. 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
The route information may take the form 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
of a junction indicator (a ‘bar’ of white 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
lights set at an angle corresponding to 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
the route set, usually mounted above 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
the main signal, see the centre photo in 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
Figure 1); or an illuminated alphanumeric 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
character may be displayed above or 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
alongside the main signal to indicate the 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
route set; or, less commonly, a pair of 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
signals may be provided alongside each 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
other, one for the straight route and one 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
for the diverging route. The one for the 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
route set displays the appropriate aspect 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
to allow the train to proceed over the 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
junction, while the other remains at red. 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
To reduce the risk of a driver 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
inadvertently traversing a diverging 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
junction too fast on a route-signalled 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
railway, which could result in derailment, 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
‘approach release’ (also known as 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
‘approach control’) of junction signals 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
is employed. This typically involves 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
holding the junction signal at ‘stop’ with 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
the preceding signal(s) displaying the 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
corresponding caution aspect(s) until 

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
the train has slowed and the driver can 

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
clearly see the junction signal ahead, 

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
at which point the interlocking allows 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
the signal to display the appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
aspect and route indication for the train 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
to proceed over the junction. At some 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
high-speed junctions in Britain the 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
junction signal may initially be held at 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
‘caution’ (single yellow) with the junction 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
indicator displayed, and the preceding 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
signal(s) display flashing yellow aspects 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
to warn of the need to slow down for 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
the diverging route. 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
Although signalling systems can be 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
classified broadly as ‘route’ or ‘speed’ 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
in type, some speed signalling systems 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
include some features of route 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
signalling, and to a limited extent vice-

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
versa. For example, the Italian speed 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
system referred to earlier includes both 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
speed and (limited) route information in 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
the signal aspects on the approach to 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
a diverging junction. Furthermore, not 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
only do some countries have more than 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
one type of speed or route signalling, a 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
few (notably the USA and Australia) use 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
route signalling on some railways and 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
speed signalling on others. Wikipedia 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
provides a useful summary of the signal 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
aspects used in various Australian states. 

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
irse.info/idkn9

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
Fixed lineside speed reminder signs may 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
be provided with both route and speed 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
systems. This is arguably more important 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
with route signalling than speed 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
signalling, although it in no way replaces 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
or lessens the need for route knowledge. 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
The IRSE’s textbook “European Railway 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
Signalling” provides information about 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
the many different systems of signal 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
aspects used by European railway 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
administrations. It illustrates well 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
just how much they vary from one 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
country to another. 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
The driver’s perspective

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
Having considered the information 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
provided by lineside signals to drive a 

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
train safely, we will now think about how 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
to ensure that each signal displays the 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
information in a manner that drivers can 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
assimilate and use.

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
Good practice for signal visibility is 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
based on the needs of the driver. On 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
approaching a signal, a driver has 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
Figure 5 – A typical sequence of successive signals corresponding to 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
Figure 3, displaying 'proceed', 'caution, prepare to stop at next signal 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
ahead' and 'stop' (green, yellow and red respectively).

--- Document Chunk 419 ---
Figure 6 – An example of a Netherlands railway signal,  

--- Document Chunk 420 ---
instructing the driver to reduce speed to 80km/h before  

--- Document Chunk 421 ---
reaching the next signal ahead.

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
Figure 7 – An example of Italian speed signalling, where the diverging route is set and must be traversed at no 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
more than 30km/h. The red over green (proceed) aspect displayed by the junction signal confirms to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
that the diverging route is set and that the next signal ahead is also displaying a proceed aspect.

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
firstly to read the signal (observe the 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
information displayed), then interpret the 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
aspect (understand what it means), and 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
then drive the train accordingly.

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
Reading a signal requires that:

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
1. It is clearly applicable to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
of an approaching train, and readily 

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
distinguishable from any other signals 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
in the vicinity (for instance, other 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
adjacent signals, and signals further 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
ahead on the line).

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
2. All the illumina ted lights that 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
comprise the aspect displayed are 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
clearly visible for a sufficient length 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
of time for the driver to observe 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
the aspect, taking into account the 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
highest attainable or permissible 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
approach speed.

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
3. It is visible under all conditions 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
and at all times of day and night, 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
including those where sunlight or 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
nearby artificial lighting might make 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
readability difficult.

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
Interpreting a signal requires that:

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
1. The aspect displayed is one o f an 

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
established set of aspects applicable 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
to the railway, with a clearly defined 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
meaning for drivers. 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
2. The in formation conveyed by the 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
aspect is unambiguous, so that the 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
driver is not placed in a position of 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
uncertainty as to what action to take; 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
nor be ‘conditioned’ by previous 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
driving experience to expect to take 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
a particular course of action, only to 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
find on rare occasions that a different 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
action is required even though the 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
aspect displayed is the same.

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
3. The aspect is not corrupted (all 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
relevant lights illuminated, and no 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
others), to avoid the driver either 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
not understanding the information 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
presented or interpreting it as having 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
a different meaning to that intended 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
by the signalling system.

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
When the driver has read and interpreted 

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
a signal, they then decide on what action 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
to take, making use of their knowledge 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
of the rolling stock, the route ahead and 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
the applicable operational rules.

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
Driveability of the signal requires that:

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
1. The aspect f orms part of a logical 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
aspect sequence encountered by the 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
driver, except of course in emergency 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
or failure conditions, for instance if 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
a signal reverts to red to stop a train 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
because of an unexpected unsafe 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
condition ahead.

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
2. Wher e the aspect requires the 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
driver to reduce speed, it must be 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
possible to meet the speed reduction 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
requirement by means of normal 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
(service) braking, taking into account 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
factors such as the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
attainable/permissible speed on the 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
approach to the signal, rolling stock 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
performance and braking capability, 

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
gradients and distance to next signal.

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
Train drivers need a wide range of information to do their 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
job, of which signals are only one part. The information and 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
knowledge they require includes:

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
• Route and infrastructure information (commonly known 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
as ‘route knowledge’), including the locations (and 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
layouts) of junctions, stations, lineside signals, permitted 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
speeds and gradients. This information is relatively 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
static, with occasional changes when the infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
manager alters track layouts and signalling.

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
• Rolling stock information, including the train’s maximum 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
speed, braking capability and length. This information 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
is particular to each type of train, and some of it (such 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
as length and braking capability), may be particular to 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
each individual train trip – particularly in the case of 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
freight trains.

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
• Timetable information, telling the driver about planned 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
departure, passing and arrival times at specific locations. 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
• Driving rules for driving the train safely under normal 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
operational conditions, in degraded modes and in 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
emergency situations; and for activities such as those 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
associated with arrival/departure from stations (passenger 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
trains) and loading/unloading operations (freight trains).

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
• Movement authorities. The driver must know the 

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
meaning of the information displayed by lineside 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
signals (or the in-cab display), and how to respond to 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
that information.

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
In the case of a metro, the operation of all the trains using 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
any one line is more or less identical and driving is a relatively 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
straightforward task, particularly if the trains are fitted with 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
automatic train protection and operation (ATP, ATO). At the 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
other extreme, the manual driving of long and heavy freight 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
trains, where each one may have different characteristics, is 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
much more complex.

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
The knowledge and information required for train driving

--- Document Chunk 534 ---
3. The in formation displayed is of fairly 

--- Document Chunk 535 ---
immediate relevance to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 536 ---
Displaying information well before 

--- Document Chunk 537 ---
the driver needs to act on it could 

--- Document Chunk 538 ---
risk them forgetting it by the time it 

--- Document Chunk 539 ---
becomes relevant. 

--- Document Chunk 540 ---
Two important corollaries to these 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
requirements are firstly that drivers must 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
meet the relevant eyesight (colour vision 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
and visual acuity) and competence 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
requirements; and secondly that driving 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
cabs should be designed to provide the 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
driver with an optimal view of lineside 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
signals, not only from a distance but also 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
when close to, or stationary at, a signal.

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
Positioning signals

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
It should be clear by now that designing 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
a lineside signalling system requires 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
careful consideration of the train drivers’ 

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
needs. In particular, the locations 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
of signals for optimum viewing and 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
correct driver response are of critical 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
importance. The locations are initially 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
determined by headway and signal 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
spacing calculations, taking account 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
of the topography of the railway 

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
infrastructure (including track layout, 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
gradients and speed limits), operational 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
requirements, the rolling stock that 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
will use the railway, and capacity 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
requirements. Other factors may also 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
need to be considered, such as:

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
• Line curvature and structures (such 

--- Document Chunk 567 ---
as bridges, station infrastructure and 

--- Document Chunk 568 ---
overhead line equipment) that may 

--- Document Chunk 569 ---
impede signal visibility.

--- Document Chunk 570 ---
• Viaducts and tunnels, where it is 

--- Document Chunk 571 ---
inadvisable to place signals unless 

--- Document Chunk 572 ---
unavoidable because of the risks 

--- Document Chunk 573 ---
associated with evacuating a train 

--- Document Chunk 574 ---
in an emergency.

--- Document Chunk 575 ---
• Nearby artificial lighting (on stations, 

--- Document Chunk 576 ---
buildings and roads) which could 

--- Document Chunk 577 ---
impair the clarity with which 

--- Document Chunk 578 ---
signals can be seen.

--- Document Chunk 579 ---
• The effects of sunlight (shining 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
either into the signal or into the 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
driver’s eyes).

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
• The possible consequences of a 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
train passing the signal at danger 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
(stop) – commonly known in Britain 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
and some other countries as a SPAD 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
(Signal Passed At Danger’).

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
The proposed location and light beam 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
alignment of each signal is usually 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
subject to review to ensure that in 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
practice a driver will be able to read the 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
signal aspect reliably and accurately, and 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
that there are no unforeseen hazards 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
associated with the location. 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
This review process, which may involve 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
site visits and/or the use of simulation 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
systems, is known as ‘signal sighting’ 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
(in Britain, at least), and is a joint activity 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
involving signalling designers and train 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
operators. Signal maintainers may also 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
participate so that maintainability issues 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
can be considered and addressed.

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
Where the time for which a signal is 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
visible to a driver is unacceptably short 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
(for example, because of tight curvature 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
on the approach) and it is not possible 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
to place the signal in a better location, 

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
repeater signals are sometimes used, 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
located a short distance before the main 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
signal. As their name implies, they repeat 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
some or all of the information displayed 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
by the main signal to give the driver an 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
extended time to read and interpret 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
the aspect. It should be noted that if 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
the signal is displaying ‘stop’, the driver 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
is expected to stop at the main signal, 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
not the repeater.

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
Countdown marker boards are also 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
sometimes provided on the approach 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
to signals to aid the driver. On some 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
railways this is done routinely; on others 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
it is done only in special circumstances, 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
for instance where the signal 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
sighting time is poor.

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
Most railways have conventions about 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
whether signals are located to the left or 

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
the right of the track, usually dependent 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
on whether, on double track lines, trains 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
are normally on the right-hand or left-

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
hand track in the direction of running. 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
Main signals are usually positioned at 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
or above driver’s eye level, on either 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
posts (masts), cantilever structures or 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
gantries. The latter two are used mostly 

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
on busy routes with several parallel lines 

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
where there may not be room to place 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
individual signal posts between the 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
tracks, see Figure 9.

--- Document Chunk 638 ---

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
On some railways, notably underground 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
metros, there may be insufficient room 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
to place signals in locations that are 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
clear of the swept envelope of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
In such cases, smaller signal heads 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
might be used and/or they might be 

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
positioned near ground level instead 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
of being elevated, where there is 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
more room for them.

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
Lastly on the subject of signal positions, 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
each signal may be assigned an 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
alphanumeric identity that is unique 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
within the area of the control centre. 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
Typically the identity is shown on a 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
plate attached to the signal structure, 

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
and on the signalling display system 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
in the control centre. If a driver and 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
signaller need to speak with each 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
other (by radio or phone) when a train 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
is stationary at a signal, the identity is 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
used to verify the train's location. This is 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
vital for safety, particularly if the signal 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
is displaying 'stop' because of a failure 

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
and the driver has to be given verbal 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
instructions to proceed.

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
Signal head design

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
Signal heads have many different 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
designs. The predominant form is 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
a metal structure within which are 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
separate lamp (bulb) and lens assemblies 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
for each coloured light that the signal 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
requires. Each assembly has an electrical 

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
connection to the signalling system 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
which switches the lamp on or off.

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
Some railways use lamp and lens 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
assemblies that allow multiple colours to 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
be displayed through a single lens, rather 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
than having a separate assembly for each 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
colour. The so-called ‘searchlight’ signal 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
(an electromechanical device) is one 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
example of this. Other types use dichroic 

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
mirrors or colour LEDs.

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
The filament (incandescent) lamps 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
traditionally used for signals are generally 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
low power devices (typically 24W or less) 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
specifically designed for the purpose, 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
in front of which is a lens system, see 

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
Figure 10. This arrangement produces a 

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
very concentrated beam of light that is 

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
visible as much as a kilometre away in 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
good conditions, with a narrow angle 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
of divergence to help ensure that the 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
signal can be seen predominantly by 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
drivers on the line to which it applies 

--- Document Chunk 698 ---
but less so by drivers on other (parallel) 

--- Document Chunk 699 ---
lines. Lens systems can also be wide-

--- Document Chunk 700 ---
angled when necessary to aid viewing 

--- Document Chunk 701 ---
in special circumstances, such as when 

--- Document Chunk 702 ---
approaching on a sharp curve.

--- Document Chunk 703 ---
LED technology has led to a revolution 

--- Document Chunk 704 ---
in railway signals, enabling heads to 

--- Document Chunk 705 ---
be much more compact, lighter and 

--- Document Chunk 706 ---
reliable, with a less complex lens system, 

--- Document Chunk 707 ---
whilst still meeting the requirement 

--- Document Chunk 708 ---
to produce a concentrated beam of 

--- Document Chunk 709 ---
light with beam intensities suitable for 

--- Document Chunk 710 ---
long, medium or short-range viewing. 

--- Document Chunk 711 ---
For these reasons many railways 

--- Document Chunk 712 ---
now use LED signals in preference 

--- Document Chunk 713 ---
to filament lamp types for signalling 

--- Document Chunk 714 ---
schemes and renewals.

--- Document Chunk 715 ---
Although the visibility of a signal from 

--- Document Chunk 716 ---
a distance is of prime importance, a 

--- Document Chunk 717 ---
driver also needs to be able to see the 

--- Document Chunk 718 ---
aspect displayed when stopped close 

--- Document Chunk 719 ---
to the signal. Various techniques are 

--- Document Chunk 720 ---
used to ensure this, including a specially 

--- Document Chunk 721 ---
designed part of the lens which shines 

--- Document Chunk 722 ---
light down towards the driving cab; 

--- Document Chunk 723 ---
using small repeater (or co-acting) 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
signals at cab height for close-up 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
viewing; and requiring drivers to stop a 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
few metres before the signal, where it is 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
clearly visible to them.

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
The visibility of signals can be 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
problematical in locations where at 

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
some times of the day and year the sun 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
is either shining directly into the signal 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
or is shining directly behind it. Signals 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
are usually equipped with hoods to 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
reduce the problem, and lenses are 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
designed so far as possible to minimise 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
the reflection of sunlight, which could 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
otherwise produce so called ‘phantom 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
aspects’ where the lamp appears to be 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
alight but is not.

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
Signals must be highly reliable, for 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
both safety and train performance 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
reasons. On many railways, failure of 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
a signal light is considered sufficiently 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
hazardous that the signalling system 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
has built-in mitigations to minimise 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
the risk of a driver encountering 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
an un-illuminated (‘black’ or ‘dark’) 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
signal. Typical arrangements include 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
double filament lamps, one being the 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
standby for the other; proving within 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
the signalling system that the signal 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
ahead is alight before a driver is given 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
a movement authority towards it; and 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
restricting aspects and their sequences 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
so that drivers only encounter correctly 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
illuminated signals. Railways’ operating 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
rules usually state that in the unlikely 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
event of a driver encountering an 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
un-illuminated signal, they should treat 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
it as displaying ‘stop’.

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
The use of LEDs in signals has made the 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
sudden failure of a light very infrequent 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
compared with filament lamps. Each 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
light typically comprises a matrix of 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
multiple LEDs and therefore a single LED 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
failure only marginally degrades visibility.

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
Maintenance considerations

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
Signals need to be maintained, which 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
may include cleaning the lenses, 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
replacing failed lamps, and periodically 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
checking beam alignment and 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
lamp voltages. 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
Safe access for maintenance staff is 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
therefore an important consideration 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
in the design of signal structures and, 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
to some extent, in their positioning as 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
well (although the needs of the driver 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
take precedence). Signals are usually 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
equipped with ladders for access, 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
although some modern lightweight 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
single post structures have a fold-down 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
arrangement so that the signal can be 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
lowered to the ground for maintenance. 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
Cantilever and gantry structures are 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
sometimes used in preference to

single posts to facilitate access for 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
maintenance purposes without requiring 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
staff to cross the tracks, a walkway for 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
maintainers being an integral part of 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
the structure. 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
Some signals use optical fibres to 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
transmit the light to the signal head, 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
allowing the lamp unit to be placed 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
closer to ground level to make 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
maintenance easier and allowing the 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
signal head to be mounted on a simpler 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
structure, or even on the overhead 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
electrification supports if space and 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
visibility requirements permit.

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
Signals for low‑speed 

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
movements

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
So far, we have only discussed the main 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
signals used for running movements, 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
where a train is travelling at speed 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
from A to B. Railways must also make 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
provision for a variety of other train 

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
movements, for which distinctly different 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
signals are generally used. These 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
movements include:

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
• Shunting into and out of sidings. 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
Such movements may be in 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
the opposite direction to the 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
normal traffic flow.

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
• Detaching/attaching locomotives 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
and wagons from/to trains.

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
• Enabling a train to enter a section 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
of line already occupied by another 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
train, for instance where a platform is 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
to be shared by two trains or where 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
two trains are to be joined together.

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
• Moving a train over a crossover from 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
one line to another so that it can 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
reverse direction and travel back on 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
the other line.

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
The signals used for these purposes are 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
generally known as shunting or position 

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
light signals, although when associated 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
with a main signal (i.e., attached to the 

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
same structure) they are sometimes 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
called subsidiary signals. The colour 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
red is commonly used to denote stop, 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
and authority to proceed is indicated 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
by white or yellow lights (often in pairs), 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
see Figure 11. This is not universal 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
practice however, and railways use many 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
different forms. The USA, for instance, 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
has several types of position light signals 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
(and, incidentally, main signal aspects 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
as well), their existence being due to 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
the varied historical development of the 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
railroad companies.

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
Because shunting signals are used only 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
for low-speed movements, they are 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
not designed to be visible over great 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
distances, nor is there any need for 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
aspect sequences to warn drivers to slow 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
down when approaching a shunt signal 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
displaying stop. The signals are generally 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
located close to ground level, except 

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
where they are associated with a main 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
signal, when they are mounted alongside 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
or immediately below the main head.

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
Tramways (streetcar systems) also 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
generally operate at low speeds and 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
braking distances are sufficiently short 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
that a tram (streetcar) can be brought 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
to a stand when the driver sees a signal 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
displaying stop, without the need for 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
‘distant’ signals. Signals are provided 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
to indicate when and where to stop 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
at intersections with roads and other 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
tram lines (including entry to single line 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
sections), and they may also indicate 

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
which route is set. 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
Tramway signals take many different 

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
forms, and streets both intersect tram 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
tracks and share the same space. It is 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
therefore important to ensure that signs, 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
road markings and signals for trams 

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
are distinct and different from those 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
applicable to motorists and pedestrians. 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
Both motorists and tram drivers need to 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
be aware of signals applicable to them, 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
and to some extent also understand the 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
meaning of those which apply to the 

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
other mode of transport, see Figure 12.

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
How train warning and 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
protection systems help 

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
drivers to obey lineside signals

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
A separate “Back to Basics” article deals 

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
with the subject of train protection 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
systems, and it is not the intention to 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
go into the details of such systems 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
here. However, it is worth mentioning 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
the role of both warning systems and 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
protection systems in the context of 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
lineside signalling.

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
Train-borne warning systems alert 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
the driver to take note of information 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
presented by lineside signals, and they 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
may initiate braking if the driver fails 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
to acknowledge the warning. After 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
acknowledgement, the train is usually 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
solely under driver control. 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
Train-borne protection systems monitor 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
the speed of the train and cause a brake 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
application if the train is being driven 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
outside safe limits. Some, such as train-

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
stops, intervene to apply the brakes if 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
a train passes a signal at danger (stop) 

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
but without providing a visual or audible 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
warning before doing so. At the opposite 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
end of the spectrum, continuous

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
Automatic Train Protection systems (ATP) 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
provide comprehensive information 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
about the speed profile that the driver 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
should be following, warn the driver of 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
over-speeding, and intervene to slow 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
the train down if the train speed is not 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
reduced appropriately.

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
Warning and protection systems that 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
are provided in conjunction with 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
lineside signals can assist the driver 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
in several ways:

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
1. They can help maintain the driver’s 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
vigilance by providing in-cab visual/

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
audible indications or warnings 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
on the approach to each signal, 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
repeating some of the information 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
provided by the signal.

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
2. They can pr ovide an in-cab reminder 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
of the aspect or information 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
displayed by a signal after the 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
driver has passed it.

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
3. They can aid the driver in observing 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
signals in conditions of poor 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
visibility, such as fog.

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
4. They can intervene to slow the train 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
down if the system judges that the 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
train speed is too high.

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
Cab signalling

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
Before we go further, note that trains 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
which are driven using Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
Operation (ATO) are not part of this 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
discussion, nor are we considering Driver 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
Advisory Systems (DAS), which assist the 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
driver in driving optimally (better time-

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
keeping and energy-efficient driving) but 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
are not a substitute for lineside signals. 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
See ITC Report 44 for more information 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
about DAS. irse.info/itc44

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
Cab signalling may be provided for 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
various reasons, including better 

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
operational performance, improved 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
safety and reduced costs. Bob Barnard’s 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
article “What can cab signalling ever 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
do for us?” in issue 239 of IRSE News 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
(December 2017) irse.info/irsenews239 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
provides an excellent broader 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
perspective on the challenges and 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
benefits of cab signalling.

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
Modern cab signalling systems 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
provide comprehensive in-cab driving 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
information for the driver to operate 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
the train safely and optimally without 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
the need for lineside signals (even if 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
they are still provided for unfitted rolling 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
stock). On lines without signals, lineside 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
signs (marker boards) may be provided 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
to tell the driver precisely where to 

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
stop the front of the train at the end of 

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
a movement authority, but apart from 

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
that almost all the information the driver 

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
requires is available via the cab display 

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
(see Figure 13). 

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
The display is often called a driver-

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
machine interface (DMI), but we will 

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
continue to use the term 'cab display' 

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
in this article.

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
Most cab signalling systems include 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
ATP which, as we have already noted, 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
monitors the driver’s actions and 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
intervenes if the train exceeds the 

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
maximum safe speed. Under normal 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
circumstances the driver is in full control 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
of the train. Even if the system warns 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
them that the train is travelling too fast, 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
the driver remains in control unless they 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
fail to heed the warning and slow down. 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
Like lineside signals, the cab display must 

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
be readable, interpretable and driveable.

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
Readability of the cab 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
display means that:

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
1. It must be easily visible by the driver 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
from their normal position in the 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
cab, even under difficult lighting 

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
conditions such as bright sunlight.

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
2. W arnings and other important ‘alert’ 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
information must be particularly 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
prominent and supported by clear 

--- Document Chunk 1010 ---
and distinguishable audible warnings.

--- Document Chunk 1011 ---
Interpretability of the cab 

--- Document Chunk 1012 ---
display means that:

--- Document Chunk 1013 ---
1. The in formation displayed must be 

--- Document Chunk 1014 ---
clear, unambiguous and consistent 

--- Document Chunk 1015 ---
with any other information that 

--- Document Chunk 1016 ---
may be available to the driver 

--- Document Chunk 1017 ---
(whether in the cab or by lineside 

--- Document Chunk 1018 ---
signals and signs).

--- Document Chunk 1019 ---
2. The in formation must make sense 

--- Document Chunk 1020 ---
to the driver without the need for 

--- Document Chunk 1021 ---
mental computations or geo-spatial 

--- Document Chunk 1022 ---
interpretation.

--- Document Chunk 1023 ---
Driveability requires that:

--- Document Chunk 1024 ---
1. In formation must be provided to 

--- Document Chunk 1025 ---
enable the train to be driven safely, 

--- Document Chunk 1026 ---
including, for example, current and 

--- Document Chunk 1027 ---
upcoming speed limits/profiles, 

--- Document Chunk 1028 ---
the distance to the next stopping 

--- Document Chunk 1029 ---
position, gradients and other relevant 

--- Document Chunk 1030 ---
driving information. 

--- Document Chunk 1031 ---
2. In formation must be provided on a 

--- Document Chunk 1032 ---
timely basis, so that the driver does 

--- Document Chunk 1033 ---
not need to take abnormal action 

--- Document Chunk 1034 ---
(such as emergency braking) to 

--- Document Chunk 1035 ---
comply with it.

--- Document Chunk 1036 ---
3. In formation that requires the driver 

--- Document Chunk 1037 ---
to take action (either immediately or 

--- Document Chunk 1038 ---
later) must remain displayed for as 

--- Document Chunk 1039 ---
long as it is relevant. 

--- Document Chunk 1040 ---
4. The system must be designed so tha t 

--- Document Chunk 1041 ---
the driver can control the train speed 

--- Document Chunk 1042 ---
without the system intervening – 

--- Document Chunk 1043 ---
provided of course that they comply 

--- Document Chunk 1044 ---
with speed limits and do not pass 

--- Document Chunk 1045 ---
the end of any movement authority. 

--- Document Chunk 1046 ---
Where a system intervention may 

--- Document Chunk 1047 ---
become necessary (for instance, due 

--- Document Chunk 1048 ---
to over-speeding), it should normally 

--- Document Chunk 1049 ---
be preceded by a warning so that 

--- Document Chunk 1050 ---
the driver can take the appropriate 

--- Document Chunk 1051 ---
corrective action.

--- Document Chunk 1052 ---
Most cab signalling systems are designed 

--- Document Chunk 1053 ---
on the ‘head up’ principle. In other 

--- Document Chunk 1054 ---
words, the driver looks out of the cab 

--- Document Chunk 1055 ---
window at the track ahead most of the 

--- Document Chunk 1056 ---
Figure 13 – Typical cab display for ETCS (left) and a CBTC system (right).

--- Document Chunk 1059 ---
time, glancing at the display only when 

--- Document Chunk 1060 ---
necessary. This is particularly important 

--- Document Chunk 1061 ---
on railways where it is possible that 

--- Document Chunk 1062 ---
an obstruction could arise on the line 

--- Document Chunk 1063 ---
ahead – although of course there is 

--- Document Chunk 1064 ---
no guarantee that the driver could 

--- Document Chunk 1065 ---
take action to prevent a collision. 

--- Document Chunk 1066 ---
The ‘head up’ principle makes it doubly 

--- Document Chunk 1067 ---
important that the in-cab system, and 

--- Document Chunk 1068 ---
the display in particular, is designed to 

--- Document Chunk 1069 ---
facilitate this driving style, for instance 

--- Document Chunk 1070 ---
by providing audible alerts when new 

--- Document Chunk 1071 ---
information is displayed that requires a 

--- Document Chunk 1072 ---
response by the driver.

--- Document Chunk 1073 ---
Cab displays are usually interactive, 

--- Document Chunk 1074 ---
requiring the driver to input information 

--- Document Chunk 1075 ---
(for example, at the start of a journey, 

--- Document Chunk 1076 ---
or when changing the driving mode, 

--- Document Chunk 1077 ---
or to acknowledge warnings). Other 

--- Document Chunk 1078 ---
information, such as the speedometer, 

--- Document Chunk 1079 ---
may also be integrated into the display. 

--- Document Chunk 1080 ---
Ergonomic factors are therefore 

--- Document Chunk 1081 ---
important in the design of the display 

--- Document Chunk 1082 ---
and associated input keys.

--- Document Chunk 1083 ---
Closing remarks

--- Document Chunk 1084 ---
In this article we have attempted to 

--- Document Chunk 1085 ---
present a broad picture of lineside colour 

--- Document Chunk 1086 ---
light signals, their purposes, and their 

--- Document Chunk 1087 ---
variations. We have explained the most 

--- Document Chunk 1088 ---
commonly used aspects, the differences 

--- Document Chunk 1089 ---
between speed and route signalling, 

--- Document Chunk 1090 ---
and the importance of meeting the 

--- Document Chunk 1091 ---
driver’s need for signals to be readable, 

--- Document Chunk 1092 ---
interpretable and driveable. 

--- Document Chunk 1093 ---
We have considered how train 

--- Document Chunk 1094 ---
protection and warning systems support 

--- Document Chunk 1095 ---
the driving task in lineside signalled 

--- Document Chunk 1096 ---
territory. Finally, we have acknowledged 

--- Document Chunk 1097 ---
that, although full cab signalling (with 

--- Document Chunk 1098 ---
ATP) removes many of the issues 

--- Document Chunk 1099 ---
associated with lineside signals, the need 

--- Document Chunk 1100 ---
to make the information displayed in the 

--- Document Chunk 1101 ---
cab readable, interpretable and driveable 

--- Document Chunk 1102 ---
remains important.

--- Document Chunk 1103 ---
If you are new to railway signalling, we 

--- Document Chunk 1104 ---
recommend that you learn more about 

--- Document Chunk 1105 ---
the lineside signals that are used on 

--- Document Chunk 1106 ---
railways with which you are familiar. 

--- Document Chunk 1107 ---
What aspects and aspect sequences 

--- Document Chunk 1108 ---
are used? How are diverging junctions 

--- Document Chunk 1109 ---
signalled? How well do the signals 

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
meet the needs of drivers, as set out 

--- Document Chunk 1111 ---
in this article?

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
You might also investigate types of 

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
signals that have not been mentioned 

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
– for instance, special signals used 

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
to authorise a train to depart from a 

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
platform when it is ready to leave; or 

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
situations where fixed lineside signs are 

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
used instead of colour light signals; or 

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
signals used in conjunction with some 

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---
types of level (grade) crossings.
