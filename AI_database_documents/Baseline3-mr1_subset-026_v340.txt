1.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
1.3.1.1 Train control is an important part of any railway operations management system. In the 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
past a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems ha ve evolved in 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
different countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
interoperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
country, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed devel opment 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
which have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions. 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
1.3.1.2 Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
rethinking their i nfrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
ATC sys tems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
standardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
standardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS). 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
1.4.1.1 The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as: 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
 Cross border interoperability. 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
 Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic. 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
 Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.  

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
 Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
exploitation of maximum track capacity. 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
 The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology. 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
 Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
components. Strengthe ning the position of the European railway industry on the 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
world market. 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
 Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic 

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
management. 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
1.5 About this Document 

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
1.5.1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
(ETCS) from a technical point of view. 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
1.5.1.2 Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
control systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a transition period. They might be removed 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
in a future edition of the standard. 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
1.5.1.3 To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
and understood according to well specified rul es but also that a train respectively

Page 6/8 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
trackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
interoperability requires specifications of a detailed level.  

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
1.5.1.4 For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, eng ineering 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
standards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
the scope of the SRS.  

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS  

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
1.6.1.1 The SRS covers 8 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
introduction. 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
1.6.1.2 All readers may need to refer to the Glossary  of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET -

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
023). 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
1.7 Mandatory and Optional Requirements  

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
1.7.1.1 This specification often offers multiple solutions on how to implement a specific 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
function. It therefore contains both mandatory and optional requirements. Mandatory 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
requirements are always referred to using the word “shall” where else optional 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
requirements are referred to using the word “may”.  

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
1.7.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all mandatory requirements, 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
with the only exception s and conditions explicitly stated in the Control -Command and 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
Signalling TSI and in this SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
1.7.1.3 For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
according to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational need s. 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
In any case, the requirements of this SRS related to the implemented functions shall 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
be respected. 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
1.7.1.4 Notes are added to the specification in some parts for clarification. They however 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
never contain requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
1.7.1.5 Not specified requirements and solutions ar e only permitted as long as they do not 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
generate any interoperability problems.   

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
1.8 Contents of the SRS 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
1.8.1.1 The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
(ETCS) of ERTMS..  

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
1.8.1.2 This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of  the contents of each chapter 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
within the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
the relevant chapters.

1.8.2 Chapter 1: Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
1.8.2.1 Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
the SRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter. 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
1.8.3 Chapter 2: Basic System Description 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
1.8.3.1 Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure. 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
1.8.3.2 Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels.  

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
1.8.3.3 Chapter 2 does not contain technical requirements.  

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
1.8.4 Chapter 3: Principles 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
1.8.4.1 Chapter 3 specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These principles apply to 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
onboard and trackside subsystems.  

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
1.8.4.2 The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.  

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
1.8.5 Chapter 4: Modes and Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
transitions between modes. 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
1.8.6 Chapter 5: Procedures 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
1.8.6.1 Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
interoperability. Proced ures are presented by a state transition chart and a 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
corresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
defined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
onboard unit and the conditions that m ust be fulfilled to switch from one state to 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
another. 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
1.8.7 Chapter 6: Management of older System Versions 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and list s the 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
exceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in th e other 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
chapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used  by the 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
trackside subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
1.8.8 Chapter 7: ERTMS/ETCS Language 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
1.8.8.1 Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
over the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
described. The format of messages is given in Chapter 8.

2.4 System structure 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
2.4.1.1 Due to the nature of the required functions, the ERTMS/ETCS system will have to be 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
partly on the trackside and partly on board the trains.  

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
2.4.1.2 This defines two sub-systems, the on-board sub-system and the trackside sub-system. 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
2.4.1.3 The environment of ERTMS/ETCS system is composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
a) the train, which will then be considered in the train interface specification; 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
b) the driver, which will then be considered via the driver interface specification; 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
c) other onboard interfaces (see architecture drawing in 2.5.3), 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
d) external trackside systems (interlockings, control centres, etc.), for which no 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
interoperability requirement will be established.

2.5 Sub-systems 

--- Document Chunk 541 ---
2.5.1 Trackside subsystem 

--- Document Chunk 542 ---
2.5.1.1 Depending of the application level (see further sections), the trackside sub -system can 

--- Document Chunk 543 ---
be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 544 ---
a) balise 

--- Document Chunk 545 ---
b) lineside electronic unit 

--- Document Chunk 546 ---
c) the radio communication network (GSM-R) 

--- Document Chunk 547 ---
d) the Radio Block Centre (RBC) 

--- Document Chunk 548 ---
e) Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 549 ---
f) Radio infill unit 

--- Document Chunk 550 ---
g) Key Management Centre (KMC) 

--- Document Chunk 551 ---
2.5.1.2 Balise 

--- Document Chunk 552 ---
2.5.1.2.1 The balise is a transmission device that can send telegrams to the on -board sub -

--- Document Chunk 553 ---
system. 

--- Document Chunk 554 ---
2.5.1.2.2 The balise is based on the existing Eurobalise specifications. These document s are 

--- Document Chunk 555 ---
included in the frame of the ERTMS/ETCS specifications. 

--- Document Chunk 556 ---
2.5.1.2.3 The balises provides the up -link, i. e. the possibility to send messages from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 557 ---
to the on-board sub-system. 

--- Document Chunk 558 ---
2.5.1.2.4 The balises can provide fixed messages or, when connected to a lineside electr onic 

--- Document Chunk 559 ---
unit, messages that can be changed.  

--- Document Chunk 560 ---
2.5.1.2.5 The balises will be organised in groups, each balise transmitting a telegram and the 

--- Document Chunk 561 ---
combination of all telegrams defining the message sent by the balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 562 ---
2.5.1.3 Lineside electronic unit 

--- Document Chunk 563 ---
2.5.1.3.1 The lineside electronic units are electronic devices, that generate telegrams to be sent 

--- Document Chunk 564 ---
by balises, on basis of information received from external trackside systems. 

--- Document Chunk 565 ---
2.5.1.4 Trackside radio communication network (GSM-R) 

--- Document Chunk 566 ---
2.5.1.4.1 The GSM -R radio communication network is used for the bi -directional exchange of

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
2.5.1.5.1 The RBC is a computer-based system that elaborates messages to be sent to the train 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
on basis of information received from external trackside systems a nd on basis of 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
information exchanged with the on-board sub-systems.  

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
2.5.1.5.2 The main objective of these messages is to provide movement authorities to allow the 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
safe movement of trains on the Railway infrastructure area under the responsibility of 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
2.5.1.5.3 The interoperability requirements for the RBC are mainly related to the data exchange 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
between the RBC and the on-board sub-system. 

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
2.5.1.6 Euroloop 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
2.5.1.6.1 The Euroloop subsystem operates on Level 1 lines, providing signalling information in

2.6 Levels and transitions 

--- Document Chunk 724 ---
2.6.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 725 ---
2.6.1.1 The different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to expre ss the 

--- Document Chunk 726 ---
possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related 

--- Document Chunk 727 ---
to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the on -

--- Document Chunk 728 ---
board units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 729 ---
equipment respectively.  

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
2.6.1.2 Different levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the requir ed performance. 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
2.6.1.3 For the purpose of a consistent specification a level 0 has been defined. This level is 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
used for operation on non -equipped (unfitted) lines or on lines  equipped with train 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
control system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.  

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
2.6.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
2.6.2.1 A train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment always co -operates with the 

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside equipment in a defined ERTMS/ETCS level.  

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
2.6.2.2 All transitions between levels are performed according to well-specified rules.  

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
2.6.2.3 ERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:  

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Level 0 (train equipp ed with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
equipped with any train control system  (ERTMS/ETCS or national system ) or on a 

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
their supervision is currently not possible) 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Le vel NTC (train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
equipped with a national system) 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission (train equipped 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
2.6.2.4 It is possible to superimpose several application levels in parallel on the same track, for 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
example to run trains without train integrity device in level 2 and in parallel trains 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
equipped with train integrity device in level 3. Other examples might be a station which 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
is shared by trains arriving over level 1 and level 2 lines (junctions) or parallel operation 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
of a national system with ERTMS/ETCS. Mixed levels are supported. 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
2.6.2.5 Levels 1, 2 and 3 are downwards compatible. This means that: 

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
 a level 3 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0, level 1 and level 2 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
 a level 2 equipped train is also able to operate in level 0 and level 1 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
2.6.3.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
2.6.3.1.1 Level 0 covers operation of ETCS equipped trains on lines not equipped with ETCS or 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
national systems or on li nes where trackside ERTMS/ETCS infrastructure and/or 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
national systems may exist but operation under their supervision is currently not 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
possible (e.g. commissioning or on-board/trackside failed components).  

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
2.6.3.1.2 In Level 0 it is authorized to operate trains wit hout any train control system and 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
therefore line side optical signals or other means of signalling are used to give 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
movement authorities to the driver.  

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
2.6.3.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment provides no supervision except of the maximum 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
design speed of a train and maximum speed permitted in unfitted areas.  

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
2.6.3.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
certain special commands are interpreted. 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
2.6.3.1.6 No supervisory information is indicated on the DMI except the train speed. Train data

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
2.6.4.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
2.6.4.1.1 Level NTC is used to run ERTMS/ETCS equipped trains on lines equipped with 

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
national train control and speed supervision systems.  

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
2.6.4.1.2 Train control information ge nerated trackside by the national train control system is 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
transmitted to the train via the communication channels of the underlying national 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
system.  

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
2.6.4.1.3 Note: Lineside optical signals might be necessary or not, depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
performance and functionality of the underlying systems.  

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
2.6.4.1.4 Intentionally deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
2.6.4.1.5 The achievable level of supervision is similar to the one provided by the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
national systems.  

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
2.6.4.1.6 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by equipment external to 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
ERTMS/ETCS.  

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
2.6.4.1.7 Level NTC uses no ERTMS/ETCS track -train information except to 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
announce/command level transitions and specific commands related to balise 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
transmission. Eurobalises therefore still have to be read. 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
2.6.4.1.8 The information displayed to the driver depends on the funct ionality of the underlying 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
national system. The active national system is indicated to the driver as part of that 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
information. Full train data has to be entered in order not to have to stop a train at a 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
level transition position and to supervise maximum train speed. 

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
2.6.4.1.9 A combination of national systems can be regarded as one NTC level. 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
2.6.4.1.10 Depending on the functionality and the configuration of the specific national system 

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
installed onboard, the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard system may need to be interfaced to it, 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
in order t o perform the transitions from/to the national system and/or in order to give 

--- Document Chunk 877 ---
access to ERTMS/ETCS Onboard resources (e.g. DMI). This can be achieved through 

--- Document Chunk 878 ---
a device called an STM (Specific Transmission Module) using a standardised interface.

2.6.5 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
2.6.5.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
2.6.5.1.1 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission based train control system to be used as 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
an overlay on an underlying signalling system. 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
2.6.5.1.2 Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train via  

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
Eurobalises.  

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
2.6.5.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
protects against overrun of the authority.  

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
2.6.5.1.4 Train detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits etc.) and are 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
2.6.5.1.5 Level 1 is based on Eurobalises as spot transmission devices.   

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
2.6.5.1.6 The trackside equipment does not know the train to which it sends information. 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
2.6.5.1.7 If in level 1 a lineside signal clears, an approaching train can not receive this 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
information until it passes the Eurobalise group at that signal. The driver therefore has 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
to observe the lineside signal to know when to proceed. The train has then to be 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
permitted to approach the stopping location below a maximum permitted release 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
speed.  

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
2.6.5.1.8 Additional Eurobalises can be placed between distant and main signals to transmit infill 

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
information, the train will receive new information before reaching the signal.  

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
2.6.5.1.9 Note: Lineside signals are required in level 1 applications, except if semi -continuous 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
infill is provided. 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
2.6.5.1.10 Semi-continuous infill can be provided using Euroloop or radio infil l. In this case, the 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
on-board system will be able to show new information to the driver as soon as it is 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
available and even at standstill.  

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
2.6.5.1.11 Euroloop or radio infill can improve the safety of a level 1 system as they allow the 

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
operation without release speed.

2.6.7 ERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 

--- Document Chunk 1106 ---
2.6.7.1 General description 

--- Document Chunk 1107 ---
2.6.7.1.1 ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 is a radio based train control system. 

--- Document Chunk 1108 ---
2.6.7.1.2 Movement authorities are generated trackside and are transmitted to the train v ia 

--- Document Chunk 1109 ---
Euroradio.  

--- Document Chunk 1110 ---
2.6.7.1.3 ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also 

--- Document Chunk 1111 ---
protects against overrun of the authority.  

--- Document Chunk 1112 ---
2.6.7.1.4 Train position and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside radio block 

--- Document Chunk 1113 ---
centre in co -operation with t he train (which sends position reports and train integrity 

--- Document Chunk 1114 ---
information).  

--- Document Chunk 1115 ---
2.6.7.1.5 Level 3 is based on Euroradio for track to train communication and on Eurobalises as 

--- Document Chunk 1116 ---
spot transmission devices mainly for location referencing.   

--- Document Chunk 1117 ---
2.6.7.1.6 The trackside radio block centre whi ch provides the information to the trains knows 

--- Document Chunk 1118 ---
each train individually by the ERTMS/ETCS identity of its leading ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 1119 ---
board equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 1120 ---

2.6.7.2.1 Trackside equipment:  

--- Document Chunk 1142 ---
 Radio block centre. 

--- Document Chunk 1143 ---
 Euroradio for bi-directional track-train communication. 

--- Document Chunk 1144 ---
 Eurobalises for mainly location referencing.  

--- Document Chunk 1145 ---
2.6.7.2.2 Main ERTMS/ETCS trackside function: 

--- Document Chunk 1146 ---
 Knowing each train within an RBC area by its ERTMS/ETCS identity.  

--- Document Chunk 1147 ---
 Following each trains location within an RBC area.  

--- Document Chunk 1148 ---
 Route locking and route releasing based on information received from the trains. 

--- Document Chunk 1149 ---
 Determine movement authorities for each train individually.  

--- Document Chunk 1150 ---
 Transmit movement authorities and track description  to each train individually.  

--- Document Chunk 1151 ---
 Handing over of train control between different RBC’s at the RBC-RBC borders. 

--- Document Chunk 1152 ---
2.6.7.2.3 On-board equipment:  

--- Document Chunk 1153 ---
 Onboard equipment with Eurobalise and Euroradio transmissions. 

--- Document Chunk 1154 ---
 Train integrity proving system. 

--- Document Chunk 1155 ---
2.6.7.2.4 Main ERTMS/ETCS on-board functions: 

--- Document Chunk 1156 ---
 The train reads Eurobalises and sends its position relative to the detected balises to 

--- Document Chunk 1157 ---
the radio block centre. 

--- Document Chunk 1158 ---
 The train monitors train integrity (external function, not  part of ERTMS/ETCS) and 

--- Document Chunk 1159 ---
sends this information to the radio block centre. 

--- Document Chunk 1160 ---
 The train receives a movement authority and the track description  via Euroradio 

--- Document Chunk 1161 ---
relating to a balise.  

--- Document Chunk 1162 ---
 Selection of the most restrictive value of the different speeds permitted at each 

--- Document Chunk 1163 ---
location ahead. 

--- Document Chunk 1164 ---
 Calculation of a dynamic speed profile, taking into account the train running/braking 

--- Document Chunk 1165 ---
characteristics which are known on-board and the track description data. 

--- Document Chunk 1166 ---
 Comparison of the train speed with the permitted speed and commanding of the  

--- Document Chunk 1167 ---
brake application if necessary.  

--- Document Chunk 1168 ---
 Cab signalling to the driver.

2.6.8 Level transitions 

--- Document Chunk 1181 ---
2.6.8.1 An ERTMS/ETCS equipment which is not isolated always operates in one of the above 

--- Document Chunk 1182 ---
described levels. All transitions between these levels are performed according to 

--- Document Chunk 1183 ---
defined functions and procedures.  

--- Document Chunk 1184 ---
2.6.8.2 Additional national functions and rules which might be used by an individual railway to 

--- Document Chunk 1185 ---
for example prevent not equipped trains from entering a level 2/3 area are not 

--- Document Chunk 1186 ---
specified here and have to be implemented outside ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 1187 ---
2.6.8.3 The following table shows all possible transitions (marked with Grey):

3.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 1621 ---
3.3.1 Scope and purpose 

--- Document Chunk 1622 ---
3.3.1.1 The chapter 3, Principles, specifies the system principles of ETCS/ERTMS. These 

--- Document Chunk 1623 ---
principles apply to on-board and trackside subsystems. 

--- Document Chunk 1624 ---
3.3.1.2 The principles define the operational and technical behavio ur of the system in general 

--- Document Chunk 1625 ---
and functional terms. 

--- Document Chunk 1626 ---
3.3.1.3 The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several 

--- Document Chunk 1627 ---
requirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification 

--- Document Chunk 1628 ---
number. 

--- Document Chunk 1629 ---
3.3.1.4 Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as 

--- Document Chunk 1630 ---
requirements. 

--- Document Chunk 1631 ---
3.4 Balise configuration and linking 

--- Document Chunk 1632 ---
3.4.1 Balise Configurations – Balise Group Definition 

--- Document Chunk 1633 ---
3.4.1.1 A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises. 

--- Document Chunk 1634 ---
3.4.1.2 In every balise shall at least be stored: 

--- Document Chunk 1635 ---
a) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise 

--- Document Chunk 1636 ---
b) The number of balises inside the group 

--- Document Chunk 1637 ---
c) The balise group identity. 

--- Document Chunk 1638 ---
3.4.1.3 The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the 

--- Document Chunk 1639 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1640 ---
3.4.2 Balise Co-ordinate System 

--- Document Chunk 1641 ---
3.4.2.1.1 Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system. 

--- Document Chunk 1642 ---
3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co -ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse 

--- Document Chunk 1643 ---
direction) is identified as balise group orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 1644 ---
3.4.2.2 Balise groups composed of two or more balises 

--- Document Chunk 1645 ---
3.4.2.2.1 The origin of the co -ordinate system for each b alise group shall be given by the balise 

--- Document Chunk 1646 ---
number 1 (called location reference) in the balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1647 ---
3.4.2.2.2 The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise 

--- Document Chunk 1648 ---
numbers.

balise group detected, being a single balise group, i.e. no linking information is 

--- Document Chunk 1721 ---
available to identify the orientation of the co-ordinate system of this single balise group, 

--- Document Chunk 1722 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall report its position by means of a position 

--- Document Chunk 1723 ---
report based on two balise groups reporting the train position in reference to the LRBG 

--- Document Chunk 1724 ---
and the “previous LRBG”, if any. 

--- Document Chunk 1725 ---
3.4.2.3.3.1.1 Note: Receiving this type of position report advises the RBC of the need to assign a 

--- Document Chunk 1726 ---
co-ordinate system to this single balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1727 ---
3.4.2.3.3.2 When a single balise group is d etected and the previous LRBG is known, the position 

--- Document Chunk 1728 ---
report based on two balise groups shall use as direction reference a move from the  

--- Document Chunk 1729 ---
“previous LRBG”  towards this single balise group (being the new LRBG): directional 

--- Document Chunk 1730 ---
information in the position report po inting in the same direction as the direction 

--- Document Chunk 1731 ---
reference shall be reported as “nominal”, otherwise as “reverse”.

3.4.2.3.3.3 If the “previous LRBG “ is not known, the “previous LRBG” and all directional 

--- Document Chunk 1733 ---

3.4.3 Balise Information Types and Usage 

--- Document Chunk 1847 ---
3.4.3.1 In level 1, a ll information to the on -board system is given from balise groups or 

--- Document Chunk 1848 ---
additionally from EUROLOOPS or Radio Infill Units  (see section 3.9). In level 2/3, 

--- Document Chunk 1849 ---
balise groups are mostly used for location information. 

--- Document Chunk 1850 ---
3.4.3.2 A balise may contain directional information, i.e. valid either  for nominal or for reverse 

--- Document Chunk 1851 ---
direction, or m ay contain information valid for both directions . In level 1, t his 

--- Document Chunk 1852 ---
information can be of the following type (please refer to section 3.8.5): 

--- Document Chunk 1853 ---
a) Non-infill 

--- Document Chunk 1854 ---
b) Intentionally deleted 

--- Document Chunk 1855 ---
c) Infill. 

--- Document Chunk 1856 ---
3.4.3.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 1857 ---
3.4.3.2.2 Note: Infill informati on is referring to the location reference of an announced balise 

--- Document Chunk 1858 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1859 ---
3.4.3.3 Some information shall be read also in sleeping mode and when no linking information 

--- Document Chunk 1860 ---
is available (see Chapter 4 Use of received information). If such information is 

--- Document Chunk 1861 ---
transmitted by balises, and if the information is directional, balise groups consisting of 

--- Document Chunk 1862 ---
at least two balises shall be used. 

--- Document Chunk 1863 ---
3.4.4 Linking 

--- Document Chunk 1864 ---
3.4.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 1865 ---
3.4.4.1.1 Aim of linking:  

--- Document Chunk 1866 ---
 To determine whether a balise group has been missed or not found within the 

--- Document Chunk 1867 ---
expectation window (see section 3.4.4.4) and take the appropriate action.  

--- Document Chunk 1868 ---
 To assign a co-ordinate system to balise groups consisting of a single balise. 

--- Document Chunk 1869 ---
 To correct the confidence interval due to odometer inaccuracy (see section 3.6.4). 

--- Document Chunk 1870 ---
3.4.4.1.2 A balise group is linked when its linking information (see section 3.4.4.2) is known in 

--- Document Chunk 1871 ---
advance. 

--- Document Chunk 1872 ---
3.4.4.1.2.1 Note: In cases where a balise group contains repositioning information, the term linked 

--- Document Chunk 1873 ---
also applies since the balise group is announced, marked as linked and contains 

--- Document Chunk 1874 ---
repositioning information marked accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 1875 ---
3.4.4.2 Content of linking information 

--- Document Chunk 1876 ---
3.4.4.2.1 Linking information shall be composed of: 

--- Document Chunk 1877 ---
a) The identity of the linked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1878 ---
b) Where the location reference of the group has to be found.

--- Document Chunk 1889 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 1890 ---
c) The accuracy of this location. 

--- Document Chunk 1891 ---
Note: If the reference balise is duplicated, it is the trackside responsibility to define 

--- Document Chunk 1892 ---
the location accuracy to cover at least the location of the two duplicated balises. 

--- Document Chunk 1893 ---
d) The direction with which the linked balise group will be passed over (nominal or 

--- Document Chunk 1894 ---
reverse). 

--- Document Chunk 1895 ---
e) The reaction required if a data consistency problem occurs with the expected balise 

--- Document Chunk 1896 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1897 ---
3.4.4.2.1.1 "Linking information is used" shall be interpreted as when balise group(s) are 

--- Document Chunk 1898 ---
announced and the minimum safe antenna position has not yet passed the expectation 

--- Document Chunk 1899 ---
window of the furthest announced balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1900 ---
3.4.4.2.2 Instead of the identity of a linked balise group it shall be possible to identify a following 

--- Document Chunk 1901 ---
linked balise group as unknown but containing repositioning information 

--- Document Chunk 1902 ---
3.4.4.2.2.1 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 1903 ---
3.4.4.2.2.2 Note 1: Regarding the repositioning information, see chapter 3.8.5.3.5 and 3.8.5.2. 

--- Document Chunk 1904 ---
3.4.4.2.2.3 Note 2: In case the identity of the next balise group is not unambiguously known 

--- Document Chunk 1905 ---
because the route is not known by the trackside, this feature allows to link this balise 

--- Document Chunk 1906 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 1907 ---
3.4.4.2.3 For each linked balise group, the trackside shall select one of the following reactions to 

--- Document Chunk 1908 ---
be used in case of data inconsistencies: 

--- Document Chunk 1909 ---
a) Train trip  (Trip mode, see Chapter 4) 

--- Document Chunk 1910 ---
b) Command service brake  

--- Document Chunk 1911 ---
c) No reaction 

--- Document Chunk 1912 ---
For further details see section 3.16.2. 

--- Document Chunk 1913 ---
3.4.4.3 Unlinked Balise Groups 

--- Document Chunk 1914 ---
3.4.4.3.1 A balise group, which contains information that must be considered even when the 

--- Document Chunk 1915 ---
balise group is not announced by linking, is called an unlinked balise group.  

--- Document Chunk 1916 ---
3.4.4.3.2 Unlinked balise groups shall consist at minimum of two balises.   

--- Document Chunk 1917 ---
3.4.4.3.3 Unlinked balise groups shall always contain the unlinked balise group qualifier. 

--- Document Chunk 1918 ---
3.4.4.4 Rules related to linking 

--- Document Chunk 1919 ---
3.4.4.4.1 When no linking information is used on -board, all balise groups shall be taken i nto 

--- Document Chunk 1920 ---
account. 

--- Document Chunk 1921 ---
3.4.4.4.2 When linking information is used on -board, only balise groups marked as linked and 

--- Document Chunk 1922 ---
included in the linking information and balise groups marked as unlinked shall be taken 

--- Document Chunk 1923 ---
into account.

--- Document Chunk 1936 ---
the linking information with a balise group with ID “unknown”, a balise group marked as 

--- Document Chunk 1937 ---
linked shall only be taken into account if: 

--- Document Chunk 1938 ---
a) the on-board equipment can determine the orientation of the linked balise group by 

--- Document Chunk 1939 ---
information from the balise group itself (therefore excluding for example single 

--- Document Chunk 1940 ---
balise groups), AND 

--- Document Chunk 1941 ---
b) the balise group contains repositioning information valid for the train orientation, 

--- Document Chunk 1942 ---
AND 

--- Document Chunk 1943 ---
c) the balise group is crossed with the direction announced in the linking information. 

--- Document Chunk 1944 ---
3.4.4.4.3 The on-board equipment shall accept a balise group marked as linked and included in 

--- Document Chunk 1945 ---
the linking information (i.e. the balise giving the location reference) from  

--- Document Chunk 1946 ---
 when the max safe front end of the train has passed the first possible location of 

--- Document Chunk 1947 ---
the balise group  

--- Document Chunk 1948 ---
until  

--- Document Chunk 1949 ---
 the min safe front end of the train has passed the last possible location of the 

--- Document Chunk 1950 ---
balise group 

--- Document Chunk 1951 ---
taking the offset between the front of the train and the balise antenna into account. 

--- Document Chunk 1952 ---
3.4.4.4.3.1 Note: The first possible location and the last possible  location of the balise group are 

--- Document Chunk 1953 ---
defined by the linking distance and the location accuracy. 

--- Document Chunk 1954 ---
3.4.4.4.3.2 Note: The interval between the outer limits to accept the balise group defines the 

--- Document Chunk 1955 ---
expectation window. 

--- Document Chunk 1956 ---
3.4.4.4.4 In case of a balise group containing repositioning information, the first possible location 

--- Document Chunk 1957 ---
shall start from the previously linked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 1958 ---
3.4.4.4.5 The on-board equipment shall expect balise groups one by one (i.e., it shall supervise 

--- Document Chunk 1959 ---
only one expectation window at a time) according to the order given by linking 

--- Document Chunk 1960 ---
information. 

--- Document Chunk 1961 ---
3.4.4.4.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop expecting a balise group and shall 

--- Document Chunk 1962 ---
expect the next one announced in the linking information (if any) when: 

--- Document Chunk 1963 ---
a) the balise group is found inside its expectation window 

--- Document Chunk 1964 ---
b) a linking consistency error is found, see 3.16.2.3.1 

--- Document Chunk 1965 ---
3.4.4.4.6.1 Linking consistency error due to early reception of balise group expected later (see 

--- Document Chunk 1966 ---
3.16.2.3.1 c)): if the balise group found is the next one announced in the linking 

--- Document Chunk 1967 ---
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall check its linking cons istency 

--- Document Chunk 1968 ---
and apply again clause 3.4.4.4.6, i.e. it will immediately expect the further next balise 

--- Document Chunk 1969 ---
group announced in the linking information.

--- Document Chunk 2206 ---
3.5.4.1 When a communication session is established , in case of a loss of the safe radio 

--- Document Chunk 2207 ---
connection, i.e., if the disconnection has not been ordered (see 3.5.5.1), the involved 

--- Document Chunk 2208 ---
entities shall consider the communication session still established for a defined t ime. 

--- Document Chunk 2209 ---
The defined time shall start as soon as EURORADIO has indicated the loss of the safe 

--- Document Chunk 2210 ---
radio connection. 

--- Document Chunk 2211 ---
3.5.4.2 When EURORADIO indicates the loss of the safe radio connection, the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 2212 ---
on-board equipment shall immediately try to set-up a new safe radio connection. 

--- Document Chunk 2213 ---
3.5.4.2.1 If the safe radio connection is not re -established after the defined time (as defined in 

--- Document Chunk 2214 ---
A3.1), both, on -board equipment and trackside, shall consider the session as 

--- Document Chunk 2215 ---
terminated. 

--- Document Chunk 2216 ---
3.5.4.3 The attempts shall be repeated, until at least one of the following conditions is met: 

--- Document Chunk 2217 ---
 The safe radio connection is set-up. 

--- Document Chunk 2218 ---
 The session is considered as terminated. 

--- Document Chunk 2219 ---
 The train passes the location indicated in the RIU order “Terminate the 

--- Document Chunk 2220 ---
communication session” 

--- Document Chunk 2221 ---
3.5.4.3.1 Note: if the session is considered as terminated due to 3.5.4.2 .1, the attempts will be 

--- Document Chunk 2222 ---
resumed immediately according to 3.5.3.4 f).

--- Document Chunk 2241 ---
3.5.5.1 The termination of a communication session shall be initiated only by the on -board and 

--- Document Chunk 2242 ---
in the following cases: 

--- Document Chunk 2243 ---
a) If an order is received from trackside (RBC , RIU  or balise groups) (see section s 

--- Document Chunk 2244 ---
3.5.3.5 and 3.5.3.6 concerning the content of the order). 

--- Document Chunk 2245 ---
b) If an error condition requiring the termination of the communication session is 

--- Document Chunk 2246 ---
detected on -board (e.g., not compatible system versions between on -board and 

--- Document Chunk 2247 ---
trackside). 

--- Document Chunk 2248 ---
c) The train is rejected by RBC during Start of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 2249 ---
d) If the driver closes the desk during Start of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 2250 ---
e) In case the train has reported having exited from an RBC area and no order to 

--- Document Chunk 2251 ---
terminate the session is received  within a fixed waiting time (see Appendix A.3.1) 

--- Document Chunk 2252 ---
from the time the position report was sen t, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 2253 ---
shall repeatedly send a position report  with the fixed waiting time after each 

--- Document Chunk 2254 ---
repetition, until the order to terminate the session is received, or  the defined number 

--- Document Chunk 2255 ---
of repetitions (see Appendix A.3.1) has been reached. If no reply is received within 

--- Document Chunk 2256 ---
the fixed waiting time  after the last repetition,  the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 2257 ---
equipment shall terminate the communication session. 

--- Document Chunk 2258 ---
f) In case of communication session with an RIU: the Level 1 is left, or, an End of 

--- Document Chunk 2259 ---

--- Document Chunk 2260 ---
3.5.5.2 In case a session is established, t he on -board equipment shall terminate the 

--- Document Chunk 2261 ---
communication session according to the following steps: 

--- Document Chunk 2262 ---
a) The on -board equipment shall send a Termination of communication session 

--- Document Chunk 2263 ---
message.  

--- Document Chunk 2264 ---
b) As soon as this information is rec eived, the trackside shall consider the 

--- Document Chunk 2265 ---
communication session terminated and send an acknowledgement to the on-board. 

--- Document Chunk 2266 ---
c) When the acknowledgement is received the on -board shall consider the 

--- Document Chunk 2267 ---
communication session terminated and request the release of the safe radio 

--- Document Chunk 2268 ---

--- Document Chunk 2334 ---
Terminal(s) to a Radio Network: 

--- Document Chunk 2335 ---
a) At power-up 

--- Document Chunk 2336 ---
b) Following driver entry of a new Radio Network identity (only if level 2 or 3) 

--- Document Chunk 2337 ---

3.5.6.2 When po wered-off, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall memorize the last 

--- Document Chunk 2339 ---
received Radio Network identity (from trackside or from driver) and shall use it when 

--- Document Chunk 2340 ---
powered-up again. 

--- Document Chunk 2341 ---
3.5.6.3 If no Radio Network identity received from trackside or from driver could have been 

--- Document Chunk 2342 ---
memorized by ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment (e.g. after a System Failure or at 

--- Document Chunk 2343 ---
very first power -up), this latter shall nevertheless order the registration of its Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 2344 ---
Terminal(s) to a default Radio Network. 

--- Document Chunk 2345 ---
3.5.6.3.1 Note 1: the source used to retrieve the default Rad io Network identity (on -board 

--- Document Chunk 2346 ---
equipment permanent storage, Mobile Terminal itself, or other external source) is 

--- Document Chunk 2347 ---
implementation dependent.  

--- Document Chunk 2348 ---
3.5.6.3.2 Note 2: if ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is powered-up in an area not covered by 

--- Document Chunk 2349 ---
the memorized or default Radio Network, attempts to register to this Radio Network will 

--- Document Chunk 2350 ---
be repeated unconditionally by the Mobile Terminal(s) until either an attempt is 

--- Document Chunk 2351 ---
successful or a new Radio Network identity is received from trackside or from driver, 

--- Document Chunk 2352 ---
preventing Mobile Terminal(s) from registering to any unwanted Radio Network. 

--- Document Chunk 2353 ---
3.5.6.4 Note: for Radio Network identity data entry by driver during SoM, please refer to 

--- Document Chunk 2354 ---
chapter 5 (Procedure Start of Mission). 

--- Document Chunk 2355 ---
3.5.6.5 On reception of the trackside order, ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 2356 ---
immediately order th e Radio Network registration of each Mobile Terminal that fulfils 

--- Document Chunk 2357 ---
the following conditions: 

--- Document Chunk 2358 ---
a) it is not yet registered to the ordered Radio Network, AND 

--- Document Chunk 2359 ---
b) it is not used for an established communication session, AND 

--- Document Chunk 2360 ---
c) no safe radio connection is being set-up 

--- Document Chunk 2361 ---
3.5.6.6 If a Mobile Terminal is not currently registered to the Radio Network ordered by 

--- Document Chunk 2362 ---
trackside and if one of the conditions b) or c) is not fulfilled, ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 2363 ---
equipment shall initiate the Radio Network registration once communication session is 

--- Document Chunk 2364 ---
terminated and safe radio connection is released. 

--- Document Chunk 2365 ---
3.5.6.7 If no Mobile Terminal is duly registered to a Radio Network, any order to contact an

3.5.7 Safe Radio Connection Indication 

--- Document Chunk 2380 ---
3.5.7.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the status of the 

--- Document Chunk 2381 ---
safe radio connection. To that purpose, the following indication statuses of the safe 

--- Document Chunk 2382 ---
radio connection are defined: “No Connection”, “Connection Lost/Set -Up failed”, 

--- Document Chunk 2383 ---
“Connection Up”. 

--- Document Chunk 2384 ---
3.5.7.2 In addition, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use a “connection status” 

--- Document Chunk 2385 ---
timer (see Appendix A.3.1), in order to manage properly the transitions to the indication 

--- Document Chunk 2386 ---
status “Connection Lost/Set-Up failed”. 

--- Document Chunk 2387 ---
3.5.7.2.1 Note: The purpose of the “connection statu s” timer is to avoid distracting the driver for 

--- Document Chunk 2388 ---
any short disturbance of the safe radio connection. 

--- Document Chunk 2389 ---
3.5.7.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall start the “connection status” timer as 

--- Document Chunk 2390 ---
soon as the first request to set-up a safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU is 

--- Document Chunk 2391 ---
sent: 

--- Document Chunk 2392 ---
a) for what regards the session establishment, see items b), c), d), e) in 3.5.3.4. 

--- Document Chunk 2393 ---
b) for what regards maintaining a communication session, see 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.4 

--- Document Chunk 2394 ---
3.5.7.4 If the “connection status” timer is ongoing, it shall be stopped if the request s to set-up 

--- Document Chunk 2395 ---
a safe radio connection are stopped with the relevant RBC/RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 2396 ---
3.5.7.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall execute the transitions between the 

--- Document Chunk 2397 ---
different indication statuses of the safe radio connection with the relevant RBC/RIU as 

--- Document Chunk 2398 ---

3.6.1.3 The Train Position information defines the position of the train front in relation  to a 

--- Document Chunk 2493 ---
balise group, which is called LRBG (the Last Relevant Balise Group). It includes: 

--- Document Chunk 2494 ---
 The estimated train front end position, defined by the estimated di stance between 

--- Document Chunk 2495 ---
the LRBG and the front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 2496 ---
 The train position confidence interval (see 3.6.4) 

--- Document Chunk 2497 ---
 Directional train position information in reference to the balise group orientation 

--- Document Chunk 2498 ---
(see 3.4.2, also Figure 14) of the LRBG, regarding: 

--- Document Chunk 2499 ---
 the position of the train front end (nominal or reverse side of the LRBG) 

--- Document Chunk 2500 ---
 the train orientation  

--- Document Chunk 2501 ---
 the train running direction 

--- Document Chunk 2502 ---
In case of an LRBG being a single balise group with no co -ordinate system 

--- Document Chunk 2503 ---
assigned, directional information is defined in reference to the pair o f LRBG and 

--- Document Chunk 2504 ---
“previous LRBG”, see 3.4.2.3.3 

--- Document Chunk 2505 ---
 A list of LRBGs, which may alternatively be used by trackside for referencing 

--- Document Chunk 2506 ---
location dependent information (see 3.6.2.2.2 c)). 

--- Document Chunk 2507 ---
3.6.1.4 Balise groups, which are marked as unlinked, shall never be used as LRBG.

3.6.1.4.1 Justification: The location of an unlinked balise group, or the balise group itself, may 

--- Document Chunk 2520 ---
not be known to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 2521 ---
3.6.1.5 If there is an active cab, this one defines the orientation of the train, i.e . the side of the 

--- Document Chunk 2522 ---
active cab shall be considered as the front of the train. If no cab is active, the train 

--- Document Chunk 2523 ---
orientation shall be as when a cab was last active. 

--- Document Chunk 2524 ---
3.6.1.6 The “train orientation relative to LRBG” is defined as the train orientation related to the 

--- Document Chunk 2525 ---
orientation of the LRBG, see Figure 14. It can be either “nominal” or “reverse”. 

--- Document Chunk 2526 ---
3.6.1.6.1 Note: The train orientation cannot be affected by the direction controller position.

3.6.2 Location of Data Transmitted to the On-Board Equipment 

--- Document Chunk 2528 ---
3.6.2.1 Data Transmitted by Balises 

--- Document Chunk 2529 ---
3.6.2.1.1 All location and profile data transmitted by a balise shall refer t o the location reference 

--- Document Chunk 2530 ---
and orientation of the balise group to which the balise belongs. 

--- Document Chunk 2531 ---
3.6.2.1.2 Exception: Regarding infill information see section 3.6.2.3.1. 

--- Document Chunk 2532 ---
3.6.2.2 Data Transmitted by Radio from RBC 

--- Document Chunk 2533 ---
3.6.2.2.1 All location and profile data transmitt ed from the RBC shall refer to the location 

--- Document Chunk 2534 ---
reference and orientation of the LRBG given in the same message. 

--- Document Chunk 2535 ---
3.6.2.2.2 For the LRBG the following requirements have to be met: 

--- Document Chunk 2536 ---
a) The on -board equipment shall use the last balise group passed as a reference 

--- Document Chunk 2537 ---
when reporting its position to the RBC (in the following termed as LRBGONB). Only  

--- Document Chunk 2538 ---
 balise groups marked as linked and contained in the previously received linking 

--- Document Chunk 2539 ---
information, if linking information is used on-board 

--- Document Chunk 2540 ---
 or  

--- Document Chunk 2541 ---
 the last balise group not marked as unlinked, if no linking was used when this 

--- Document Chunk 2542 ---
balise group was passed 

--- Document Chunk 2543 ---
shall be regarded. 

--- Document Chunk 2544 ---
b) The RBC shall use the last relevant balise group which was reported by the on -

--- Document Chunk 2545 ---
board equipment as a reference (in the following termed as LRBG RBC). At a certain 

--- Document Chunk 2546 ---
moment LRBGRBC and LRBGONB can be different. 

--- Document Chunk 2547 ---
c) The on-board equipment shall be able to accept information referring to one of at 

--- Document Chunk 2548 ---
least eight LRBGONB last reported to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 2549 ---
3.6.2.2.2.1 Exception to a): When on-board position is unknown or when position data has been 

--- Document Chunk 2550 ---
deleted during SoM proce dure, the on-board equipment shall use an LRBG identifier 

--- Document Chunk 2551 ---
set to "unknown" until the onboard has validated its position again by passing a balise 

--- Document Chunk 2552 ---
group.

3.6.2.2.2.2 Exception to b): When the RBC has received from the onboard an unknown position, 

--- Document Chunk 2565 ---
or an invalid position  which it is not able to confirm during SoM procedure, the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 2566 ---
shall use an LRBG identifier set to "unknown" until it receives a position report from the 

--- Document Chunk 2567 ---
onboard having validated its position by passing a balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2568 ---
3.6.2.2.2.3 Regarding c): From the time it has re ported an unknown position, or an invalid position 

--- Document Chunk 2569 ---
during SoM procedure, to the time it has received from the RBC a message with an 

--- Document Chunk 2570 ---
LRBG not set to “unknown”, the on -board equipment shall also be able to accept 

--- Document Chunk 2571 ---
messages from the RBC containing LRBG “unknown”.

3.6.2.4.1.1 Note: Regarding infill information see section 3.6.2.3. 

--- Document Chunk 2672 ---
3.6.2.4.2 The orientation of data transmitted by a loop is determined by the EOLM information

3.6.3 Validity direction of transmitted Information 

--- Document Chunk 2676 ---
3.6.3.1 General 

--- Document Chunk 2677 ---
3.6.3.1.1 The direction for which transmitted information is valid shall refer to: 

--- Document Chunk 2678 ---
a) the direction of the LRBG for information sent by radio 

--- Document Chunk 2679 ---
b) the direction of the balise group sending the information. 

--- Document Chunk 2680 ---
3.6.3.1.2 Data transmitted to the on -board equipment (by balise or radio) shall be identified as 

--- Document Chunk 2681 ---
being valid for 

--- Document Chunk 2682 ---
a) both directions 

--- Document Chunk 2683 ---
b) the nominal direction

c) the reverse direction 

--- Document Chunk 2685 ---
of the referenced balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 2686 ---
3.6.3.1.2.1 Deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 2687 ---
3.6.3.1.3 When receiving information from any transmission medium, the ERTMS/ETCS on-

--- Document Chunk 2688 ---
board equipment shall only take into account information valid for its orientation. Other 

--- Document Chunk 2689 ---
information shall be ignored. Exception : for SL , PS  and SH engines, balise group 

--- Document Chunk 2690 ---
crossing direction shall be considered. 

--- Document Chunk 2691 ---
3.6.3.1.3.1 If the train position is unknown, data received from any transmission medium valid for 

--- Document Chunk 2692 ---
one direction only (nominal or reverse) shall be rejected by the onboard equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 2693 ---
Data valid for both directions shall be evaluated (see section 4.8). 

--- Document Chunk 2694 ---
3.6.3.1.4 If no co -ordinate system has been assigned to a single balise group, data transmitted 

--- Document Chunk 2695 ---
by trackside, which refers to that balise group requiring the co -ordinate system to be 

--- Document Chunk 2696 ---
known (i.e. all data which are only valid for one direction (nominal or reverse) ) shall be 

--- Document Chunk 2697 ---
rejected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Data valid for both directions shall 

--- Document Chunk 2698 ---
be evaluated (see section 4.8). 

--- Document Chunk 2699 ---
3.6.3.1.4.1 Exception: if not rejected due to balise group message consistency  check (see

3.6.3.2.4 According to Figure 12 the structure for non -continuous profile data shall allow to 

--- Document Chunk 2766 ---
contain multiple elements (value(n) for length(n)) inside the profile.  

--- Document Chunk 2767 ---
a) Distance to the start of each element (value(n) for length(n)) shall be given as 

--- Document Chunk 2768 ---
unsigned incremental values , each increment representing the distance between  

--- Document Chunk 2769 ---
starts of element (n) and element (n-1).

c) Each value (n) may represent a single value or a set of data.

3.6.3.2.5 It shall be possible for the RBC to shift the location reference, e.g., after a change of

train orientation or running direction. 

--- Document Chunk 2777 ---
3.6.3.2.5.1 Justification: Refer to Figure 13. To make it possible  to shift the location reference if – 

--- Document Chunk 2778 ---
due to the location of the LRBG and the start location – distance (1) would become a 

--- Document Chunk 2779 ---
negative value.

3.6.4.2.2 Note: The confidence interval increases in relation to the distance travelled from the 

--- Document Chunk 2833 ---
LRBG depending on the accuracy of odometer equipment until it is reset when another 

--- Document Chunk 2834 ---
balise group becomes the LRBG. 

--- Document Chunk 2835 ---
3.6.4.2.3 The value of the Location Accuracy shall be determined by Linking information if 

--- Document Chunk 2836 ---
available, if not, by the corresponding National Value, or the corresponding Default 

--- Document Chunk 2837 ---
Value if the National Value is not applicable. 

--- Document Chunk 2838 ---
3.6.4.3 When another balise group becomes the LRBG or when evaluating (see section 4.8) 

--- Document Chunk 2839 ---
location related trackside information, which is referred to a previously received balise 

--- Document Chunk 2840 ---
group different from the LRBG, all the location related information shall be reloca ted by 

--- Document Chunk 2841 ---
subtracting from the distances that are counted from the reference balise group of the 

--- Document Chunk 2842 ---
location related information: 

--- Document Chunk 2843 ---
a) the distance between the reference balise group of the location related information 

--- Document Chunk 2844 ---
and the LRBG, retrieved from linking information if it is available and it includes both 

--- Document Chunk 2845 ---
the reference balise group and the LRBG, OR 

--- Document Chunk 2846 ---
b) in all other cases, the estimated travelled distance between the reference balise 

--- Document Chunk 2847 ---
group of the location related information and the LRBG. 

--- Document Chunk 2848 ---
3.6.4.3.1 Justification: it is always the t rackside responsibility to provide linking in due course, 

--- Document Chunk 2849 ---
knowing this rule; if the location related information is to be used in situations where 

--- Document Chunk 2850 ---
linking is not provided (e.g. TSR transmitted by balise group marked as unlinked), the 

--- Document Chunk 2851 ---
trackside can include provisions, if deemed necessary, when engineering the distance 

--- Document Chunk 2852 ---
information.

3.8.1.1 The following characteristics can be used in a Movement Authority (see Figure 17: 

--- Document Chunk 3401 ---
Structure of an MA): 

--- Document Chunk 3402 ---
a) The End Of Authority (EOA) is the location to which the train is authorised to move.

Principles 

--- Document Chunk 3412 ---
Page 48/200 

--- Document Chunk 3413 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 3414 ---
b) The Target Speed at the EOA is the permitted speed at the EOA; when the target 

--- Document Chunk 3415 ---
speed is not zero, the EOA is called the Limit of Authority (LOA). This target speed 

--- Document Chunk 3416 ---
can be time limited. 

--- Document Chunk 3417 ---
c) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the EOA that can be 

--- Document Chunk 3418 ---
reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a hazardous situation.  

--- Document Chunk 3419 ---
d) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location 

--- Document Chunk 3420 ---
beyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a 

--- Document Chunk 3421 ---
risk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined 

--- Document Chunk 3422 ---
time. 

--- Document Chunk 3423 ---
e) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity 

--- Document Chunk 3424 ---
of the EOA, when the target speed is z ero. One release speed can be associated 

--- Document Chunk 3425 ---
with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap. Release speed can also 

--- Document Chunk 3426 ---
be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4). 

--- Document Chunk 3427 ---
f) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section. 

--- Document Chunk 3428 ---
 A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for 

--- Document Chunk 3429 ---
the revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is 

--- Document Chunk 3430 ---
called the Section time-out.  

--- Document Chunk 3431 ---
 In addition, a second t ime-out value can be attached to the End Section of the 

--- Document Chunk 3432 ---
MA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it 

--- Document Chunk 3433 ---
is occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out. 

--- Document Chunk 3434 ---
3.8.1.2 The values of the time -outs possibly given in an M A shall take into account the time 

--- Document Chunk 3435 ---
elapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message. 

--- Document Chunk 3436 ---
3.8.1.3 Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list): 

--- Document Chunk 3437 ---
 the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to 

--- Document Chunk 3438 ---
fixed block principles) 

--- Document Chunk 3439 ---
 the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to 

--- Document Chunk 3440 ---
moving block principles) 

--- Document Chunk 3441 ---
 the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current 

--- Document Chunk 3442 ---
direction of movement of the train (both for f ixed and moving block mode of 

--- Document Chunk 3443 ---
operation)

3.8.1.4 Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put 

--- Document Chunk 3445 ---
at disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver 

--- Document Chunk 3446 ---
should misjudge the stopping distanc e for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can 

--- Document Chunk 3447 ---
be used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 3448 ---
3.8.1.5 Note: Time -out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations 

--- Document Chunk 3449 ---
depending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on -board will only reflect the 

--- Document Chunk 3450 ---
situation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:

a) Section time -out or time -out for the speed at the EOA/LOA: When a signalman 

--- Document Chunk 3463 ---
requests a route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the app roaching 

--- Document Chunk 3464 ---
train. 

--- Document Chunk 3465 ---
b) End Section time -out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 

--- Document Chunk 3466 ---
automatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a 

--- Document Chunk 3467 ---
standstill before any switches inside the route can be moved. 

--- Document Chunk 3468 ---
c) Time-out for an ov erlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the 

--- Document Chunk 3469 ---
overlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that 

--- Document Chunk 3470 ---
the train has successfully stopped before its end of authority. If the overlap is still 

--- Document Chunk 3471 ---
unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap. 

--- Document Chunk 3472 ---
3.8.1.6 Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance 

--- Document Chunk 3473 ---
to End Of Authority (with target speed equal to zero) a target speed higher than zero 

--- Document Chunk 3474 ---
can be given (speed at LOA, Li mit Of Authority). It is the responsibility of the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 3475 ---
to ensure that the safe distance beyond the EOA/LOA is long enough to brake the train 

--- Document Chunk 3476 ---
from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the 

--- Document Chunk 3477 ---
responsibility of the on -board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is 

--- Document Chunk 3478 ---
received when the Limit of Authority is passed.  

--- Document Chunk 3479 ---
3.8.2 MA request to the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 3480 ---
3.8.2.1 It shall be possible for the on -board equipment to request a new Movement Authority 

--- Document Chunk 3481 ---
from the RBC.  

--- Document Chunk 3482 ---
3.8.2.2 The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.  

--- Document Chunk 3483 ---
3.8.2.3 In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available: 

--- Document Chunk 3484 ---
a) A defined time before the train reaches the pre-indication location (see section 3.13) 

--- Document Chunk 3485 ---
for the EOA/LOA assuming it is running at the warning speed. 

--- Document Chunk 3486 ---
b) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap 

--- Document Chunk 3487 ---
timer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires. 

--- Document Chunk 3488 ---
3.8.2.3.1 Regards to the above possibilities, the MA request shall be triggere d when the train 

--- Document Chunk 3489 ---
front has passed the resulting location (regards a)/ time (regards b) 

--- Document Chunk 3490 ---
3.8.2.4 It shall be possible to define whether the MA request shall be repeated until a new MA 

--- Document Chunk 3491 ---
is received or not and if so, the time between each repetition. 

--- Document Chunk 3492 ---
3.8.2.5 The given data shall be valid until new MA request parameters are given from the 

--- Document Chunk 3493 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 3494 ---
3.8.2.6 In case no MA request parameters are stored on-board and following an MA request 

--- Document Chunk 3495 ---
no MA has been received, the request shall be repeated with a repetition cycle 

--- Document Chunk 3496 ---
according to a fixed value (see appendix).

--- Document Chunk 3517 ---
3.8.2.8 Together with the MA request the on -board shall inform the RBC about the reason(s) 

--- Document Chunk 3518 ---
why the MA request is sent:

the end of the last section 

--- Document Chunk 3533 ---
b) Danger point information (distance from end of section to danger point, release

3.8.3.4 The Section timer stop location shall be inside of the corresponding section. 

--- Document Chunk 3563 ---
3.8.3.4.1 Note: the End Section and Overlap timer start locations may be outside their 

--- Document Chunk 3564 ---
corresponding section. One example can be seen referring to figure 22c: An infill MA 

--- Document Chunk 3565 ---
towards a signal at stop will replace the previous End Section by a new short End 

--- Document Chunk 3566 ---
Section starting at the infill location reference and ending at the next main signal, 

--- Document Chunk 3567 ---
however the End Section and Overlap timer start locations still have to be consistent 

--- Document Chunk 3568 ---
with the Int erlocking timer start locations. Another example is when a timer start 

--- Document Chunk 3569 ---
location is in rear of the LRBG. 

--- Document Chunk 3570 ---
3.8.3.5 In level 3, no time-outs shall be used. 

--- Document Chunk 3571 ---
3.8.3.5.1 Note: For level 3 functionality the split of responsibility between the RBC and the 

--- Document Chunk 3572 ---
Interlocking has to be consi dered. Time-out of routes and related overlap can not be 

--- Document Chunk 3573 ---
based on train position reports since the position report can be delayed compared to 

--- Document Chunk 3574 ---
the real position of the train. The route release and revocation of routes can not be

carried out by the interlocking until permitted by the RBC.

3.8.3.7.1 Justification: The balise group is no t necessarily placed at the same location as the 

--- Document Chunk 3594 ---
signal and thus an infill message (which includes the same information as the balise

group at the main signal) could change the location of the EOA to a position closer to 

--- Document Chunk 3596 ---
the train.  

--- Document Chunk 3597 ---
3.8.3.8 In case the main signal  is at danger in level 1, the on -board shall supervise the given 

--- Document Chunk 3598 ---
distance (specified in section 3.8.3.7) as the distance to EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 3599 ---
3.8.3.9 When an MA is transmitted by radio from the RBC, the length of the first section shall 

--- Document Chunk 3600 ---

3.8.4.1.1 The End Section timer shall be starte d on -board when the train passes the End 

--- Document Chunk 3635 ---
Section timer start location given by trackside with its max safe front end. 

--- Document Chunk 3636 ---
3.8.4.1.2 When the End Section timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 3637 ---
trackside, the following shall apply: 

--- Document Chunk 3638 ---
a) The EOA/LOA shall be withdrawn to the current position of the train . Refer to 

--- Document Chunk 3639 ---
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 

--- Document Chunk 3640 ---
which shall be deleted accordingly; 

--- Document Chunk 3641 ---
b) if any, a non zero target speed value at the EOA/LOA shall be set to zero. 

--- Document Chunk 3642 ---
3.8.4.1.3 In case no End Section timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an 

--- Document Chunk 3643 ---
End Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, the on -

--- Document Chunk 3644 ---
board shall consider that the End Section timer value became greater than its time -out 

--- Document Chunk 3645 ---
value and apply 3.8.4.1.2. 

--- Document Chunk 3646 ---
3.8.4.1.3.1 Justification: in this case the train is already beyond the timer start location, therefore it 

--- Document Chunk 3647 ---
is impossible to determine when that location was crossed and so what share of the 

--- Document Chunk 3648 ---
time-out value has elapsed since the crossing e vent. The safe assumption is to 

--- Document Chunk 3649 ---
consider that the time-out value has been exceeded and therefore that the End Section 

--- Document Chunk 3650 ---
will soon be released by the Interlocking. 

--- Document Chunk 3651 ---
3.8.4.1.4 In case an End Section timer is already running when the on -board receives a new MA 

--- Document Chunk 3652 ---
with an End  Section timer start location in rear of the max safe front end of the train, 

--- Document Chunk 3653 ---
the on-board shall keep the End Section timer running but replace the time -out value 

--- Document Chunk 3654 ---
with the value received with the new MA. 

--- Document Chunk 3655 ---
3.8.4.1.4.1 Justification: this allows repetition of the MA via RBC (e.g. acknowledgment of current

--- Document Chunk 3689 ---
b) For Level 1: at the time of passage over the first encountered balise of the balise

3.8.4.3.2 When the LOA speed timer value  becomes greater than the time-out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 3695 ---

3.8.4.4.3 If the train comes to a standstill after the Overlap timer has been started, the on-board

3.8.4.4.4 In case no Overlap timer is running when the on -board receives a new MA with an

3.8.4.6.2 An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the on -board equipment is in FS or LS 

--- Document Chunk 3760 ---
mode. 

--- Document Chunk 3761 ---
3.8.4.6.3 The infill information shall include the identity of the balise group at the next main 

--- Document Chunk 3762 ---
signal i.e. the identity of the balise group giving the information that is t ransmitted in 

--- Document Chunk 3763 ---
advance by the infill device. 

--- Document Chunk 3764 ---
3.8.4.6.4 An infill MA shall be evaluated on -board only if the linking information, regarding the 

--- Document Chunk 3765 ---
main signal balise group to which it refers, is available. 

--- Document Chunk 3766 ---
3.8.4.6.5 The on-board shall start a Section timer for each section beyond the next main signal: 

--- Document Chunk 3767 ---
a) When the infill information is received from a balise group at the time of passing the 

--- Document Chunk 3768 ---
first encountered balise of the infill balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 3769 ---
b) When the infill information is received from a loop at the time of receiving the loop 

--- Document Chunk 3770 ---

--- Document Chunk 3771 ---
c) When the infill information is received from a radio infill unit at the value of the time 

--- Document Chunk 3772 ---

--- Document Chunk 3773 ---
3.8.5 MA Update 

--- Document Chunk 3774 ---
3.8.5.1 A new MA shall replace a previously received MA in the following ways: 

--- Document Chunk 3775 ---
a) When the new MA is given from a balise group at a main signal (i.e. not infill 

--- Document Chunk 3776 ---
information) or from the RBC all data included in the previous MA shall be replaced 

--- Document Chunk 3777 ---
by the new data.  

--- Document Chunk 3778 ---
b) When the new MA is given as infill information all data beyond the announced 

--- Document Chunk 3779 ---
balise group at the next main signal shall be replaced. 

--- Document Chunk 3780 ---
3.8.5.1.1 Note: This refers to all information included in the MA as listed in section 3.8.1.1 and 

--- Document Chunk 3781 ---
the Signalling related speed restriction (see section 3.11.6). 

--- Document Chunk 3782 ---
3.8.5.1.2 When an infill MA is  received, the on -board shall start a new MA section at the infill 

--- Document Chunk 3783 ---
location reference, i.e. the balise group at the next main signal (see 3.6.2.3.1). 

--- Document Chunk 3784 ---
3.8.5.1.3 If the SvL defined from the new MA is closer than the one supervised with the former 

--- Document Chunk 3785 ---
MA, this shall be considered by the on-board equipment as an MA shortening. Refer to 

--- Document Chunk 3786 ---
appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based information stored on -board, 

--- Document Chunk 3787 ---
which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 3788 ---
3.8.5.1.4 If a new MA defines an SvL while the on -board was supervising an LOA, this shall 

--- Document Chunk 3789 ---
always be considered by the on -board equipment as an MA shortening regardless of 

--- Document Chunk 3790 ---
the SvL location. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of location based 

--- Document Chunk 3791 ---
information stored on-board, which shall be deleted accordingly. 

--- Document Chunk 3792 ---
3.8.5.2 It shall be pos sible to update the length of the current section by means of 

--- Document Chunk 3793 ---
repositioning information (see section 3.8.5.3).

3.9.1.1.1 Note: If the information transmitted by Balise groups, Euroloops, and Radio includes 

--- Document Chunk 4104 ---
infill information, those devices are also identified as infill devices. 

--- Document Chunk 4105 ---
3.9.1.2 The principle used for the infill information shall be the same independent of 

--- Document Chunk 4106 ---
transmission media. 

--- Document Chunk 4107 ---
3.9.1.3 If the on -board system is not equipped with the infill transmission media as requested 

--- Document Chunk 4108 ---
by the announcement balise group, the announcement information shall be ignored by 

--- Document Chunk 4109 ---
the on -board equipment and the train shall proceed according to the previously 

--- Document Chunk 4110 ---
received information.  

--- Document Chunk 4111 ---
3.9.1.4 Note: No additional description is needed for infill by balise group (other than already 

--- Document Chunk 4112 ---
covered in previous chapters). 

--- Document Chunk 4113 ---
3.9.2 Infill by loop 

--- Document Chunk 4114 ---
3.9.2.1 An End Of Loop Marker (EOLM) is by definition a device to mark the beginning or the 

--- Document Chunk 4115 ---
end of a loop. When receiving this information, the on-board equipment knows that it is 

--- Document Chunk 4116 ---
entering/leaving a track equipped with a loop. In unidirectional applications it shall be 

--- Document Chunk 4117 ---
possible to have an EOLM only at the entry side of a loop. 

--- Document Chunk 4118 ---
3.9.2.2 Balise groups shall be used as EOL Ms. They act as an EOLM by sending the EOLM 

--- Document Chunk 4119 ---
information to the passing train.  

--- Document Chunk 4120 ---
3.9.2.3 EOLMs have an orientation that is identical to the balise group orientation. The general 

--- Document Chunk 4121 ---
rules for balise orientation therefore also apply to EOLMs.

3.9.2.4 EOLM information might be contained in a balise group that contains other information.  

--- Document Chunk 4134 ---
3.9.2.5 The EOLM shall send the identity of the announced loop. 

--- Document Chunk 4135 ---

--- Document Chunk 4138 ---
3.9.2.8 Deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 4139 ---
3.9.2.9 The following information shall be sent in advance by the EOLM to prepare for 

--- Document Chunk 4140 ---
reception of the loop information: 

--- Document Chunk 4141 ---
 Loop identity used to identify the loop.  

--- Document Chunk 4142 ---
 Key to select the spread spectrum key necessary to receive the loop telegrams. 

--- Document Chunk 4143 ---
 Distance to the loop giving the distance from th e EOLM to the location from where 

--- Document Chunk 4144 ---
on loop messages can be received.  

--- Document Chunk 4145 ---
 Length of the loop giving the length of the loop over which messages can be 

--- Document Chunk 4146 ---
received.  

--- Document Chunk 4147 ---
 Indicator telling the on -board whether the orientation of the loop is identical or 

--- Document Chunk 4148 ---
reverse to the orientation of the announcing EOLM.  

--- Document Chunk 4149 ---
3.9.2.10 The on-board shall be prepared to receive messages from the Euroloop after passing 

--- Document Chunk 4150 ---
the EOLM. 

--- Document Chunk 4151 ---
3.9.2.11 When the on -board equipment reads the next main signal balise group or when it 

--- Document Chunk 4152 ---
detects that the next main signal balise group wa s missed, new infill information 

--- Document Chunk 4153 ---
possibly received from the loop shall be ignored. 

--- Document Chunk 4154 ---
3.9.2.12 The distances given in an EOLM (distance to loop, length of loop) are used for 

--- Document Chunk 4155 ---
diagnostic purpose only. They shall therefore not be used to restrict reception of loop 

--- Document Chunk 4156 ---
telegrams to specific locations. 

--- Document Chunk 4157 ---
3.9.3 Infill by radio 

--- Document Chunk 4158 ---
3.9.3.1 In level 1 areas it shall be possible to send to the on -board equipment orders to 

--- Document Chunk 4159 ---
establish/terminate a communication session with a radio infill unit.  

--- Document Chunk 4160 ---
3.9.3.2 The orders shall be sent via balise groups or via Radio Infill units. 

--- Document Chunk 4161 ---
3.9.3.3 The order to establish a communication session shall be ignored: 

--- Document Chunk 4162 ---
a) Intentionally deleted.  

--- Document Chunk 4163 ---
b) If the on-board equipment does not include radio.  

--- Document Chunk 4164 ---
3.9.3.4 If the on -board equipment includes radio, the communication session shall be

--- Document Chunk 4178 ---
groups is received by an on -board equipment, connected with another radio infill 

--- Document Chunk 4179 ---
unit(s), two cases may arise: 

--- Document Chunk 4180 ---
3.9.3.5.1 Case 1: the on -board can handle only one communication session at a time. In this 

--- Document Chunk 4181 ---
case, the onboard shall (unless §3.9.3.5.1.1 applies): 

--- Document Chunk 4182 ---
a) terminate the existing communication session at the location indicated in the order 

--- Document Chunk 4183 ---
b) establish a communication session wi th the RIU indicated in the order as soon as 

--- Document Chunk 4184 ---
action a) is completed. 

--- Document Chunk 4185 ---
3.9.3.5.1.1 The order shall be ignored in case it refers to an RIU with which a session is currently 

--- Document Chunk 4186 ---
being established or is already established. 

--- Document Chunk 4187 ---
3.9.3.5.2 Case 2: the on -board can handle more than one communi cation session at a time. In 

--- Document Chunk 4188 ---
this case, at the location indicated in the order the on-board shall: 

--- Document Chunk 4189 ---
a) terminate any communication session existing with RIU(s) not indicated in the order 

--- Document Chunk 4190 ---
b) as soon as a new communication session can be handled, establish a 

--- Document Chunk 4191 ---
communication session with the RIU indicated in the order, unless currently being 

--- Document Chunk 4192 ---
established or already established with the said RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 4193 ---
3.9.3.6 If the order to establish a communication session with a radio infill unit sent via Radio 

--- Document Chunk 4194 ---
Infill unit is received by an on-board equipment: 

--- Document Chunk 4195 ---
a) If the on -board can handle only one communication session, the order shall be 

--- Document Chunk 4196 ---
ignored. 

--- Document Chunk 4197 ---
b) If the on -board can handle two communication sessions simultaneously  and only 

--- Document Chunk 4198 ---
one session is ongoing , the existing communication session shall be maintaine d 

--- Document Chunk 4199 ---
and the new one shall be established. 

--- Document Chunk 4200 ---
c) If the on -board can handle two communication sessions simultaneously and two 

--- Document Chunk 4201 ---
sessions are ongoing, then the communication session related to the current infill 

--- Document Chunk 4202 ---
area shall be maintained, the other one shall be termina ted and the new one shall 

--- Document Chunk 4203 ---
be established. 

--- Document Chunk 4204 ---
3.9.3.7 A Radio Infill Unit shall not initiate a communication session with an on -board 

--- Document Chunk 4205 ---
equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 4206 ---
3.9.3.8 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via balise groups shall 

--- Document Chunk 4207 ---
be sent together with the following radio infill area information: 

--- Document Chunk 4208 ---
a) Location where to perform the action (referred to the balise group containing the 

--- Document Chunk 4209 ---
order).Note: if the action is to establish a communication session, this location 

--- Document Chunk 4210 ---
marks the beginning of the Radio Infill Area. 

--- Document Chunk 4211 ---
b) Next main signal  balise group identifier ( ignored by the on -board if the action is 

--- Document Chunk 4212 ---
Terminate communication session).Note: the reference location of this balise group 

--- Document Chunk 4213 ---
marks the end of the Radio Infill Area.

3.9.3.8.1 The order to establish/terminate a communication session sent via Radio Infill units 

--- Document Chunk 4226 ---
(see 3.5.3.6) shall not be sent together with any radio infill area information. 

--- Document Chunk 4227 ---
3.9.3.9 The establishment of a communication session for radio infill shall not change the 

--- Document Chunk 4228 ---
operational level of the on -board i.e. the information in the balise grou p shall be taken 

--- Document Chunk 4229 ---
into account as usual in level 1.  

--- Document Chunk 4230 ---
3.9.3.10 The on-board equipment shall inform the radio infill unit 

--- Document Chunk 4231 ---
a) As soon as the location indicated in the order sent via balise groups is passed (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 4232 ---
entry of the train in the infill area) 

--- Document Chunk 4233 ---
b) As soon as the next m ain signal balise group indicated in the order sent via balise

groups is read or the on-board equipment detects that it was missed.  

--- Document Chunk 4235 ---
3.9.3.11 The information sent to the radio infill unit by the on-board equipment shall include 

--- Document Chunk 4236 ---
a) Train identity (ETCS-ID of the on-board equipment) 

--- Document Chunk 4237 ---
b) Position report 

--- Document Chunk 4238 ---
c) Identifier of the next main signal balise group 

--- Document Chunk 4239 ---
d) Time stamp 

--- Document Chunk 4240 ---
3.9.3.11.1 Justification:  

--- Document Chunk 4241 ---
a) The train identity is used for conformity with other train to track messages 

--- Document Chunk 4242 ---
b) The identifier of the next main signal balise group allows the radio infil l unit to 

--- Document Chunk 4243 ---
identify safely where the train is going, even in the case of a points area 

--- Document Chunk 4244 ---
3.9.3.12 As soon as the radio infill unit is informed that a train has entered an infill area  under 

--- Document Chunk 4245 ---
its responsibility, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 4246 ---
a) Terminate a possible previous sending of infill in formation to the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 4247 ---
equipment, AND 

--- Document Chunk 4248 ---
b) Send cyclically the infill information corresponding to the message currently sent by 

--- Document Chunk 4249 ---
the next main signal balise group indicated in the information from the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 4250 ---
equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 4251 ---
3.9.3.12.1 Justification: case a) refers to the possibility that a report from the on-board equipment, 

--- Document Chunk 4252 ---
after having passed the previous main signal, was lost. 

--- Document Chunk 4253 ---

radio connection between RBC and on-board equipment to get a quick reaction.  

--- Document Chunk 4335 ---
3.10.1.2 An emergency message shall contain an identifier decided by the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 4336 ---
3.10.1.3 The same identifier shall be used in case the emergency message is repeated. 

--- Document Chunk 4337 ---
3.10.1.3.1 If the on -board receives a new message with the sa me identifier it shall replace the 

--- Document Chunk 4338 ---
previous one. 

--- Document Chunk 4339 ---
3.10.1.4 Each emergency message to an on -board equipment shall be acknowledged, using 

--- Document Chunk 4340 ---
the corresponding emergency message identification number. 

--- Document Chunk 4341 ---
3.10.1.4.1 Note: This acknowledgement informs the RBC about the use of the emergen cy 

--- Document Chunk 4342 ---
message by on -board equipment and is independent from the general

--- Document Chunk 4346 ---
stop message.  

--- Document Chunk 4347 ---
3.10.2.2 A conditional emergency stop message shall contain the information of a new stop 

--- Document Chunk 4348 ---
location, referred to the LRBG. In case, when receiving this message 

--- Document Chunk 4349 ---
 the train has already passed with its min safe front end the new stop location, the

emergency stop message shall be rejected and the RBC shall be informed. 

--- Document Chunk 4351 ---

--- Document Chunk 4386 ---
kinds of Static Speed Restrictions and considering the End of Authority/Limit Of 

--- Document Chunk 4387 ---

--- Document Chunk 4389 ---
level. 

--- Document Chunk 4390 ---
3.11.2 Definition of Static Speed Restriction 

--- Document Chunk 4391 ---
3.11.2.1 Static Speed Restrictions are imposed by the trackside infrastructure, the train 

--- Document Chunk 4392 ---
characteristics, the signalling and the mode of the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 4393 ---
3.11.2.2 There are eleven categories of Static Speed Restrictions:   

--- Document Chunk 4394 ---
a) Static Speed Profile (SSP) 

--- Document Chunk 4395 ---
b) Axle load Speed Profile (ASP) 

--- Document Chunk 4396 ---
c) Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSR) 

--- Document Chunk 4397 ---
d) Maximum Train Speed 

--- Document Chunk 4398 ---
e) Signalling related speed restriction (only level 1) 

--- Document Chunk 4399 ---
f) Mode related Speed Restriction. 

--- Document Chunk 4400 ---
g) STM Max speed (for details refer to Subset-035) 

--- Document Chunk 4401 ---
h) STM System speed (for details refer to Subset-035) 

--- Document Chunk 4402 ---
i) Level Crossing speed restriction (LX SR)

3.11.3 Static Speed Profile (SSP) 

--- Document Chunk 4433 ---
3.11.3.1.1 The Static Speed Profile (SSP) is a description of the fixed speed restrictions of a 

--- Document Chunk 4434 ---
given piece of track. The speed restrictions can be related to e.g. maximum line speed, 

--- Document Chunk 4435 ---
curves, points, tunnel profiles, bridges. 

--- Document Chunk 4436 ---
3.11.3.1.2 The Static Speed Profile is based on factors, which are both track and train dependent. 

--- Document Chunk 4437 ---
The relationship between track and train characteristics determine s the individual 

--- Document Chunk 4438 ---
Static Speed Profile for each train.  

--- Document Chunk 4439 ---
3.11.3.1.3 It shall be possible for every element (distance between two discontinuities) of a static 

--- Document Chunk 4440 ---
speed profile to define, if a transition to a higher speed limit than the speed limit 

--- Document Chunk 4441 ---
specified for this element is permitted before the complete train has left the element.

3.11.3.2.1 It shall be possible to transmit several Static Speed Profile Categories; one Basic SSP 

--- Document Chunk 4455 ---
category and specific SSP categories related to the international train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4456 ---
3.11.3.2.1.1 The specific SSP categories are decomposed into two types: 

--- Document Chunk 4457 ---
a) The “Cant Deficiency” SSP categories: the cant deficiency value assigned to one 

--- Document Chunk 4458 ---
category shall define the maximum speed, determined by suspension design, at 

--- Document Chunk 4459 ---
which a particular train can traverse a curve and thus can be used to set a specific 

--- Document Chunk 4460 ---
speed limit in a curve with regards to this category. 

--- Document Chunk 4461 ---
b) The “other specific” SSP categories: it groups all other specific SSP categories 

--- Document Chunk 4462 ---
corresponding to the other international train categories 

--- Document Chunk 4463 ---
3.11.3.2.1.2 Whenever the type of specific SSP cat egory is not explicitly specified in the 

--- Document Chunk 4464 ---
following requirements, it shall be interpreted as being applicable for both types of 

--- Document Chunk 4465 ---
specific SSP categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4466 ---
3.11.3.2.2 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS trackside shall: 

--- Document Chunk 4467 ---
a) always give the Basic SSP, wh ich shall be considered as the default “Cant 

--- Document Chunk 4468 ---
Deficiency” SSP 

--- Document Chunk 4469 ---
b) optionally give one or more specific SSPs 

--- Document Chunk 4470 ---
c) specify, for each “other specific” SSP, whether it replaces or not the “Cant 

--- Document Chunk 4471 ---
Deficiency” SSP as selected by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment according to 

--- Document Chunk 4472 ---
3.11.3.2.3 

--- Document Chunk 4473 ---
3.11.3.2.3 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 4474 ---
select the SSP best suiting its “Cant Deficiency” train category, according to the 

--- Document Chunk 4475 ---
following order of preference: 

--- Document Chunk 4476 ---
a) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP matching its “Cant Deficiency” train category, 

--- Document Chunk 4477 ---
OR 

--- Document Chunk 4478 ---
b) if available, the “Cant Deficiency” SSP with the highest Cant Deficiency value below 

--- Document Chunk 4479 ---
the value of its “Cant Deficiency” train category, OR

3.11.3.2.6 For each part of the Static Speed Profile, t he ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in a 

--- Document Chunk 4485 ---
train belonging to at least one or more “other international” train categories shall use 

--- Document Chunk 4486 ---
the most restrictive speed amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 4487 ---
a) the ” Cant Deficiency” SSP as selected in 3.11.3.2.3, only if none of the “other 

--- Document Chunk 4488 ---
specific” SSP categories matching the train categories replaces the ” Cant

3.11.3.3.1 A maximum of 31 train categories shall be defined to match the SSP categories. 16 

--- Document Chunk 4505 ---
“Cant Deficiency” train categories and 15 “other international” train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4506 ---
3.11.3.3.2 A train shall always belong to one and only one “Cant Deficiency”  train category and 

--- Document Chunk 4507 ---
may optionally belong to one or more “other international” train categories. 

--- Document Chunk 4508 ---
3.11.3.3.3 The train category(ies) to which a train belongs shall be a part of its Train Data. 

--- Document Chunk 4509 ---
3.11.4 Axle load Speed Profile 

--- Document Chunk 4510 ---
3.11.4.1 It shall be possible to define an Axle load Speed Profile as a non-continuous profile. 

--- Document Chunk 4511 ---
3.11.4.2 For each section with a speed restriction due to axle load, the different speed value(s) 

--- Document Chunk 4512 ---
and for which minimum axle load category this speed value(s) applies shall be 

--- Document Chunk 4513 ---
specified. 

--- Document Chunk 4514 ---
3.11.4.2.1 Note: Different speed restrictions depending on the axle load category can be 

--- Document Chunk 4515 ---
applicable to the same distance. 

--- Document Chunk 4516 ---
3.11.4.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment  shall consider the most restrictive speed 

--- Document Chunk 4517 ---
restriction that is associated with any axle load category  lower than, or equal to th at of 

--- Document Chunk 4518 ---
the train. 

--- Document Chunk 4519 ---
3.11.4.4 For trains with an axle load category lower than the minimum axle load category given

--- Document Chunk 4521 ---
restriction due to axle load. 

--- Document Chunk 4522 ---
3.11.4.5 The initial state for Axle load Speed Profile shall be “no restriction due to axle load”. 

--- Document Chunk 4523 ---
3.11.4.6 Whether a speed increase after the axle load speed restriction shall be delayed with

3.11.5 Temporary Speed Restrictions 

--- Document Chunk 4527 ---
3.11.5.1 The temporary speed restriction is defined in order to enable a separate category of

track infrastructure speed restriction, which can be used for working areas etc. 

--- Document Chunk 4529 ---
3.11.5.2 All Temporary Speed Restrictions shall be independent of each other. This mea ns that 

--- Document Chunk 4530 ---
an individual Temporary Speed Restriction shall not affect, nor be affected by, any

--- Document Chunk 4548 ---
3.11.5.5 Each Temporary Speed Restriction shall have an identity to make it possible to revoke

deleted (operational requirement: will be executed due to the mode change). 

--- Document Chunk 4563 ---
3.11.5.11 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 4564 ---
3.11.5.12 It shall be possible for the RBC to order an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment in Level 

--- Document Chunk 4565 ---

--- Document Chunk 4566 ---
3.11.5.13 When ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has accepted an order to re ject revocable

3.13 Speed and distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 5180 ---
3.13.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 5181 ---
3.13.1.1 The speed and distance monitoring is the supervision of the speed of the train versus 

--- Document Chunk 5182 ---
its position, in order to assure that the train remains within the given speed and 

--- Document Chunk 5183 ---
distance limits. 

--- Document Chunk 5184 ---
3.13.1.1.1 Note: The speed and distance monitorin g of the on -board can only assure this when 

--- Document Chunk 5185 ---
the following necessary conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 5186 ---
 Brake system of the train functions as specified 

--- Document Chunk 5187 ---
 wheel/rail adhesion is sufficient for the required safe deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 5188 ---
 Brake characteristics (and other Train Data)  are correctly entered into the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 5189 ---
(automatic or by driver) 

--- Document Chunk 5190 ---
3.13.1.2 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment triggers brake commands and revokes 

--- Document Chunk 5191 ---
them, it may also receive status information if the brakes are applied or released. 

--- Document Chunk 5192 ---
However, it cannot be made res ponsible if brake control circuits outside the equipment 

--- Document Chunk 5193 ---
fail. Also the way the brakes are released by the driver after a revocation of a brake 

--- Document Chunk 5194 ---
command is an implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 5195 ---
3.13.1.3 Figure 28 gives an overview of the main elements c ontributing to the speed and 

--- Document Chunk 5196 ---
distance monitoring. These elements (inputs, functions and outputs) are detailed in the 

--- Document Chunk 5197 ---

3.13.2.1.2 However, railway brakes have a statistical behaviour and braking distances vary within 

--- Document Chunk 5357 ---
the typical distribution for a given condition. Correction factors are therefore 

--- Document Chunk 5358 ---
incorporated for the speed and distance monitoring. 

--- Document Chunk 5359 ---
3.13.2.1.3 The correction factors will allow obtaining, from the nominal emergency braking 

--- Document Chunk 5360 ---
performance of the train, the minimum emergency braking performances that are 

--- Document Chunk 5361 ---
required for reference conditions set by trackside.

3.13.2.2 Train related inputs 

--- Document Chunk 5363 ---
3.13.2.2.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 5364 ---
3.13.2.2.1.1 The train related inputs to be considered for the speed and distance monitoring are: 

--- Document Chunk 5365 ---
a) Traction model 

--- Document Chunk 5366 ---
b) Braking models (brake build up time and speed dependent deceleration) or brake 

--- Document Chunk 5367 ---
percentage 

--- Document Chunk 5368 ---
c) Brake position 

--- Document Chunk 5369 ---
d) Special brakes 

--- Document Chunk 5370 ---
e) Service brake interface 

--- Document Chunk 5371 ---
f) Traction cut-off interface 

--- Document Chunk 5372 ---
g) On-board correction factors 

--- Document Chunk 5373 ---
h) Nominal rotating mass 

--- Document Chunk 5374 ---
i) Train length 

--- Document Chunk 5375 ---
j) Fixed values related to speed and distance monitoring 

--- Document Chunk 5376 ---
k)  Train related speed restriction (i.e. the maximum train speed) 

--- Document Chunk 5377 ---
3.13.2.2.1.2 All train related inputs except the fixed values are acquired as Train Data (see 

--- Document Chunk 5378 ---
3.18.3.2 items b) c) and d)). 

--- Document Chunk 5379 ---
3.13.2.2.1.3 The speed and distance m onitoring shall use braking models acquired as Train 

--- Document Chunk 5380 ---
Data, unless the brake percentage is acquired as Train Data and the conversion model 

--- Document Chunk 5381 ---
is applicable (see 3.13.3.2 for its validity limits). 

--- Document Chunk 5382 ---
3.13.2.2.2 Traction model 

--- Document Chunk 5383 ---
3.13.2.2.2.1 The traction model shall be given as a step funct ion as indicated in Figure 29. It 

--- Document Chunk 5384 ---
shall describe the time delay T_traction_cut_off from the traction cut -off command by 

--- Document Chunk 5385 ---
the on -board (t0) to the moment the acceleration due to traction (A_traction) is 

--- Document Chunk 5386 ---

3.13.2.2.3.1.1 The deceleration due to braking shall be given as a step function of the speed. 

--- Document Chunk 5412 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.2 It shal l be possible to define up to seven steps for each speed dependent 

--- Document Chunk 5413 ---

--- Document Chunk 5414 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.3 Note: An example with 4 steps is given in Figure 30. A_brake(V) is calculated as 

--- Document Chunk 5415 ---
follows: 

--- Document Chunk 5416 ---
 A_brake = AD_0  when 0 ≤ speed ≤ V1 

--- Document Chunk 5417 ---
 A_brake = AD_1  when V1 < speed ≤ V2 

--- Document Chunk 5418 ---

3.13.2.2.3.1.4 The last step o f A_brake(V) shall by definition be considered as open ended, i.e. it 

--- Document Chunk 5442 ---
has no upper speed limit. 

--- Document Chunk 5443 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.5 The model shall be applicable only after full build up of the braking effort (see a_full 

--- Document Chunk 5444 ---
in Figure 31) 

--- Document Chunk 5445 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.6 The model shall be used for the  emergency brake nominal deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 5446 ---
(A_brake_emergency(V)), for the full service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 

--- Document Chunk 5447 ---
and for the normal service brake deceleration (A_brake_normal_service(V)). 

--- Document Chunk 5448 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.7 It shall be possible to define individual speed dependent deceleration models of 

--- Document Chunk 5449 ---
A_brake_emergency(V) and A_brake_service(V)  for each combination of use of 

--- Document Chunk 5450 ---
regenerative brake, eddy current brake and magnetic shoe brake. 

--- Document Chunk 5451 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.8 Note: Individual deceleration models may be equal, thereby avoiding the influence 

--- Document Chunk 5452 ---
of a specifi c brake on A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V). However, the 

--- Document Chunk 5453 ---
choice to take into account or not the contribution of a specific brake for 

--- Document Chunk 5454 ---
A_brake_emergency(V) or A_brake_service(V) is only rolling stock dependent, not an 

--- Document Chunk 5455 ---
ETCS implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 5456 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.9 It shall be possible to define up to two sets of three models of 

--- Document Chunk 5457 ---
A_brake_normal_service(V): 

--- Document Chunk 5458 ---
a) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Freight train in G” 

--- Document Chunk 5459 ---
b) one set applicable when the brake position is in “Passenger train in P” or “Freight 

--- Document Chunk 5460 ---
train in P” 

--- Document Chunk 5461 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.10 A set of A_brake_normal_service(V) shall be defined as a function of the full 

--- Document Chunk 5462 ---
service brake deceleration at zero speed, A_brake_service(V=0): 

--- Document Chunk 5463 ---
If A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB01 

--- Document Chunk 5464 ---
A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_0(V) 

--- Document Chunk 5465 ---
if A_SB01 < A_brake_service(V = 0)  A_SB12 

--- Document Chunk 5466 ---

A_brake_normal_service(V) = A_brake_normal_service_2(V) 

--- Document Chunk 5469 ---
3.13.2.2.3.1.11 Note: the two pivot values A_SB01 and A_SB12 are part of the

3.13.2.2.3.2.2 The model for the brake build up time shall be given as a step function as explained

--- Document Chunk 5495 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.3 In Figure 31, the following time intervals are defined: 

--- Document Chunk 5496 ---
a) T_brake_react (t0…t1) is the interval between the command of the brake by the on -

--- Document Chunk 5497 ---
board and the moment the brake force starts to build up. 

--- Document Chunk 5498 ---
b) T_brake_increase (t1...t2) is the interval in which the brake force increases from the 

--- Document Chunk 5499 ---
zero to the moment when 95% of full brake power is reached. 

--- Document Chunk 5500 ---
c) T_brake_build_up (t0...t3) is the equivalent brake build up time. 

--- Document Chunk 5501 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.4 The equivalent brake build up time (T_brake_build_up) is defined as 

--- Document Chunk 5502 ---
T_brake_build_up = T_brake_react + 0.5*T_brake_increase. 

--- Document Chunk 5503 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.5 This model for T_brake_build_up shall be used for the emergency brake 

--- Document Chunk 5504 ---
(T_brake_emergency) and for the full service brake (T_brake_service). 

--- Document Chunk 5505 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.6 Note: The equivale nt brake build up time is a safe approximation. In the beginning 

--- Document Chunk 5506 ---
of the build -up time the model assumes a smaller deceleration, in the later part this is 

--- Document Chunk 5507 ---
compensated by a higher deceleration. 

--- Document Chunk 5508 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.7 Note: T_brake_react and T_brake_increase are indicated in Figure 31 for 

--- Document Chunk 5509 ---
completeness reasons; only T_brake_build_up is to be considered as an input for the 

--- Document Chunk 5510 ---
speed and distance monitoring function. 

--- Document Chunk 5511 ---
3.13.2.2.3.2.8 It shall be possible to define individual values of T_brake_emergency and 

--- Document Chunk 5512 ---
T_brake_service for each  combination of use of regenerative brake, eddy current 

--- Document Chunk 5513 ---
brake, magnetic shoe brake and Ep brake.

3.13.2.2.4 Brake Position

3.13.2.2.4.1 The brake position shall be set to one of the following three values:

3.13.3 Conversion Models 

--- Document Chunk 5897 ---
3.13.3.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 5898 ---
3.13.3.1.1 For trains with variable composition (loco hauled trains), the brake characteristics can 

--- Document Chunk 5899 ---
vary together with the composition of the train. In this case, it is not convenient to  pre-

--- Document Chunk 5900 ---
program the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only 

--- Document Chunk 5901 ---
practical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include 

--- Document Chunk 5902 ---
them into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from 

--- Document Chunk 5903 ---
the driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models 

--- Document Chunk 5904 ---
are therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake 

--- Document Chunk 5905 ---
percentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model. 

--- Document Chunk 5906 ---
3.13.3.1.2 Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake 

--- Document Chunk 5907 ---
percentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 5908 ---
specifications. 

--- Document Chunk 5909 ---
3.13.3.2 Applicability of the conversion models 

--- Document Chunk 5910 ---
3.13.3.2.1 The conversion models shall be used by the on -board e quipment if the brake 

--- Document Chunk 5911 ---
percentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the 

--- Document Chunk 5912 ---
brake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the 

--- Document Chunk 5913 ---
conversion models: 

--- Document Chunk 5914 ---
a) 0 ≤ V ≤ 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h 

--- Document Chunk 5915 ---
b) 30 ≤ λ ≤ 250, where λ is the brake percentage in % 

--- Document Chunk 5916 ---
c) 0 ≤ L ≤ Lmax, where L is the train length in m  and where Lmax = 900 m if the brake 

--- Document Chunk 5917 ---
position is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500  m if the brake p osition is “Freight 

--- Document Chunk 5918 ---
train in P” or “Freight train in G” 

--- Document Chunk 5919 ---
3.13.3.2.1.1 Note: The overspeed above the maximum train speed which may occur due to the 

--- Document Chunk 5920 ---
ceiling speed margins is taken into account in the definition of the conversion model. 

--- Document Chunk 5921 ---
3.13.3.2.2 For trains not fitting into at least one of those validity limits, it is still possible to acquire 

--- Document Chunk 5922 ---
the brake percentage as Train Data, but the conversion models are not applicable, 

--- Document Chunk 5923 ---
which means that braking models (i.e. pre -programmed deceleration profiles and 

--- Document Chunk 5924 ---
brake build up times) shall be used by the speed and distance monitoring function.

3.13.4.2.1 Assuming that a fictive train front end would be at any locati on between the current 

--- Document Chunk 6051 ---
(actual) train front end location and the SvL, the acceleration due to the gradient shall 

--- Document Chunk 6052 ---
be determined using the lowest (taking the sign into account) gradient value given by 

--- Document Chunk 6053 ---
the gradient profile between the location of the fictive train front end and the location of 

--- Document Chunk 6054 ---
the fictive train rear end (see Figure 35). 

--- Document Chunk 6055 ---
3.13.4.3 Rotating mass 

--- Document Chunk 6056 ---
3.13.4.3.1 The influence of gradients shall be compensated for the rotating mass of the train (see 

--- Document Chunk 6057 ---
Figure 35). 

--- Document Chunk 6058 ---
3.13.4.3.1.1 Note: Since the rotating mass works like a flywheel (rotating inertia), the effect of 

--- Document Chunk 6059 ---
the gradient is reduced. Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating 

--- Document Chunk 6060 ---
mass, not braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy 

--- Document Chunk 6061 ---
added to the train when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. 

--- Document Chunk 6062 ---
This can be observed as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same 

--- Document Chunk 6063 ---
train with part of the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to 

--- Document Chunk 6064 ---
H2, the same amount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is 

--- Document Chunk 6065 ---
converted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear 

--- Document Chunk 6066 ---
forward motion. The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for 

--- Document Chunk 6067 ---
the train without rotating mass. 

--- Document Chunk 6068 ---
3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it 

--- Document Chunk 6069 ---
is already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 6070 ---
3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used: 

--- Document Chunk 6071 ---
a) If M_rotating_nom is unknown: 

--- Document Chunk 6072 ---
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max) 

--- Document Chunk 6073 ---
 Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min) 

--- Document Chunk 6074 ---
b) If M_rotating_nom is known: 

--- Document Chunk 6075 ---
 Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom) 

--- Document Chunk 6076 ---
 Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom) 

--- Document Chunk 6077 ---
Legend: 

--- Document Chunk 6078 ---
A_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient 

--- Document Chunk 6079 ---
g = 9.81 m/s2 - acceleration of gravity in m/s2 

--- Document Chunk 6080 ---
grad = gradient values in ‰ (positive = uphill) 

--- Document Chunk 6081 ---
M_rotating_nom = nominal rotating mass (part of train data) as a percentage of the 

--- Document Chunk 6082 ---
total train weight 

--- Document Chunk 6083 ---
M_rotating_max = maximum possible rotating mass (see A3.1) as a percentage of the

3.13.8 Determination of targets and brake deceleration curves 

--- Document Chunk 6443 ---
3.13.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 6444 ---
3.13.8.1.1 A target is defined by a target location and a target speed, to which the train must 

--- Document Chunk 6445 ---
decelerate before reaching the target location. 

--- Document Chunk 6446 ---
3.13.8.1.2 For that purpose, the on -board equipment shall use brake deceleration curves related 

--- Document Chunk 6447 ---
to the supervised targets, from the deceleration values as specified in sections 

--- Document Chunk 6448 ---
3.13.6.2.1, 3.13.6.3.1and 3.13.6.4. 

--- Document Chunk 6449 ---
3.13.8.1.3 These deceleration values being speed and distance dependent, a brake deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 6450 ---
curve shall be calculated piecewise, i.e. it shall be composed of interconnected arcs of 

--- Document Chunk 6451 ---
parabola, each one being based on one of the speed/distance dependent deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 6452 ---
values (see Figure 38). 

--- Document Chunk 6453 ---
3.13.8.2 Determination of the supervised targets 

--- Document Chunk 6454 ---
3.13.8.2.1 The on -board shall continuously supervise a list of targets, which may include the 

--- Document Chunk 6455 ---
following types of target: 

--- Document Chunk 6456 ---
a) the locations corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP (if any), which are in 

--- Document Chunk 6457 ---
advance of the max safe front end of the train 

--- Document Chunk 6458 ---
b) the Limit of Authority (LOA), if the target speed at the EOA/LOA is not equal to zero 

--- Document Chunk 6459 ---
c) the End of Authority (EOA) and the Supervised Location (SvL), if the target speed at 

--- Document Chunk 6460 ---
the EOA is equal to zero 

--- Document Chunk 6461 ---
d) the location deduced from the maximum permitted distance to run in Staff 

--- Document Chunk 6462 ---
Responsible, with a target speed zero 

--- Document Chunk 6463 ---
3.13.8.2.1.1 Note: depending on the information received from trackside a nd the position of the 

--- Document Chunk 6464 ---
train, the list of supervised targets may be empty. 

--- Document Chunk 6465 ---
3.13.8.2.2 The list of supervised targets shall be re -evaluated when any of the elements it is built 

--- Document Chunk 6466 ---
of is changed (e.g. new MA and/or track description accepted on -board, EOA and/or 

--- Document Chunk 6467 ---
SvL tempo rarily supervised at the start location of a mode profile, update of stored 

--- Document Chunk 6468 ---
information in specific situations (see sections A.3.4 and 4.10)). 

--- Document Chunk 6469 ---
3.13.8.2.3 A target corresponding to a speed decrease of the MRSP shall be removed from the 

--- Document Chunk 6470 ---
list of supervised targets when the max safe front end of the train has passed the 

--- Document Chunk 6471 ---
target location.

deceleration A_normal_service(V,d). The foot of a GUI curve (i.e. the location where

3.13.9.1.2 The purpose of the emergency brake intervention supervision limit is to assure that the

train will remain within the various limits (in distance/speed) imposed by the trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 6582 ---
3.13.9.1.3 The purpose of all other supervision limits is to assist the driver in preventing an

--- Document Chunk 6585 ---
3.13.9.2 Ceiling supervision limits

3.13.9.3.2.2 The time elapsed between the Emergency brake intervention and the full application

of the braking effort is reached (EBD) shall be split into two parts: 

--- Document Chunk 6726 ---
a) Time during which the traction effort is still present: T_traction 

--- Document Chunk 6727 ---
b) Remaining time during which the traction effort is not present: T_berem 

--- Document Chunk 6728 ---
3.13.9.3.2.3 The traction time (T_Traction) shall be defined as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 6729 ---
a) when the traction cut-off is implemented: 

--- Document Chunk 6730 ---
T_traction = MAX((T_traction_cut_off - (T_warning + T_bs2)) ; 0). 

--- Document Chunk 6731 ---
b) when the traction cut-off is not implemented: T_traction = T_traction_cut_off 

--- Document Chunk 6732 ---
3.13.9.3.2.4 Note: When the traction cut -off is implemented, the traction cut -off command is 

--- Document Chunk 6733 ---
triggered when passing the warning limit. The term (T_warning + T_bs2) in the 

--- Document Chunk 6734 ---
equation above takes this into accou nt, assuming that the warning limit is derived from 

--- Document Chunk 6735 ---
the EBD. 

--- Document Chunk 6736 ---
3.13.9.3.2.5 T_bs2 and T_warning are defined in sections 3.13.9.3.3 and 3.13.9.3.4. 

--- Document Chunk 6737 ---
3.13.9.3.2.6 The remaining time with no traction (T_berem) shall be equal to MA X(T_be - 

--- Document Chunk 6738 ---
T_traction ; 0). 

--- Document Chunk 6739 ---
3.13.9.3.2.7 Note: T_Traction exceeding T_be is rather a theoretical case, but is nevertheless 

--- Document Chunk 6740 ---
included to make the specifications complete. 

--- Document Chunk 6741 ---
3.13.9.3.2.8 During T_traction, the estimated acceleration (A_est1) shall be the one measured at 

--- Document Chunk 6742 ---
the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to positive or null values. 

--- Document Chunk 6743 ---
3.13.9.3.2.9 If T_be > T_traction, the estimated acceleration during T_berem (A_est2) shall be 

--- Document Chunk 6744 ---
the one measured at the moment when the calculation is made, but limited to values 

--- Document Chunk 6745 ---
between 0 and +0.4m/s2. 

--- Document Chunk 6746 ---
3.13.9.3.2.10 The compensated speed and the distance travelled during the time elapsed 

--- Document Chunk 6747 ---

3.13.9.3.3.4 If both the service brake command and the service brake feedback are available for

respective fixed values of 0s and T_bs2_locked, until the target location is passed or

3.13.9.3.5.7.1 Note: the re -use of the same distance travelled and speed increase between the 

--- Document Chunk 7065 ---
Permitted speed supervision limit and the EBD, as for the estimated speed (see Figure 

--- Document Chunk 7066 ---
49), leads to an overestimation/underestimation of the Permitted speed to be displayed 

--- Document Chunk 7067 ---
to the driver. This simplification, which avoids the need of an iterated calculation, is 

--- Document Chunk 7068 ---
however acceptable and necessary since the error made tends to zero when the train

To avoid very low values when T_bs is small, a minimum is defined for T_indication, 

--- Document Chunk 7233 ---
giving the driver always enough time to operate the brake. 

--- Document Chunk 7234 ---
3.13.9.3.6.4 If the service brake feedback interface is available for use then T_indication = 5s. 

--- Document Chunk 7235 ---
3.13.9.4 Release speed supervision limits 

--- Document Chunk 7236 ---
3.13.9.4.1 The release speed is a special ceiling speed limit, applicable in the vicinity of the EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 7237 ---
The EBI supervision limit shall b e equal to the release speed. There is no SBI, W, P, I 

--- Document Chunk 7238 ---
supervision limit associated to the release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 7239 ---
3.13.9.4.2 Note: The release speed may be necessary for two reasons. One is that a train has to 

--- Document Chunk 7240 ---
be able to approach the EOA where the permitted speed reaches zer o and might be 

--- Document Chunk 7241 ---
too restrictive to permit acceptable driving due to inaccuracy of the measured distance. 

--- Document Chunk 7242 ---
The other reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the 

--- Document Chunk 7243 ---
balise when the signal clears. For these two reasons a (low) release speed may be 

--- Document Chunk 7244 ---
given from trackside or may be calculated on board, based on the distance from the 

--- Document Chunk 7245 ---
EOA to the Supervised Location. 

--- Document Chunk 7246 ---
3.13.9.4.3 With each MA, it shall be possible for the trackside to: 

--- Document Chunk 7247 ---
a) Give the value of the release speed directly to the on-board, OR 

--- Document Chunk 7248 ---
b) Instruct the on-board to calculate the release speed, OR 

--- Document Chunk 7249 ---
c) Instruct the on-board to use the national value. 

--- Document Chunk 7250 ---
3.13.9.4.4 In case the MA does not identify the variant to be used or in case of LOA, no release 

--- Document Chunk 7251 ---
speed shall be supervised. 

--- Document Chunk 7252 ---
3.13.9.4.5 Note: When the release speed is giv en as a fixed value from trackside, the 

--- Document Chunk 7253 ---
ERTMS/ETCS system cannot be responsible for stopping the train in rear of the 

--- Document Chunk 7254 ---
Supervised Location. In this case, it is the full responsibility of the infrastructure 

--- Document Chunk 7255 ---
manager to set the appropriate release speed with r egard to the risk of passing the 

--- Document Chunk 7256 ---
Supervised Location. 

--- Document Chunk 7257 ---
3.13.9.4.6 The start location of the release speed monitoring (i.e. where the EBI supervision limit 

--- Document Chunk 7258 ---
related to EBD is replaced with an EBI supervision limit equal to the release speed 

--- Document Chunk 7259 ---
value) shall be the location of the most restrictive SBI supervision limit among the SBI1 

--- Document Chunk 7260 ---
related to EOA, the SBI2 related to SvL  and, when the Release Speed is calculated 

--- Document Chunk 7261 ---
on-board, the SBI2 supervision limit(s) related to other target(s), if any, between the 

--- Document Chunk 7262 ---
Trip location related to the EOA and the SvL,  calculated for the Release Speed value, 

--- Document Chunk 7263 ---
taking into account the following assumptions: 

--- Document Chunk 7264 ---
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero” 

--- Document Chunk 7265 ---
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 

--- Document Chunk 7266 ---
measurement shall be set to a value calculated from the release speed, as defined

3.13.9.4.8.2.1 Note: The above formulas are intended to prevent the calculated release speed 

--- Document Chunk 7432 ---
from fluctuating, according to the distanc e, speed and acceleration measurements. It 

--- Document Chunk 7433 ---
allows calculating the release speed only once, for a given on-board reference 

--- Document Chunk 7434 ---
location, unless 

--- Document Chunk 7435 ---
 the distance confidence interval exceeds a predicted one, which is based on 

--- Document Chunk 7436 ---
the assumption that the whole distance be tween the current on -board 

--- Document Chunk 7437 ---
reference location and the EOA would be travelled with SUBSET-041 

--- Document Chunk 7438 ---
odometer performance values  and without any update of the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 7439 ---
reference location, or 

--- Document Chunk 7440 ---
 the speed under reading amount (V_ura) exceeds the SUBSET -041 

--- Document Chunk 7441 ---
performance value 

--- Document Chunk 7442 ---
Whenever the on-board reference location is updated (e.g. new LRBG), the release 

--- Document Chunk 7443 ---
speed will however be recalculated and will increase with a step. This behaviour is 

--- Document Chunk 7444 ---
acceptable from an operational point of view. 

--- Document Chunk 7445 ---
3.13.9.4.8.2.2 Note: The method chosen (e.g. iterativ e algorithm) to compute the release speed is 

--- Document Chunk 7446 ---
an implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 7447 ---
3.13.9.4.9 If the release speed (Figure 52 box 1 gives an example when it is calculated on-board)

3.13.9.5 Pre-indication location 

--- Document Chunk 7490 ---
3.13.9.5.1 The purpose of the pre -indication is to inform the driver that he is approaching an area 

--- Document Chunk 7491 ---
where he has to operate the service brake in order to brake to a target. The pre -

--- Document Chunk 7492 ---
indication is used to switch from ceiling speed monitoring to target speed monitoring. 

--- Document Chunk 7493 ---
3.13.9.5.2 For an EBD based target, the on -board shall calculate the pre -indication location as 

--- Document Chunk 7494 ---
follows. 

--- Document Chunk 7495 ---
3.13.9.5.3 Starting from the first element of the MRSP (i.e. from the start location of the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 7496 ---
stored track description), th e on -board shall calculate the location of the Indication 

--- Document Chunk 7497 ---
supervision limit, valid for the speed of the MRSP element, taking into account the 

--- Document Chunk 7498 ---
following assumptions: 

--- Document Chunk 7499 ---
a) the estimated acceleration shall be set to “zero” 

--- Document Chunk 7500 ---
b) if not inhibited by National Value, the compensation of the inaccuracy of the speed 

--- Document Chunk 7501 ---
measurement shall be set to a value, calculated from the speed of the MRSP 

--- Document Chunk 7502 ---
element, as defined in SUBSET-041 § 5.3.1.2: V_delta0ind = f41(V_MRSP-n) 

--- Document Chunk 7503 ---
c) If available for use, the service brake feedback shall not have a ny effect: T_bs1ind 

--- Document Chunk 7504 ---
and T_bs2ind shall be set to T_bs if the service brake command is available for use, 

--- Document Chunk 7505 ---
otherwise they shall be set to “zero”. T_tractionind and T_beremind shall be defined 

--- Document Chunk 7506 ---
as in 3.13.9.3.2 for T_traction and T_berem by substituting T_bs2 with T_bs2ind 

--- Document Chunk 7507 ---
3.13.9.5.4 To calculate the EBI supervision limit, the same formulas defined above with V_est , 

--- Document Chunk 7508 ---
T_traction, T_berem and V_ delta0 shall be applied, by substituting V_est with 

--- Document Chunk 7509 ---
V_MRSP-n, T_traction with T_tractionind, T_berem with T_beremind  and V_ delta0 

--- Document Chunk 7510 ---

3.13.9.5.11 Note 1: For ergonomic reasons, the location of a pre -indication is independent of the 

--- Document Chunk 7605 ---
estimated speed. If the pre -indication would be derived from an EBD or SBD curve 

--- Document Chunk 7606 ---
according to the estimated speed, then when the train is running at low speed the

driver would see the permitted speed already decrease while the DMI is still in ceiling

3.13.10.1.3 Ceiling speed monitoring is the speed supervision in the area where the train can run 

--- Document Chunk 7652 ---
with the speed as defined by the MRSP without the need to brake to a target. 

--- Document Chunk 7653 ---
3.13.10.1.4 Target speed monitoring is the speed and distance supervision in the area where the 

--- Document Chunk 7654 ---
specific information related to a target is displayed to the driver and within which the 

--- Document Chunk 7655 ---
train brakes to a target. 

--- Document Chunk 7656 ---
3.13.10.1.5 Release speed monitoring is  the speed and distance supervision in the area close to 

--- Document Chunk 7657 ---
the EOA where the train is allowed to run with release speed to approach the EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 7658 ---
3.13.10.2 General requirements 

--- Document Chunk 7659 ---
3.13.10.2.1 The train speed indicated to the driver shall be identical to the speed used for the 

--- Document Chunk 7660 ---
speed monitoring. This shall be the estimated speed. 

--- Document Chunk 7661 ---
3.13.10.2.2 Once a Train Interface command (traction cut -off, service brake or emergency brake) 

--- Document Chunk 7662 ---
is triggered, the on -board shall apply it until its corresponding revocation condition is 

--- Document Chunk 7663 ---
met. 

--- Document Chunk 7664 ---
3.13.10.2.3 If there is no on-board interface with the service brake or if the use of the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 7665 ---
command is not allowed by a National Value (only in Target speed monitoring),

--- Document Chunk 7837 ---
supervision limits, described in sections 3.13.9.2 and 3.13.9.3, are used to determine

the commands to the Train Interface and the information displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 7839 ---
3.13.10.4.2 The on-board equipment shall display to the driver the target information (target speed 

--- Document Chunk 7840 ---
and distance to target) related to one target at a time: the Most Restrictive Displayed 

--- Document Chunk 7841 ---
Target (MRDT). The MRDT shall be defined as the target of which the braking to target 

--- Document Chunk 7842 ---
Permitted speed supervision limit (refer to section 3.13.9.3.5), calculated for the 

--- Document Chunk 7843 ---
current position of the train, is the lowest one amongst the supervised targets:

3.13.10.4.11 The braking to target Indication supervision limit is not used for estimated speeds 

--- Document Chunk 8483 ---
higher than V_MRSP. However the location of the Indication supervision limit, valid for 

--- Document Chunk 8484 ---
V_MRSP, shall be used for estimated speeds  higher than V_MRSP in order to 

--- Document Chunk 8485 ---
discriminate whether information related to the Indication status has to be displayed to 

--- Document Chunk 8486 ---
the driver. In other terms, for estimated speeds above V_MRSP, this location of the 

--- Document Chunk 8487 ---
Indication supervision limit defines a pre -indication display area starting from the pre -

--- Document Chunk 8488 ---
indication location and ending at this location. 

--- Document Chunk 8489 ---
3.13.10.4.12 Note: Figure 56 shows the parts of the ceiling speed and braking to target 

--- Document Chunk 8490 ---
supervision limits, which are used in target speed monitoring to tri gger the brake 

--- Document Chunk 8491 ---
commands and the transitions between supervision statuses. It does not show what is 

--- Document Chunk 8492 ---
displayed to the driver: in particular, the braking to target Permitted supervision limit is 

--- Document Chunk 8493 ---
displayed (even if not supervised) for values lower than the release speed.

the direction controller. 

--- Document Chunk 8967 ---
3.14.2.2 The Roll Away Protection (RAP) shall prevent the train  from moving in a direction, 

--- Document Chunk 8968 ---
which conflicts with the current position of the direction controller in the active desk. 

--- Document Chunk 8969 ---

3.15.1 RBC/RBC Handover 

--- Document Chunk 9012 ---
3.15.1.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 9013 ---
3.15.1.1.1 Trains with one or more radio(s) shall be able to pass from one RBC area to another 

--- Document Chunk 9014 ---
automatically (without driver action). 

--- Document Chunk 9015 ---
3.15.1.1.2 Since an RBC is unable to know whether the on -board is able to manage one or two 

--- Document Chunk 9016 ---
communication session(s) at once, the following principles are applicable for both 

--- Document Chunk 9017 ---
cases. Thereby, the RBCs will have the same behaviour in both cases. 

--- Document Chunk 9018 ---
3.15.1.1.3 An RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with one communication session available 

--- Document Chunk 9019 ---
may result in performance penalties since it will not be able to “prepare” (session 

--- Document Chunk 9020 ---
establishment, version determination, …) the expected supervision by the Ac cepting 

--- Document Chunk 9021 ---
RBC until the on-board disconnects from the Handing Over RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9022 ---
3.15.1.1.4 In level 3, trains following the one with one communication session available will 

--- Document Chunk 9023 ---
always suffer performance penalties since no more position reports will be issued from 

--- Document Chunk 9024 ---
the disconnection from the Handing Over RBC until the connection to the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 9025 ---
RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9026 ---
3.15.1.2 Handing Over RBC 

--- Document Chunk 9027 ---
3.15.1.2.1 When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another 

--- Document Chunk 9028 ---
RBC area, it shall send: 

--- Document Chunk 9029 ---
a) Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 9030 ---
b) To the Accepting RBC the following information: 

--- Document Chunk 9031 ---
 The ETCS identity of the on-board equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 9032 ---
 The border location that will be passed by the train when entering the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 9033 ---
RBC area; 

--- Document Chunk 9034 ---
 Current mode of the on-board equipment; 

--- Document Chunk 9035 ---
 Optionally, Train Data; 

--- Document Chunk 9036 ---
 Optionally, for a non-leading engine, the ETCS identity of the leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 9037 ---
3.15.1.2.2 The Handing Over RBC shall not send information to an on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 9038 ---
concerning the route in advance of the border without receiving the corresponding 

--- Document Chunk 9039 ---
information from the Accepting RBC.

--- Document Chunk 9079 ---
RBC that the train has entered the Accepting RBC area.

equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 9097 ---
3.15.1.2.9 When the Handing Over RBC detects that the transition to the Accepting RBC has to

the train identification). 

--- Document Chunk 9100 ---
3.15.1.2.9.1 Note: For instance, the cancellation procedure can be triggered by:

--- Document Chunk 9111 ---
3.15.1.3.2 It is up to the on -board equipment to manage the establishment of one commun ication 

--- Document Chunk 9112 ---
session and the release of the other one: 

--- Document Chunk 9113 ---
a) If it is able to handle two communication sessions at the same time, the radio 

--- Document Chunk 9114 ---
session with the Accepting RBC shall be established as soon as it receives the RBC 

--- Document Chunk 9115 ---
transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 9116 ---
b) If it is able to handle on e communication session only at a given time, it shall wait 

--- Document Chunk 9117 ---
until the session with the Handing over RBC is terminated due to crossing the 

--- Document Chunk 9118 ---
border (refer to 3.5.5.1e and 3.15.1.2.7) and then establish the session with the 

--- Document Chunk 9119 ---
Accepting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9120 ---
3.15.1.3.3 As soon as the on -board equipment has established the session with the Accepting

--- Document Chunk 9196 ---
3.15.3.1 ERTMS/ETCS shall allow Splitting and Joining using the normal supervision functions 

--- Document Chunk 9197 ---
available (e.g. On-sight, Shunting). 

--- Document Chunk 9198 ---
3.15.3.2 Splitting only refers to the case that the two resulting trains contain at least one 

--- Document Chunk 9199 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment each. 

--- Document Chunk 9200 ---
3.15.3.2.1 Note: This must be ensured by operational procedures.

--- Document Chunk 9202 ---
operation has been correctly completed (technical aspect and/or operational aspect). 

--- Document Chunk 9203 ---
3.15.3.4 Justification: ERTMS/ETCS is not able to provide this information. Splitting and Joining 

--- Document Chunk 9204 ---
shall require the fulfilment of operating rules ensuring that a Splitting/Joining operation 

--- Document Chunk 9205 ---
has been correctly completed (e.g. physical disconnection). 

--- Document Chunk 9206 ---
3.15.4 Reversing of movement direction 

--- Document Chunk 9207 ---
3.15.4.1 It shall be possible to send in advance to an on -board equipment information about

areas, where initiation of reversing of movement di rection is possible, i.e. change the 

--- Document Chunk 9209 ---
direction of train movement without changing the train orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 9210 ---
3.15.4.1.1 A new reversing area given from the trackside shall replace the one already available

3.15.4.4 While at standstill with the front end of the train inside the indicated area, it shall be 

--- Document Chunk 9302 ---
possible for the driver to reverse the direction of movement. 

--- Document Chunk 9303 ---
3.15.4.5 The on -board equipment shall allow movement in the direction opposite to the train 

--- Document Chunk 9304 ---
orientation, supervising it according to distance and speed received. 

--- Document Chunk 9305 ---
3.15.4.6 Note: level transitions and RBC/RBC handovers are not handled by the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 9306 ---
on-board equipment when in Reversing mode. 

--- Document Chunk 9307 ---
3.15.4.7 When at standstill the on -board equipment shall inform the driver if the reve rsing of 

--- Document Chunk 9308 ---
movement is permitted. 

--- Document Chunk 9309 ---
3.15.4.8 If the end location of the maximum distance to run in the opposite direction is passed

3.15.5 Track ahead free 

--- Document Chunk 9312 ---
3.15.5.1 In a level 2/3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be able to handle a 

--- Document Chunk 9313 ---
track ahead free request given by the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 9314 ---
3.15.5.2 The track ahead free request from the RBC shall indicate to the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 9315 ---
a) at which location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall begin to display the 

--- Document Chunk 9316 ---
request to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 9317 ---
b) at wh ich location the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop to display the 

--- Document Chunk 9318 ---
request to the driver (in case the driver did not acknowledge). 

--- Document Chunk 9319 ---
3.15.5.3 The driver shall have the possibility to acknowledge the track ahead free request 

--- Document Chunk 9320 ---
(meaning the driver confirms that the  track between the head of the train and the next 

--- Document Chunk 9321 ---
signal or board marking signal position is free). 

--- Document Chunk 9322 ---
3.15.5.4 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall stop 

--- Document Chunk 9323 ---
displaying the request, and shall inform the RBC that the track ahead is free. 

--- Document Chunk 9324 ---
3.15.5.5 There shall be no restrictive consequence by the on -board system if the driver does 

--- Document Chunk 9325 ---
not acknowledge.

possible to send from balises or RBC data to be forwarded to a National System. 

--- Document Chunk 9349 ---
3.15.6.5.1 Note: Definition of what qualifies as  “data to be forwarded to a National System” is

3.15.7 Tolerance of Big Metal Mass 

--- Document Chunk 9352 ---
3.15.7.1 Big metal object in the track, exceeding the limits for big metal masses as def ined in 

--- Document Chunk 9353 ---
Subset-036, section 6.5.2 “Metal Masses in the Track” may trigger an alarm reporting 

--- Document Chunk 9354 ---
a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission function. 

--- Document Chunk 9355 ---
3.15.7.2 In Levels 0/NTC, the alarms which may be triggered by metal masses shall be ignored 

--- Document Chunk 9356 ---
for a defined dista nce (see A3.1). If the alarm persists for a longer distance the 

--- Document Chunk 9357 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trigger a safety reaction. 

--- Document Chunk 9358 ---
3.15.7.3 Justification: Ignoring the alarm for a defined distance eliminates the need to equip all 

--- Document Chunk 9359 ---
excessive big metal masses with track c ondition “Big Metal Mass” outside ETCS fitted 

--- Document Chunk 9360 ---
areas. 

--- Document Chunk 9361 ---
3.15.8 Cold Movement Detection 

--- Document Chunk 9362 ---
3.15.8.1 After being switched off (i.e. once in No Power mode), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9363 ---
equipment shall be capable, if fitted with, to detect and record whether the engine has 

--- Document Chunk 9364 ---
been moved or not, during a period of at least 72 hours. 

--- Document Chunk 9365 ---
3.15.8.2 When powered on again, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, if 

--- Document Chunk 9366 ---
available, the memorised information about cold movement in order to update the 

--- Document Chunk 9367 ---
status of information stored by on -board equipment (see chap ter 4 section 4.11 for 

--- Document Chunk 9368 ---
details). 

--- Document Chunk 9369 ---
3.15.8.3 Note: information memorised by Cold Movement Detection function is considered as 

--- Document Chunk 9370 ---
not available if: 

--- Document Chunk 9371 ---
a) no Cold Movement Detection function is implemented in the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 9372 ---
board equipment, OR 

--- Document Chunk 9373 ---
b) the Cold Movement Detection func tion has encountered a condition, during the No 

--- Document Chunk 9374 ---
Power period, which prevents the use of the Cold Movement information (e.g. the 

--- Document Chunk 9375 ---
battery ensuring the Cold Movement Detection function has run down during the No 

--- Document Chunk 9376 ---

3.15.9 Virtual Balise Cover 

--- Document Chunk 9389 ---
3.15.9.1 It shall be possible to set and remove from balise a Virtual Balise Cover (VBC). A VBC 

--- Document Chunk 9390 ---
is defined by: 

--- Document Chunk 9391 ---
a) A marker corresponding to balises to be ignored by the on -board together with the 

--- Document Chunk 9392 ---
area (country or region) in which the VBC is applicable. The VBC marker and the 

--- Document Chunk 9393 ---
country/region identity form the unique VBC identity. 

--- Document Chunk 9394 ---
b) Its validity period. 

--- Document Chunk 9395 ---
3.15.9.2 During a start of mission, the driver shall have the opportunity to set a new VBC, or to 

--- Document Chunk 9396 ---
remove an existing one. 

--- Document Chunk 9397 ---
3.15.9.3 As long as a VBC is stored on-board: 

--- Document Chunk 9398 ---
a) The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall ignore any balise telegram that 

--- Document Chunk 9399 ---
includes a VBC marker  and a country/region identity that both match the VBC 

--- Document Chunk 9400 ---
identity. 

--- Document Chunk 9401 ---
b) No reaction shall be applied if errors in the reading of the rest of such balise 

--- Document Chunk 9402 ---
telegram occur. 

--- Document Chunk 9403 ---
3.15.9.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipmen t receives from balise or from driver a new 

--- Document Chunk 9404 ---
VBC with the same VBC identity as an already stored VBC, the new VBC shall replace 

--- Document Chunk 9405 ---
the previous one, including its validity period. 

--- Document Chunk 9406 ---
3.15.9.5 A VBC shall be retained on-board when the on -board equipment is switched off (i. e. 

--- Document Chunk 9407 ---
enters No Power mode)  and shall remai n applicable when powered on  again. It shall 

--- Document Chunk 9408 ---
be deleted when: 

--- Document Chunk 9409 ---
a) it is ordered by trackside, or 

--- Document Chunk 9410 ---
b) its validity period has elapsed, or 

--- Document Chunk 9411 ---
c) it is removed by the driver (during Start of Mission), or 

--- Document Chunk 9412 ---
d) a mismatch is detected between the country/region identity read from a balise group 

--- Document Chunk 9413 ---
and the country/region identity of the VBC. Not e: this means that the reception of a 

--- Document Chunk 9414 ---
consistent balise group message is a necessary condition for deleting a VBC due to 

--- Document Chunk 9415 ---
mismatching country/region identities. 

--- Document Chunk 9416 ---
3.15.10 Advance display of route related information 

--- Document Chunk 9417 ---
3.15.10.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the possibility to display , only on 

--- Document Chunk 9418 ---
driver request, an overview of the gradient profile (as received from trackside), of the 

--- Document Chunk 9419 ---
MRSP, of the track conditions  (except the tunnel stopping areas) , of the indication 

--- Document Chunk 9420 ---
location at MRSP speed (see 3.13.10.4.11) and of the first target at zero speed, if any 

--- Document Chunk 9421 ---
(e.g. the EOA or the start location of a mode profile) , with the remaining distances 

--- Document Chunk 9422 ---

3.16 Data COnsistency 

--- Document Chunk 9443 ---
3.16.1 Criteria of consistency 

--- Document Chunk 9444 ---
3.16.1.1 The on-board shall not consider a message transmitted from the trackside if any of the 

--- Document Chunk 9445 ---
following criteria is not fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 9446 ---
a) Correctness of the received message: the whole message shall be complete and 

--- Document Chunk 9447 ---
respect the ETCS language; variables shall not have invalid values  

--- Document Chunk 9448 ---
b) The message shall be received in due time. 

--- Document Chunk 9449 ---
c) The message shall be received at the right expected location. 

--- Document Chunk 9450 ---

--- Document Chunk 9453 ---
3.16.2.1 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 9454 ---
3.16.2.1.1 The information that is sent from a balise is called a balise telegram. 

--- Document Chunk 9455 ---
3.16.2.1.2 The whole set of information (balise telegram or telegrams) coming from a ba lise 

--- Document Chunk 9456 ---
group is called a balise group message.  

--- Document Chunk 9457 ---
3.16.2.1.2.1 Note: In case of a balise group containing a single balise, telegram and message 

--- Document Chunk 9458 ---
coincide. 

--- Document Chunk 9459 ---
3.16.2.1.3 A balise within a balise group shall be regarded as missed if  

--- Document Chunk 9460 ---
a) No balise is found within the maximum distance between b alises from the previous 

--- Document Chunk 9461 ---
balise in the group.  

--- Document Chunk 9462 ---

3.16.2.4.6 Instead of a message counter corresponding to a given balise group message, it shall 

--- Document Chunk 9570 ---
be possible to identify a telegram as always fitting all possible messages of the group. 

--- Document Chunk 9571 ---
3.16.2.4.6.1 It shall also be possible to identify a telegram as never fitting any message of the 

--- Document Chunk 9572 ---
group. 

--- Document Chunk 9573 ---
3.16.2.4.7 Comparing message counters of the received telegrams of a balise group message, 

--- Document Chunk 9574 ---
excluding the ones complying with 3.16.2 .4.6, if their values are not al l identical, or at 

--- Document Chunk 9575 ---
least one of  them complies with 3.16.2.4.6.1, this shall be considered as a message 

--- Document Chunk 9576 ---
consistency error. 

--- Document Chunk 9577 ---
3.16.2.4.7.1 In case of single balise group, if the message counter of the received telegram 

--- Document Chunk 9578 ---
complies with 3.16.2.4 .6.1, this shall also be considered as a message consistency 

--- Document Chunk 9579 ---
error. 

--- Document Chunk 9580 ---
3.16.2.4.8 It shall be possible to indicate failures in the system underlying the balise/loop/RIU 

--- Document Chunk 9581 ---
(e.g. the Lineside Electronic Unit, LEU) by sending a balise telegram, a loop message 

--- Document Chunk 9582 ---
or a RIU message including the information "default balise/loop/RIU information". 

--- Document Chunk 9583 ---
3.16.2.4.8.1 If one (and only one) out of a pair of duplicated balise telegrams received by the 

--- Document Chunk 9584 ---
on-board includes the information “default balise information”, the on -board shall 

--- Document Chunk 9585 ---
ignore any other inform ation included in this telegram and shall consider information 

--- Document Chunk 9586 ---
from the telegram not containing “default balise information". 

--- Document Chunk 9587 ---
3.16.2.4.8.2 When duplicated balises are both found and decoded correctly, and both, or 

--- Document Chunk 9588 ---
none of them, contain "default balise information", the  ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9589 ---
equipment shall compose the message using the telegram from the last received 

--- Document Chunk 9590 ---
balise out of the pair. 

--- Document Chunk 9591 ---
3.16.2.4.9 If a message has been received containing the information "default balise information", 

--- Document Chunk 9592 ---
the driver shall be informed. 

--- Document Chunk 9593 ---
3.16.2.5 Unlinked Balise Group Message Consistency 

--- Document Chunk 9594 ---
3.16.2.5.1 An on-board equipment shall reject the message received from a balise group marked 

--- Document Chunk 9595 ---
as unlinked and command application of the service brake in the following cases: 

--- Document Chunk 9596 ---
a) A balise is missed inside the unlinked balise group. 

--- Document Chunk 9597 ---
b) A balise is detected, but no telegram is decoded (e.g. wrong CRC). 

--- Document Chunk 9598 ---
c) Variables in the balise group message have invalid values. 

--- Document Chunk 9599 ---
d) Message counters do not match (see 3.16.2.4.7) 

--- Document Chunk 9600 ---
3.16.2.5.1.1 Exceptions: Concerning a) and b) of clause 3.16.2.5.1, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 9601 ---
board equipment: 

--- Document Chunk 9602 ---
a)  shall not reject the message and shall not command application of the service 

--- Document Chunk 9603 ---

--- Document Chunk 9663 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 9664 ---
a) the on -board antenna leaves the expectation window of the repositioning balise 

--- Document Chunk 9665 ---
group that was announced and already found 

--- Document Chunk 9666 ---
b) a linked balise group that has been announced with known identity is found. 

--- Document Chunk 9667 ---
3.16.2.7.2.2 If a second balise group is found that satisfies the same criteria as the previously 

--- Document Chunk 9668 ---
expected and already found repositioning balise group, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9669 ---
equipment shall command the service brake  and the driver shall b e informed . At 

--- Document Chunk 9670 ---
standstill, the location based information stored on -board shall be shortened to the 

--- Document Chunk 9671 ---
current position. Refer to appendix A.3.4 for the exhaustive list of information, which 

--- Document Chunk 9672 ---
shall be shortened. 

--- Document Chunk 9673 ---
3.16.2.7.2.3 Note: this function is independent from linking function, i.e. the rules related to 

--- Document Chunk 9674 ---
linking always apply. This means that once a repositioning balise group has been 

--- Document Chunk 9675 ---
found and if this latter contains new linking information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 9676 ---
equipment will start expecting the first balise group an nounced in this new linking 

--- Document Chunk 9677 ---
information in parallel with the monitoring specified in 3.16.2.7.2.1.

3.16.3.1 General issues 

--- Document Chunk 9680 ---
3.16.3.1.1 A radio message is consistent when all checks have been completed successfully: 

--- Document Chunk 9681 ---
a) Checks performed by Euroradio protocol have been passed (see Subset-037) 

--- Document Chunk 9682 ---
b) Time stamps checks have been passed (see 3.16.3.3.3) 

--- Document Chunk 9683 ---
c) Variables in the messages do not have in-valid values. 

--- Document Chunk 9684 ---
3.16.3.1.1.1 The on -board shall reject a message transmitted from the trackside if the 

--- Document Chunk 9685 ---
message is not consistent. 

--- Document Chunk 9686 ---
3.16.3.1.1.2 The on-board shall inform the trackside if a not consistent message is received. 

--- Document Chunk 9687 ---
3.16.3.1.2 Emergency messages shall be transmitted either as high priority data or as normal 

--- Document Chunk 9688 ---
priority data. 

--- Document Chunk 9689 ---
3.16.3.1.3 Other messages shall be sent as normal priority data. 

--- Document Chunk 9690 ---
3.16.3.1.3.1 Messages shall only be accepted when received with the  data priority for which 

--- Document Chunk 9691 ---
they are specified. 

--- Document Chunk 9692 ---
3.16.3.1.4 The chapters 3.16.3.2 to 3.16.3.5 define data consistency principles and 

--- Document Chunk 9693 ---
corresponding checks for data transmitted as normal priority data.  

--- Document Chunk 9694 ---
For high priority data, the checks shall not apply. 

--- Document Chunk 9695 ---
3.16.3.2 Time stamping 

--- Document Chunk 9696 ---
3.16.3.2.1 The trackside shall always transmit its information with reference to the train time.

3.16.3.3.3 If the time stamp of the last received message is lower  than or equal to the former one 

--- Document Chunk 9720 ---
its content shall not be used.

--- Document Chunk 9848 ---
SUBSET-104. 

--- Document Chunk 9849 ---
3.17.1.2 The objective of t his section is to define requirements applicable to ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 9850 ---
board equipment and to trackside constituents, when different versions  of the

--- Document Chunk 9855 ---
ERTMS/ETCS system version numbers X included in the envelope of legally operated 

--- Document Chunk 9856 ---
system versions, as defined in chapter 6. 

--- Document Chunk 9857 ---
3.17.2.2 The on-board equipment shall operate with only one syst em version at a time, i.e. it 

--- Document Chunk 9858 ---
shall behave according to the whole set of requirements applicable to a system version 

--- Document Chunk 9859 ---
(refer to chapter 6 in case the operated system version is older than the last one 

--- Document Chunk 9860 ---
introduced in this release of the SRS). 

--- Document Chunk 9861 ---
3.17.2.3 The on -board equ ipment shall determine the operated system version, in relation to

a) if the on -board equipment is in level 0, NTC or 1 (e.g. entrance in level 2/3 area ), 

--- Document Chunk 9897 ---
the RBC system version shall be operated when the transition to level 2/3 is

trackside), the RBC system version shall be operated immediately; 

--- Document Chunk 9901 ---
c) in case of session e stablished with an accepting RBC (RBC/RBC Handover), the 

--- Document Chunk 9902 ---
accepting RBC system version shall be operated as soon as the engine has passed 

--- Document Chunk 9903 ---
the RBC/RBC border location with its maximum safe front end; 

--- Document Chunk 9904 ---
d) in case the on -board equipment switches from level 2/3 to another level (e.g. exit

considered; 

--- Document Chunk 9908 ---
e) in case the engine passes the RBC/RBC border location with its max imum safe

Page 174/200 

--- Document Chunk 10023 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 10024 ---
3.18.2.3 National Values are transmitted with the area(s) (country or region) in which they are 

--- Document Chunk 10025 ---
applicable. They shall become applicable at a defined location, or shall be applicable 

--- Document Chunk 10026 ---
immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 10027 ---
3.18.2.4 Evaluating a balise group message, the balise identity information referring to the 

--- Document Chunk 10028 ---
country or region shall be used to ensure that correct National Values are used. 

--- Document Chunk 10029 ---
3.18.2.5 For each National Value, the corresponding Default Value shall be used as fall back 

--- Document Chunk 10030 ---
value if: 

--- Document Chunk 10031 ---
 the National Value  is not available, or  

--- Document Chunk 10032 ---
 a mismatch has been detected between the country or region identifier read from a 

--- Document Chunk 10033 ---
balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) of the applicable set with which the 

--- Document Chunk 10034 ---
National Value was received and stored. 

--- Document Chunk 10035 ---
3.18.2.6 Note: even th ough the National Values are always transmitted as a single  set for a 

--- Document Chunk 10036 ---
given system version, the content of a set depends on the system version, so that 

--- Document Chunk 10037 ---
when a set of National Values is received or becomes applicable, or when passing a 

--- Document Chunk 10038 ---
balise group, the on -board equipment may apply clause 3.18.2.5 for a subset of 

--- Document Chunk 10039 ---
National Values 

--- Document Chunk 10040 ---
3.18.2.7 The National Values currently applicable when the on-board equipment is switched off 

--- Document Chunk 10041 ---
(i.e. enters No Power mode) shall be retained and shall remain applicable when 

--- Document Chunk 10042 ---
powered on. 

--- Document Chunk 10043 ---
3.18.2.7.1 Justification:  The aim of this requirement is to limit the number of balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 10044 ---
containing National Value information. Once a set of National Values has been 

--- Document Chunk 10045 ---
received on-board, there is no need to re -load the information unless National Values 

--- Document Chunk 10046 ---
change, the on -board equipment loses the information (failure situation), or the train 

--- Document Chunk 10047 ---
enters an area requiring different National Values. 

--- Document Chunk 10048 ---
3.18.2.8 The applicable set of National Values data shall be transmitted from the trackside on 

--- Document Chunk 10049 ---
transition between areas requiring a different set of National Values. 

--- Document Chunk 10050 ---
3.18.2.8.1 When a new set of National Values becomes applicable it s content  shall always 

--- Document Chunk 10051 ---
overwrite the corresponding National Values  currently applicable regardless of the 

--- Document Chunk 10052 ---
country or region identifier(s). 

--- Document Chunk 10053 ---
3.18.2.9 A previously received set of Nationa l Values which is not yet applicable shall be 

--- Document Chunk 10054 ---
deleted if: 

--- Document Chunk 10055 ---
 a new set of National Values is received, or 

--- Document Chunk 10056 ---
 the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is switched off (i.e., enters No Power 

--- Document Chunk 10057 ---
mode). 

--- Document Chunk 10058 ---
3.18.2.10 If a National Value becomes invalid, i.e., a mismatch has been detected b etween the 

--- Document Chunk 10059 ---
country or region identifier read from a balise group and the corresponding identifier(s) 

--- Document Chunk 10060 ---
of the applicable set with which the National Value was received and stored , then it

--- Document Chunk 10626 ---
A.3.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 10627 ---
A.3.4.1.1 All data that can be stored onboard after being accepted may be influenced in special 

--- Document Chunk 10628 ---
situations. 

--- Document Chunk 10629 ---
A.3.4.1.2 The situations acting on the “status” of stored information are: 

--- Document Chunk 10630 ---
a) the execution of a conditional emergency stop (3.10.2.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10631 ---
b) the reception of a shortened MA (3.8.5.1.3, 3.8.5.1.4); 

--- Document Chunk 10632 ---
c) the stored MA is shortened due to a section time-out (3.8.4.2.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10633 ---
d) the SvL is shifted (to the DP if any or to the EOA) due to an overlap time -out 

--- Document Chunk 10634 ---
(3.8.4.4.2) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10635 ---
e) the stored MA is shortened due to an end section time-out (3.8.4.1.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10636 ---
f) a cooperative MA revocation is granted by the onboard (3.8.6.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10637 ---
g) inconsistency in a balise group marked as unlinked and the train is at standstill 

--- Document Chunk 10638 ---
(3.16.2.5.2); 

--- Document Chunk 10639 ---
h) a linking reaction led to a service brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.2.6.2) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10640 ---
i) the re action due to the supervision of the safe radio connection led to a service 

--- Document Chunk 10641 ---
brake and the train is at standstill (3.16.3.4.5 b) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10642 ---
j) the train category, axle load  category, loading gauge or traction system is changed 

--- Document Chunk 10643 ---
and the train is at standstill (3.18.3.7) ; 

--- Document Chunk 10644 ---
k) driver closes the desk during SoM ; 

--- Document Chunk 10645 ---
l) RAMS related supervision functions led to a service brake and the train is at 

--- Document Chunk 10646 ---
standstill (3.16.2.7)

A.3.5 Handling of Actions in Specific Situations 

--- Document Chunk 10869 ---
A.3.5.1 Regards actions executed in reference to location information received from trackside, 

--- Document Chunk 10870 ---
the on -board equipment shall ensure that the action related to a location is neither 

--- Document Chunk 10871 ---
reverted, nor executed twice. Situations to be considered shall include reverse 

--- Document Chunk 10872 ---
movement (initiated by driver or due to roll -away) and the sub -sequent forward 

--- Document Chunk 10873 ---
movement, or adjustment of train position on passing a new LRBG . This rule shall 

--- Document Chunk 10874 ---
apply to the following actions: 

--- Document Chunk 10875 ---
 Change of National Values (see 3.18.2) 

--- Document Chunk 10876 ---
 Request to acknowledge new level, level transition (see SRS chapter 5.10) 

--- Document Chunk 10877 ---
 Start and stop displaying plain or fixed text messages (see 3.12.3) 

--- Document Chunk 10878 ---
 Request to acknowledge a mode profile, mode transition due to mode profile (see 

--- Document Chunk 10879 ---
3.12.4) 

--- Document Chunk 10880 ---
 Start and stop accepting radio infill information (see 3.9.3) 

--- Document Chunk 10881 ---
 Actions related to RBC/RBC handover (see 3.15.1) 

--- Document Chunk 10882 ---
 Actions related to track condition information (see 3.12.1) with the exception of big 

--- Document Chunk 10883 ---
metal masses and non stopping areas 

--- Document Chunk 10884 ---
 Permission to initiate Reversing mode, i.e., limits of Reversing Area (see 3.15.4) 

--- Document Chunk 10885 ---
 Start and stop Track Ahead free request to driver (see 3.15.5)” 

--- Document Chunk 10886 ---
 Start and stop calculation of geographical position (see 3.6.6) 

--- Document Chunk 10887 ---
A.3.5.2 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has received a balise group message 

--- Document Chunk 10888 ---
(i.e. once it has received the last balise telegram of the balise group), the action(s) 

--- Document Chunk 10889 ---
resulting from its content shall take into account the train position measured at the time 

--- Document Chunk 10890 ---
of reception of this last telegram and shall take precedence on any other action related 

--- Document Chunk 10891 ---
to a further location that is reached before the message has been fully processed. 

--- Document Chunk 10892 ---
A.3.5.2.1 Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna, 

--- Document Chunk 10893 ---
before a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the 

--- Document Chunk 10894 ---
EOA/LOA) has been pr ocessed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the 

--- Document Chunk 10895 ---
replacement of the EOA/LOA is considered by the on -board as happening before the 

--- Document Chunk 10896 ---
min safe antenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 

--- Document Chunk 10897 ---
3.13.10.2.7 applies). 

--- Document Chunk 10898 ---
A.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA 

--- Document Chunk 10899 ---
location by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when 

--- Document Chunk 10900 ---
the min safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA) has been processed, will not lead 

--- Document Chunk 10901 ---
to the end of t he override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. In 

--- Document Chunk 10902 ---
other terms, both the deletion of the former EOA and the end of override procedure

happening before the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location. 

--- Document Chunk 10916 ---
A.3.6 Deletion of accepted and stored information when used 

--- Document Chunk 10917 ---
A3.6.1 Standard case 

--- Document Chunk 10918 ---
A3.6.1.1 When the train moves in the direction of its train orientation, storage capacity occupied 

--- Document Chunk 10919 ---
by trackside informa tion no longer used, i.e., the related on -board functionality has 

--- Document Chunk 10920 ---
been completed, shall be made available immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 10921 ---
A3.6.1.1.1 Note: The requirement is needed to allow trackside to predict the storage capacity 

--- Document Chunk 10922 ---
available on -board in order to comply with dimensioning rules regards information 

--- Document Chunk 10923 ---
stored on-board given in Subset 040. 

--- Document Chunk 10924 ---
A3.6.2 Exception 

--- Document Chunk 10925 ---
A3.6.2.1 Following information shall remain stored on -board for a distance defined by a fixed 

--- Document Chunk 10926 ---
value in rear of the min safe rear end position of the train: 

--- Document Chunk 10927 ---
 location dependent static speed restrictions , i.e., SSP, ASP, TSR, LX SR, PBD SR 

--- Document Chunk 10928 ---
(see 3.11.2.2) 

--- Document Chunk 10929 ---
 gradient information, 

--- Document Chunk 10930 ---
 reduced adhesion information received from trackside, 

--- Document Chunk 10931 ---
 Track condition “Big metal masses”. 

--- Document Chunk 10932 ---
A3.6.2.1.1 Note: The above information remains stored for the case of a reverse movement: 

--- Document Chunk 10933 ---
 With the exception of the track condition “Big metal masses”,  the stored 

--- Document Chunk 10934 ---
information allows the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to calculate speed 

--- Document Chunk 10935 ---
supervision limits after a reverse movement (roll-away, or initiated by the driver)  

--- Document Chunk 10936 ---
 Track condition “Big metal masses” is needed also for a reverse movement itself to 

--- Document Chunk 10937 ---
avoid any false alarms due to Big metal masses in the track. 

--- Document Chunk 10938 ---
A3.6.2.1.2 Note: The distance to intervention of the roll away or reverse movement supervision is 

--- Document Chunk 10939 ---
determined by a National/Default value.  This is also true for a reverse movement in 

--- Document Chunk 10940 ---
Post trip mode. However, following an intervention, the train will not stop immediately. 

--- Document Chunk 10941 ---
In order to keep the on -board functionality simple, a fixed distance value was chosen  

--- Document Chunk 10942 ---
to define an unambiguous location in rear of the train where the above information is 

--- Document Chunk 10943 ---
no longer required and the related on-board storage capacity is made available again. 

--- Document Chunk 10944 ---
A.3.7  Calculation of the basic deceleration 

--- Document Chunk 10945 ---
A.3.7.1 The brake percentage (λ) shall be converted into two different input parameters: 

--- Document Chunk 10946 ---
λo = λ for calculation of emergency brake deceleration (A_brake_emergency(V))

λo = MIN (λ, 135) for calculation of service brake deceleration (A_brake_service(V)) 

--- Document Chunk 10959 ---
where λ is the brake percentage defined as part of Train Data. 

--- Document Chunk 10960 ---
A.3.7.2 The calculation of the basic deceleration (A_basic(V)) shall use a common algorithm 

--- Document Chunk 10961 ---
that will be used twice, once for the service brake and once for the emergency brake. 

--- Document Chunk 10962 ---
A.3.7.3 The speed limit for the first step shall be calculated as V_lim = x * λo

--- Document Chunk 10963 ---
y. 

--- Document Chunk 10964 ---
V_lim is the speed limit for the first step in km/h

x = 16.85

y = 0.428 

--- Document Chunk 10967 ---
A.3.7.4 The first step of the basic deceleration shall be calculated as AD_0 = A * λo + B

AD_0 is the basic deceleration in m/s2 for 0 ≤ speed ≤ V_lim.

A = 0.0075

B = 0.076 

--- Document Chunk 10971 ---
A.3.7.5 The following steps of the basic deceleration shall be calculated by means of a set of 

--- Document Chunk 10972 ---
polynomials of the third order with the following format: 

--- Document Chunk 10973 ---
AD_n = a3_n * λo

--- Document Chunk 10974 ---
3 + a2_n * λo

--- Document Chunk 10975 ---
2 + a1_n * λo + a0_n 

--- Document Chunk 10976 ---
and with the following values for n (all speed limits in km/h): 

--- Document Chunk 10977 ---
n = 1   valid for V_lim < speed ≤ 100  if V_lim ≤ 100

A.3.9.3 The basic brake build up time for full service brake for freight trains in G shall be 

--- Document Chunk 11101 ---
calculated as: 

--- Document Chunk 11102 ---
T_brake_basic_sb = a + b * (L/100) + c * (L/100)2 

--- Document Chunk 11103 ---
where 

--- Document Chunk 11104 ---
L = MAX (400m; train length in m) 

--- Document Chunk 11105 ---
If train length ≤ 900m: 

--- Document Chunk 11106 ---
a = 3.00 

--- Document Chunk 11107 ---
b = 2.77 

--- Document Chunk 11108 ---
c = 0.00 

--- Document Chunk 11109 ---
If 900m < train length ≤ 1500m: 

--- Document Chunk 11110 ---
a = 10.50 

--- Document Chunk 11111 ---
b = 0.32 

--- Document Chunk 11112 ---
c = 0.18 

--- Document Chunk 11113 ---
A.3.9.4 The equivalent brake build up time for the service brake shall be computed as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 11114 ---
T_brake_service_cm0 = T_brake_basic_sb when V_target = 0 

--- Document Chunk 11115 ---
T_brake_service_cmt = kto * T_brake_basic_sb when V_target > 0 

--- Document Chunk 11116 ---
A.3.9.5 The correction factor kto shall be defined as in A.3.8.5 

--- Document Chunk 11117 ---
A.3.9.6 The values of a, b, c and kto  used in A.3.9.1, A.3.9.2, A.3.9.3 and A.3.9.4  define 

--- Document Chunk 11118 ---
reference value s for the equivalent brake build up time for the service brake , which 

--- Document Chunk 11119 ---
shall be considered as maximum one s. If justified by the specific brake system of the 

--- Document Chunk 11120 ---
train other values of these coefficients, which lead to shorter value s of the equivalent 

--- Document Chunk 11121 ---
brake build up time for the service brake, may be used. 

--- Document Chunk 11122 ---
A.3.9.7 Note: Although certain trains may perform better, the reference values for the 

--- Document Chunk 11123 ---
equivalent brake build up time for the service brake , as defined here, are the 

--- Document Chunk 11124 ---
appropriate basis for infrastructure planning. 

--- Document Chunk 11125 ---
A.3.10 Service brake feedback 

--- Document Chunk 11126 ---
A.3.10.1 The purpose of service brake feedback is to reduce the distance between the SBI and 

--- Document Chunk 11127 ---
EBI supervision limits and between the SBI and SBD curves. 

--- Document Chunk 11128 ---
A.3.10.2 The on-board shall consider the service brake feedback as available for use if: 

--- Document Chunk 11129 ---
a) The service brake feedback is implemented, AND 

--- Document Chunk 11130 ---
b) The national value does not inhibit its use. 

--- Document Chunk 11131 ---
A.3.10.3 Two different types of feedback from the service brake are specified, main brake pipe 

--- Document Chunk 11132 ---
pressure and brake cylinder p ressure. The algorithms below are made for main brake 

--- Document Chunk 11133 ---
pipe pressure. When brake cylinder pressure is used instead this shall be converted 

--- Document Chunk 11134 ---
into a fictive main brake pressure value in the following way:

A.3.10.4 The value of T_bs1 and T_bs2 shall be calculated according to the following algori thm 

--- Document Chunk 11152 ---

A.3.10.5 Note: If T_bs1 and T_bs2 have been locked to 0s and 2 s, the loc king will remain until 

--- Document Chunk 11260 ---
the target speed monitoring is left, even if the train speed comes below the target 

--- Document Chunk 11261 ---
speed. This avoids “jumping” indications. It also makes it possible to release the 

--- Document Chunk 11262 ---
brakes before a speed reduction, without having the curves moving back again. It 

--- Document Chunk 11263 ---
might though result in emergency brake intervention if the driver releases the brakes 

--- Document Chunk 11264 ---
too early. But since EBI is not moved, this is not a safety issue. To keep 2 s between 

--- Document Chunk 11265 ---
the SBI and EBI enables the service brake to be activated first and thus may avoid 

--- Document Chunk 11266 ---
emergency brake. 

--- Document Chunk 11267 ---
A.3.10.6 Note: If feedback has started but T_bs1 and T_bs2 are not locked, the feedback 

--- Document Chunk 11268 ---
function will remain active until the target point is reached. This avoids “jumping” 

--- Document Chunk 11269 ---
indications in some rare situations.

4.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 11684 ---
4.4.1.1 For each mode the following information is given: 

--- Document Chunk 11685 ---
a) The context of utilisation of the mode and the functions that characterise the mode 

--- Document Chunk 11686 ---
(chapter “Description”).  

--- Document Chunk 11687 ---
b) The E RTMS/ETCS levels in which the mode can be used (chapter “Used in 

--- Document Chunk 11688 ---
levels”). 

--- Document Chunk 11689 ---
c) The related responsibility of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment and of the 

--- Document Chunk 11690 ---
driver, once the equipment is in this mode (chapter “Responsibilities”). 

--- Document Chunk 11691 ---
4.4.1.2 A complete list of transitions to  and from each mode is given in the section 4.6.2 

--- Document Chunk 11692 ---

4.4.3 ISOLATION 

--- Document Chunk 11708 ---
4.4.3.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 11709 ---
4.4.3.1.1 In Isolation mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be physically isolated 

--- Document Chunk 11710 ---
from the brakes  and can be isolated from other on -board equipments/systems 

--- Document Chunk 11711 ---
depending on the specific on-board implementation. 

--- Document Chunk 11712 ---
4.4.3.1.2 There shall be a clear indication to the driver that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 11713 ---
equipment is isolated. 

--- Document Chunk 11714 ---
4.4.3.1.3 To leave Isolation mode, a special operating procedure is needed (no transition from 

--- Document Chunk 11715 ---
Isolation is specified). This procedure shall ensure that the on -board equipment is only 

--- Document Chunk 11716 ---
put back into service when it has been proven that this is safe for operation. 

--- Document Chunk 11717 ---
4.4.3.1.4 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter  4.5 “Modes 

--- Document Chunk 11718 ---
and on-board functions”. 

--- Document Chunk 11719 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 11720 ---
4.4.3.2 Used in levels 

--- Document Chunk 11721 ---
4.4.3.2.1 Used in all levels: Level 0, level 1, level 2, level 3 and level NTC.

--- Document Chunk 11723 ---
4.4.3.3 Responsibilities 

--- Document Chunk 11724 ---
4.4.3.3.1 Isolation of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is performed by the driver under his 

--- Document Chunk 11725 ---
complete responsibility. 

--- Document Chunk 11726 ---
4.4.3.3.2 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is isolated, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 11727 ---
equipment has no more responsibility.

mode, The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment supervises the train movements 

--- Document Chunk 11896 ---
against: 

--- Document Chunk 11897 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the shunting mode speed limit  

--- Document Chunk 11898 ---
b) a list of expected balise  groups (if such list was sent by the trackside equipment). 

--- Document Chunk 11899 ---
The train shall be tripped if a balise group, not contained in the list, is passed 

--- Document Chunk 11900 ---
(When an empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, 

--- Document Chunk 11901 ---
all balise groups can be passed) 

--- Document Chunk 11902 ---
c) “stop if in shunting mode” information. The train is tripped if such information is 

--- Document Chunk 11903 ---
received from balise groups 

--- Document Chunk 11904 ---

--- Document Chunk 11908 ---
4.4.8.1.5 When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage level 

--- Document Chunk 11909 ---
transitions. However, an immediate level transition order or a conditional level 

--- Document Chunk 11910 ---
transition order shall be stored and evaluated only when another mode than Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 11911 ---
or Passive Shunting has been entered  (i.e. when the Shunting movement is 

--- Document Chunk 11912 ---
terminated). 

--- Document Chunk 11913 ---
4.4.8.1.5.1 When receiving a communication session establishment order, the ER TMS/ETCS on-

--- Document Chunk 11914 ---
board in Shunting mode shall not establish the communication session, but shall store 

--- Document Chunk 11915 ---
the RBC ID/phone number. 

--- Document Chunk 11916 ---
4.4.8.1.5.2 When in Shunting mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall not manage RBC -RBC 

--- Document Chunk 11917 ---
hand-over, except for storing the RBC ID/phone number given at the RBC/RBC border.

equipment 

--- Document Chunk 11923 ---
 in level 2 and 3 areas, the on-board shall ask the trackside for an authorisation. The 

--- Document Chunk 11924 ---
switch to shunting is possible only after receiving such authorisation. The trackside 

--- Document Chunk 11925 ---
can send a list of balises, that the train is allowe d to pass while in SH, together with 

--- Document Chunk 11926 ---
the authorisation

4.4.11 STAFF RESPONSIBLE 

--- Document Chunk 12057 ---
4.4.11.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12058 ---
4.4.11.1.1 The Staff Responsible mode allows the driver to move the train under his own 

--- Document Chunk 12059 ---
responsibility in an ERTMS/ETCS equipped area. 

--- Document Chunk 12060 ---
4.4.11.1.2 This mode is used when the system does not know the route. For example: 

--- Document Chunk 12061 ---
a) After the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment starts-up (awakening of the train). 

--- Document Chunk 12062 ---
b) To pass a signal at danger / override an EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 12063 ---
c) After a trackside failure (for example: loss of radio contact). 

--- Document Chunk 12064 ---
4.4.11.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 12065 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the staff responsible mode speed limit  

--- Document Chunk 12066 ---
b) a given distance (regarding its origin location see 4.4.11.1.3.1) . The ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 12067 ---
on-board equipment shall supervise braking curves with a target speed of zero to 

--- Document Chunk 12068 ---
the end of this distance. If the train overpasse s this distance (see next note) the 

--- Document Chunk 12069 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall trip the train 

--- Document Chunk 12070 ---
c) a list of expected balise  groups, if this list has been sent by the RBC. The train 

--- Document Chunk 12071 ---
shall be tripped if over -passing a balise group that is not in the list. (When an 

--- Document Chunk 12072 ---
empty list is sent, no balise group can be passed. When no list is sent, all balise 

--- Document Chunk 12073 ---
groups can be passed) 

--- Document Chunk 12074 ---
d) balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in SR’. This order shall immediately trip the 

--- Document Chunk 12075 ---
train, unless the over -passed balise group is included in a list of expected balises 

--- Document Chunk 12076 ---
as defined in item c) 

--- Document Chunk 12077 ---
e) running in the direction opposite to the train orientation (reverse movement 

--- Document Chunk 12078 ---
protection) 

--- Document Chunk 12079 ---
4.4.11.1.3.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall determine the start location of the SR distance 

--- Document Chunk 12080 ---
as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 12081 ---
a) If the National/Default value determin es the max permitted distance to run in SR 

--- Document Chunk 12082 ---
mode, the starting point of this distance shall refer to the estimated position of the 

--- Document Chunk 12083 ---
train front when SR mode was entered, or, already in Staff Responsible mode, 

--- Document Chunk 12084 ---
when Override was activated. 

--- Document Chunk 12085 ---
b) If the max permitted  distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value 

--- Document Chunk 12086 ---
transmitted by the RBC, or entered by the driver, the start location of the distance 

--- Document Chunk 12087 ---
shall refer to the estimated position of the train front when the distance information 

--- Document Chunk 12088 ---
is received or entered. 

--- Document Chunk 12089 ---
c) If th e max permitted distance to run in SR mode is determined by the value 

--- Document Chunk 12090 ---
transmitted by EUROLOOP, the distance information transmitted by EUROLOOP 

--- Document Chunk 12091 ---
shall be referred to one or more reference balise groups. On -board shall evaluate

--- Document Chunk 12104 ---
In case the LRBG is, due to a change of orientation, in front of the train when the 

--- Document Chunk 12105 ---
distance to run in SR mode is to be determined from the EUROLOOP information, 

--- Document Chunk 12106 ---
the complete distance to run in SR mode shall be determined as the distance 

--- Document Chunk 12107 ---
given by EUROLOOP plus the distance between the estimated train front end and 

--- Document Chunk 12108 ---
the LRBG. 

--- Document Chunk 12109 ---
4.4.11.1.4 Note: Since the gradient is unknown, the supervision of the braking curves in Staff

--- Document Chunk 12111 ---
4.4.11.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall give the possibility to the driver to modify 

--- Document Chunk 12112 ---
the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the given distance. This shall be possible 

--- Document Chunk 12113 ---
only at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 12114 ---
4.4.11.1.5.1 If a train movement is detected while the driver is entering the SR speed/distance 

--- Document Chunk 12115 ---

--- Document Chunk 12118 ---
4.4.11.1.6 In level 2/3, the driver shall have the possibility to request a new distance to run in 

--- Document Chunk 12119 ---
Staff Responsible, by selecting "Start". This triggers an MA request. 

--- Document Chunk 12120 ---
4.4.11.1.6.1 Note: Once the SR distance is covered, the driver may have to go further. 

--- Document Chunk 12121 ---
4.4.11.1.6.2 When entering SR m ode, the value applicable for SR mode speed limit and the 

--- Document Chunk 12122 ---
value applicable for SR distance shall be the corresponding National/Default value s. 

--- Document Chunk 12123 ---
Exception for SR distance: SR mode is authorised by RBC giving an SR distance. 

--- Document Chunk 12124 ---
4.4.11.1.6.3 While in SR mode, the value applic able for the SR mode speed limit shall be, if 

--- Document Chunk 12125 ---
available, the last value entered by the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 12126 ---
4.4.11.1.6.4 While in SR mode, the value applicable for the SR distance shall be, if available, 

--- Document Chunk 12127 ---
the last value received by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 12128 ---
a) the distance to run in SR entered by the driver; 

--- Document Chunk 12129 ---
b) the distance to run in SR given by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 12130 ---
4.4.11.1.6.5 When "Override" is selected, the SR mode speed limit value and the SR distance 

--- Document Chunk 12131 ---
value previously entered by driver or given by trackside, if any, shall be deleted. The

--- Document Chunk 12267 ---
4.4.14.1.3 The train shall only be authorised to move backwards a given distance (national value). 

--- Document Chunk 12268 ---
The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise this natio nal distance for 

--- Document Chunk 12269 ---
reverse movements, and shall command the service brakes if the distance is over -

--- Document Chunk 12270 ---
passed. The driver shall be informed about the reason for the brake application. 

--- Document Chunk 12271 ---
4.4.14.1.3.1 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement 

--- Document Chunk 12272 ---
Protection (as in PT mode, the "normally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 

--- Document Chunk 12273 ---
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in PT 

--- Document Chunk 12274 ---
mode). This implies that the given distance to run backwards in PT is considered as a 

--- Document Chunk 12275 ---
directional data, oriented backwards. 

--- Document Chunk 12276 ---
4.4.14.1.3.2 After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed distance 

--- Document Chunk 12277 ---
allowed for moving backwards in Post Trip mode, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 12278 ---
equipment shall command the service brake for any further movement in the directi on 

--- Document Chunk 12279 ---
opposite to the train orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 12280 ---

4.4.15 NON LEADING 

--- Document Chunk 12321 ---
4.4.15.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12322 ---
4.4.15.1.1 The Non-Leading mode is defined to manage the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 12323 ---
of a slave engine that is NOT electrically coupled to the leading engine (and so, not 

--- Document Chunk 12324 ---
remote controlled) but has its own driver. 

--- Document Chunk 12325 ---
4.4.15.1.1.1 Note: This operating situation is called Tandem. 

--- Document Chunk 12326 ---
4.4.15.1.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall use, as a necessary condition to 

--- Document Chunk 12327 ---
enter in Non-Leading mode, a “non leading input signal" from the train interface. 

--- Document Chunk 12328 ---
4.4.15.1.1.3 If the “non leading input signal" is no longer present, the switch to Stand -By 

--- Document Chunk 12329 ---
mode shall be made only if the train is at standstill. 

--- Document Chunk 12330 ---
4.4.15.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall not perform any train movement 

--- Document Chunk 12331 ---
supervision in Non-Leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 12332 ---
4.4.15.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS  on-board equipment shall perform the Train Position function; in 

--- Document Chunk 12333 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e., not the train) shall be used to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 12334 ---
train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 12335 ---
4.4.15.1.4 When level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall report its po sition to 

--- Document Chunk 12336 ---
the RBC, according to the previously received parameters. 

--- Document Chunk 12337 ---
4.4.15.1.5 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a non -leading 

--- Document Chunk 12338 ---
engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall therefore try to memorise the 

--- Document Chunk 12339 ---
occurrence of such fault(s), which shall be handled when the engine leaves Non 

--- Document Chunk 12340 ---
Leading mode. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also try to send an error 

--- Document Chunk 12341 ---
information to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 12342 ---
4.4.15.1.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the train speed to the driver.

4.4.18 REVERSING 

--- Document Chunk 12428 ---
4.4.18.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12429 ---
4.4.18.1.1 The Reversing mode allows the driver to change the direction of movement of the train 

--- Document Chunk 12430 ---
and drive from the same cab, i.e. the train orientation remains unchanged. This shall 

--- Document Chunk 12431 ---
be possible only in areas so marked by trackside. Reversing areas shall be announced 

--- Document Chunk 12432 ---
in advance by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 12433 ---
4.4.18.1.2 Note: This mode is used to allow the train to esca pe from a dangerous situation and to 

--- Document Chunk 12434 ---
reach as fast as possible a “safer” location. 

--- Document Chunk 12435 ---
4.4.18.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall supervise train movements against: 

--- Document Chunk 12436 ---
a) a ceiling speed: the Reversing mode speed limit given from trackside 

--- Document Chunk 12437 ---
b) a distance to run in the dire ction opposite to the train orientation , given from 

--- Document Chunk 12438 ---
trackside. The emergency brake shall be commanded if overpassing this distance 

--- Document Chunk 12439 ---
4.4.18.1.4 After the release of a brake command initiated due to an overpassed reversing 

--- Document Chunk 12440 ---
distance, and while the reversing distance is s till overpassed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 12441 ---
board equipment shall command the emergency brake for any further movement in the 

--- Document Chunk 12442 ---
direction opposite to the train orientation. 

--- Document Chunk 12443 ---
4.4.18.1.5 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed, the permitted 

--- Document Chunk 12444 ---
speed and the remaining distance to run. 

--- Document Chunk 12445 ---
4.4.18.1.6 In case the SBI supervision limit is exceeded (refer to chapter 3  table 5, triggering 

--- Document Chunk 12446 ---
condition t4), the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall command the emergency 

--- Document Chunk 12447 ---
brake instead of the service brake . For the revocation of the brake  command, refer to 

--- Document Chunk 12448 ---
3.13.10.2.4. 

--- Document Chunk 12449 ---
4.4.18.1.7 The position reports sent when in reversing mode shall refer to the location of the 

--- Document Chunk 12450 ---
driving cab (as before reversing). 

--- Document Chunk 12451 ---
4.4.18.1.8 Note: The ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment performs the Reverse Movement 

--- Document Chunk 12452 ---
Protection (as in RV mode, the "norm ally allowed movement" is backwards, then the 

--- Document Chunk 12453 ---
Reverse Movement Protection avoids the train running in forward direction when in RV 

--- Document Chunk 12454 ---
mode). This implies that the given distance to run in reversing is considered as a 

--- Document Chunk 12455 ---
directional data, oriented backwards. 

--- Document Chunk 12456 ---
4.4.18.1.9 Note: for the list of main functions related to this mode, refer to chapter  4.5 “Modes 

--- Document Chunk 12457 ---

--- Document Chunk 12458 ---
4.4.18.1.10 In case of balise group message consistency error (refer to 3.16.2.4.4 and 3.16.2.5.1), 

--- Document Chunk 12459 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall not command the service brake. 

--- Document Chunk 12460 ---
4.4.18.1.11 In case there is an alarm reporting a malfunction for the onboard balise transmission 

--- Document Chunk 12461 ---
function, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall ignore this alarm.

4.4.19.1 Description 

--- Document Chunk 12494 ---
4.4.19.1.1 The Limited Supervision mode enables the train to be op erated in areas where 

--- Document Chunk 12495 ---
trackside information can be supplied to realise background supervision of the train. 

--- Document Chunk 12496 ---
4.4.19.1.2 Limited supervision can not be selected by the driver, but shall be entered 

--- Document Chunk 12497 ---
automatically when commanded by trackside and all necessary conditions are fulfilled. 

--- Document Chunk 12498 ---
4.4.19.1.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall supervise train movements against a 

--- Document Chunk 12499 ---
dynamic speed profile. 

--- Document Chunk 12500 ---
4.4.19.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall display the train speed  and the release 

--- Document Chunk 12501 ---
speed, if any (this list is not exhaustive – refer to chapter 4 .7 “DMI depending on 

--- Document Chunk 12502 ---
modes”). Upon request by trackside (refer to clauses 4.4.19.1.4.2 to 4.4.19.1.4.6) if the 

--- Document Chunk 12503 ---
generic LS function marker is stored on -board or if the conditions in clause 

--- Document Chunk 12504 ---
4.4.19.1.4.7 are fulfilled, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also display the 

--- Document Chunk 12505 ---
lowest speed amongst: 

--- Document Chunk 12506 ---
a) the lowest MRSP element between the minimum safe front end of the train and the 

--- Document Chunk 12507 ---
EOA/LOA, AND 

--- Document Chunk 12508 ---
b) the target speed at the EOA/LOA 

--- Document Chunk 12509 ---
4.4.19.1.4.1 The speed resulting from 4.4.19.1.4 a) and b) is called the Lowest Supervised 

--- Document Chunk 12510 ---
Speed within the Movement Authority (LSSMA) 

--- Document Chunk 12511 ---
4.4.19.1.4.2 Upon an order to toggle on the LSSMA display, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 12512 ---
equipment shall start a delay timer: 

--- Document Chunk 12513 ---
a) For order received from RBC/RIU: at the value of the time stamp of the message 

--- Document Chunk 12514 ---
including the order. 

--- Document Chunk 12515 ---
b) For order received from balise group: at the time of passage over the first 

--- Document Chunk 12516 ---
encountered balise of the balise group giving the order. 

--- Document Chunk 12517 ---
c) Exception to a) and b): for order that has been stored in the level transition buffer 

--- Document Chunk 12518 ---
(see section 4.8.3): at the time the level transition is performed. 

--- Document Chunk 12519 ---
4.4.19.1.4.3 When the delay timer value becomes greater than the time -out value given by 

--- Document Chunk 12520 ---
trackside, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall display the LSSMA. 

--- Document Chunk 12521 ---
4.4.19.1.4.4 On reception of an order to toggle (on or off) the LSSMA display, a toggle on 

--- Document Chunk 12522 ---
order which has not been executed yet (because the on -board delay timer has not 

--- Document Chunk 12523 ---
reached the delay time-out value) shall be deleted by the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 12524 ---
4.4.19.1.4.5 If the LSSMA display is already toggled on, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 12525 ---

leading engine), being part of a shunting consist. This mode can also be used to c arry 

--- Document Chunk 12597 ---
on a shunting movement with a s ingle engine fitted with one on -board equipment and 

--- Document Chunk 12598 ---
two cabs, when the driver has to change the driving cab. 

--- Document Chunk 12599 ---
4.4.20.1.2 The desk of a Passive Shunting engine must be closed (since there is no driver, no 

--- Document Chunk 12600 ---
information shall be shown). 

--- Document Chunk 12601 ---
4.4.20.1.3 As the engine is coupled to a leading engine, its ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 12602 ---
shall not perform any train movement supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 12603 ---
4.4.20.1.4 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall perform Train Position function;  in 

--- Document Chunk 12604 ---
particular, the front/rear end of the engine (i.e ., not the train) shall be used to refer to 

--- Document Chunk 12605 ---
train front/rear end. 

--- Document Chunk 12606 ---
4.4.20.1.5 It shall only be possible to enter in Passive Shunting mode from the Shunting mode; 

--- Document Chunk 12607 ---
while in Shunting mode, the driver shall have the possibility to enable the function 

--- Document Chunk 12608 ---
“Continue Shunting on desk closure”. 

--- Document Chunk 12609 ---
4.4.20.1.6 When the active desk is closed, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 

--- Document Chunk 12610 ---
Passive Shunting mode  if the function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is active 

--- Document Chunk 12611 ---
and the “passive shunting input signal” is received from the train interfa ce. If the 

--- Document Chunk 12612 ---
function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” is not active or the “passive shunting 

--- Document Chunk 12613 ---
input signal” is not present, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch to 

--- Document Chunk 12614 ---
Stand-By mode instead. 

--- Document Chunk 12615 ---
4.4.20.1.7 The special function “Continue Shunting on desk closure” s hall allow one and only one 

--- Document Chunk 12616 ---
transition from Shunting mode to Passive Shunting mode. The special function shall be 

--- Document Chunk 12617 ---
inactive once the Shunting mode is left. 

--- Document Chunk 12618 ---
4.4.20.1.8 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened  and no “Stop Shunting on desk 

--- Document Chunk 12619 ---
opening” information  previously received from balise group is stored onboard , the 

--- Document Chunk 12620 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 12621 ---
4.4.20.1.9 If a desk of the Passive Shunting engine is opened and “Stop Shunting on desk 

--- Document Chunk 12622 ---
opening” information previously received from balise gr oup is stored onboard, the 

--- Document Chunk 12623 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall switch to Stand By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 12624 ---
4.4.20.1.10 If possible, the train must not be stopped due to a safety critical fault in a Passive 

--- Document Chunk 12625 ---
Shunting engine. The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall therefore try to 

--- Document Chunk 12626 ---
memorise the occurrence of such fault(s), which shall be handled when the engine 

--- Document Chunk 12627 ---
leaves the Passive Shunting mode.

4.5 Modes and on-board functions 

--- Document Chunk 12673 ---
4.5.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 12674 ---
4.5.1.1 The following table specifies in which modes the on -board functions are active or not. 

--- Document Chunk 12675 ---
The functions are described in the “Related SRS §” (second column of the table). 

--- Document Chunk 12676 ---
4.5.1.2 Note: Modes are not the only thing that can influence an onboard function. This is why 

--- Document Chunk 12677 ---
this Table is not enough in itself to understand all the ERTMS/ETCS onboard 

--- Document Chunk 12678 ---
behaviour. It must be understood a s a complement to all other SRS chapters 

--- Document Chunk 12679 ---
(especially §4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10). 

--- Document Chunk 12680 ---
4.5.1.3 Note: for DMI depending on modes, refer to §4.7. 

--- Document Chunk 12681 ---
4.5.2 Active Functions Table 

--- Document Chunk 12682 ---
4.5.2.1 X = functions shall be active 

--- Document Chunk 12683 ---
Empty case = function shall be inactive 

--- Document Chunk 12684 ---

4.6 Transitions between modes 

--- Document Chunk 13171 ---
4.6.1 Symbols 

--- Document Chunk 13172 ---
4.6.1.1 The indication “4>” means: The condition n°4 must be fulfilled to trigger the transition 

--- Document Chunk 13173 ---
4.6.1.2 From the mode located in the column 

--- Document Chunk 13174 ---
4.6.1.3 To the mode that is indicated by the arrow “>”. 

--- Document Chunk 13175 ---
4.6.1.4 Each transition from a given mode receives a priority order (indicated by “ -px-”, x is the 

--- Document Chunk 13176 ---
priority order) to avoid a conflict between the different transitions when they occur at 

--- Document Chunk 13177 ---
the same time (i.e. in the same clock cycle). P1 has a higher priority than P2. 

--- Document Chunk 13178 ---
4.6.1.5 Some transitions have received the same priority order. This has been decided when it 

--- Document Chunk 13179 ---
is obvious that these transitions cannot occur at the same time, and so can never lead 

--- Document Chunk 13180 ---
to a conflicting situation (for example, the RBC cannot give in the same time a MA for 

--- Document Chunk 13181 ---
FS and a MA for OS to a given engine, this is why the transition “from SR to FS” and 

--- Document Chunk 13182 ---
the transition “from SR to OS” have the same priority order). 

--- Document Chunk 13183 ---
4.6.1.6 "16, 17, 18" means "16 or 17 or 18".

4.7 DMI depending on modes 

--- Document Chunk 13783 ---
4.7.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 13784 ---
4.7.1.1 The DMI is an interface  that allows the direct exchange of information between the 

--- Document Chunk 13785 ---
driver and the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment. The indirect exchange of information 

--- Document Chunk 13786 ---
done v ia the train interface (e.g. a driver’s action on the service brake used for the 

--- Document Chunk 13787 ---
service brake feedback, opening/closing the desk) is not part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 13788 ---
4.7.1.2 The device(s) used to select “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment powered/unpowered” 

--- Document Chunk 13789 ---
is (are) not part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 13790 ---
4.7.1.3 The device(s) used to select /indicate “ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment isolated/not 

--- Document Chunk 13791 ---
isolated” is (are) part of the DMI. 

--- Document Chunk 13792 ---
4.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 13793 ---
4.7.1.5 Information (input or output) only relevant for National System and not originated by 

--- Document Chunk 13794 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board is not included in the following section. 

--- Document Chunk 13795 ---
4.7.2 DMI versus Mode Table 

--- Document Chunk 13796 ---
4.7.2.1.1 X = active: For a  DMI output, this means that the output information shall be shown to 

--- Document Chunk 13797 ---
the driver when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 

--- Document Chunk 13798 ---
column. For a DMI input, this means that it shall be possible for the driver to enter this 

--- Document Chunk 13799 ---
information when the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment is in the mode indicated in the 

--- Document Chunk 13800 ---
column). 

--- Document Chunk 13801 ---
4.7.2.1.2 A = available: This means that the input/output shall become active ONLY if another 

--- Document Chunk 13802 ---
condition(s) is (are) fulfilled. This condition(s) are not described here. 

--- Document Chunk 13803 ---
4.7.2.1.3 Grey cells: availability and meaning defined by national system. 

--- Document Chunk 13804 ---
4.7.2.1.4 NA = Not Applicable: This concerns the modes SF and IS in which the DMI inputs and 

--- Document Chunk 13805 ---
outputs cannot be determined.

4.8 Acceptance of received information 

--- Document Chunk 14199 ---
4.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 14200 ---
4.8.1.1 The aim of this chapter is to give an overview o f which information is accepted  or 

--- Document Chunk 14201 ---
rejected depending on the state of the on -board (level, mode) and the nature of the 

--- Document Chunk 14202 ---
received information (transmission medium, type of information: infill or non-infill). 

--- Document Chunk 14203 ---
4.8.1.2 The following sections have to be interpreted by applying the filters as shown in Figure 

--- Document Chunk 14204 ---
3. The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 14205 ---
level and transmission media”, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information 

--- Document Chunk 14206 ---
depending on the modes”. 

--- Document Chunk 14207 ---
4.8.1.3 If a message contains level transition information, any ot her information in that 

--- Document Chunk 14208 ---
message shall be evaluated considering the level transition information. 

--- Document Chunk 14209 ---
4.8.1.3.1 Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a 

--- Document Chunk 14210 ---
conditional level transition order that causes a level transition  shall be evaluated first 

--- Document Chunk 14211 ---
considering the on -board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for 

--- Document Chunk 14212 ---
further location had been received (i.e. conditions [1] , [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied, 

--- Document Chunk 14213 ---
shall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it sha ll be immediately extracted from 

--- Document Chunk 14214 ---
the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level. 

--- Document Chunk 14215 ---
4.8.1.4 Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a 

--- Document Chunk 14216 ---
change of level, is re -checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This 

--- Document Chunk 14217 ---
implies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment – still 

--- Document Chunk 14218 ---
unchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the 

--- Document Chunk 14219 ---
Third Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes 

--- Document Chunk 14220 ---
in which this information is otherwise useless. 

--- Document Chunk 14221 ---
4.8.1.5 If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all 

--- Document Chunk 14222 ---
other non-infill information in that message. 

--- Document Chunk 14223 ---
4.8.1.6 When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re -evaluating a set of 

--- Document Chunk 14224 ---
information released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be 

--- Document Chunk 14225 ---
evaluated prior to any other location related information.

4.8.2 Assumptions 

--- Document Chunk 14347 ---
4.8.2.1 The following tables shall be applied assuming that: 

--- Document Chunk 14348 ---
a) the information complies with the system version checks (see section 3.17.3) and 

--- Document Chunk 14349 ---
with the data consistency checks.(see section 3.16) 

--- Document Chunk 14350 ---
b) the direction for which the information is valid matches the current train orientation, 

--- Document Chunk 14351 ---
or the balise group crossing direction (for SL , PS  and SH engines).(see section 

--- Document Chunk 14352 ---
3.6.3) 

--- Document Chunk 14353 ---
c) In levels 2/3, it is assumed that the “RBC” information which is marked “A” 

--- Document Chunk 14354 ---
(Accepted) comes from the supervi sing RBC (see RBC/RBC handover). If this 

--- Document Chunk 14355 ---
information is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is 

--- Document Chunk 14356 ---
still responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed  

--- Document Chunk 14357 ---
exception1: the information “Acknowledgement of Train Da ta”, “ Trackside 

--- Document Chunk 14358 ---
constituent system version ”, "Initiation of Communication Session" , "Session 

--- Document Chunk 14359 ---
Management" and “Acknowledgement of Session Termination" shall be immediately 

--- Document Chunk 14360 ---
accepted. 

--- Document Chunk 14361 ---
exception2: the information “Co -operative shortening of MA” , “Revocation of  

--- Document Chunk 14362 ---
Emergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected. 

--- Document Chunk 14363 ---
d) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG. 

--- Document Chunk 14364 ---
e) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed 

--- Document Chunk 14365 ---
(see clause 3.14.3.6) 

--- Document Chunk 14366 ---
4.8.2.2 Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be 

--- Document Chunk 14367 ---
decoded, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”  is 

--- Document Chunk 14368 ---
only used by the on -board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the 

--- Document Chunk 14369 ---
balise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly 

--- Document Chunk 14370 ---
read, the information “ Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” , if 

--- Document Chunk 14371 ---
received, shall be ignored by the on -board equipment. Therefore this information need 

--- Document Chunk 14372 ---
not to be referred to in the following tables. 

--- Document Chunk 14373 ---
4.8.2.3 In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region 

--- Document Chunk 14374 ---
identity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any 

--- Document Chunk 14375 ---
further check in relation to this balise te legram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9. 3 b) ). 

--- Document Chunk 14376 ---
Otherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group 

--- Document Chunk 14377 ---
message, shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need 

--- Document Chunk 14378 ---
not to be referred to in the following tables. 

--- Document Chunk 14379 ---
4.8.2.4 Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the 

--- Document Chunk 14380 ---
STM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET -035), what will happen to the data to be used 

--- Document Chunk 14381 ---
by applications outside ERTMS/ETCS  (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an 

--- Document Chunk 14382 ---
external application, processed by a national function…) is outside the scope of this 

--- Document Chunk 14383 ---
specification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 14384 ---

--- Document Chunk 15022 ---
RBC/RBC handover 

--- Document Chunk 15023 ---
4.8.5.1 If an order to switch to level NTC, 1, 2 or 3 at a further location has been received , the 

--- Document Chunk 15024 ---
ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a transition buffer (see 

--- Document Chunk 15025 ---
figure 3, first filter) three sets of information obtained from three filtered messages. 

--- Document Chunk 15026 ---
4.8.5.2 If a RBC transition order has been received and the Handing Over RBC is still the 

--- Document Chunk 15027 ---
supervising one, the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment shall be able to store in a 

--- Document Chunk 15028 ---
transition buffer ( see figure 3, second filter) three sets of information obtained from 

--- Document Chunk 15029 ---
three filtered messages from the Accepting RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 15030 ---
4.8.5.2.1 Note: the term “set of information” refers to the part of a message being stored in the 

--- Document Chunk 15031 ---
transition buffer  (i.e. information which is neithe r accepted nor rejected immediately) 

--- Document Chunk 15032 ---
according to the conditions stated in 4.8.3.1 [1] and [2] (for level transition) or 

--- Document Chunk 15033 ---
according to 4.8.2.1c (for RBC/RBC handover). 

--- Document Chunk 15034 ---
4.8.5.3 In case three sets of information are already stored in the transition buffer, any new set 

--- Document Chunk 15035 ---
to be stored shall replace the oldest one currently stored. 

--- Document Chunk 15036 ---
4.8.5.4 The sets of information stored in the transition buffer shall be deleted: 

--- Document Chunk 15037 ---
a) in case the level transition order is deleted or overwritten by another level transition 

--- Document Chunk 15038 ---
order for a different level, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15039 ---
b) in case the RBC transition order is deleted or overwritten by an order to switch to 

--- Document Chunk 15040 ---
another Accepting RBC, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15041 ---
c) in case the communication session with the RBC that provided the stored 

--- Document Chunk 15042 ---
information is terminated 

--- Document Chunk 15043 ---
4.8.5.5 At the same time the level transition is perfor med or at the same time the Accepting 

--- Document Chunk 15044 ---
RBC becomes the supervising one, the sets of information stored in the transition 

--- Document Chunk 15045 ---
buffer shall be released and re-evaluated in the sequence they have been received. 

--- Document Chunk 15046 ---
4.8.5.6 This sequential re -evaluation of all the released inf ormation shall be a prerequisite to 

--- Document Chunk 15047 ---
any use by the on -board equipment (e.g. it will lead neither to an intermediate change 

--- Document Chunk 15048 ---
of mode nor to a change of information displayed to the driver) and shall obey the 

--- Document Chunk 15049 ---
following principles: 

--- Document Chunk 15050 ---
a) Starting from the informatio n currently used by on -board at the moment the 

--- Document Chunk 15051 ---
level/RBC transition is effective, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15052 ---
determine the new information for train supervision, by performing sequential 

--- Document Chunk 15053 ---
updates from the information released from the transition buffer, if accepted. 

--- Document Chunk 15054 ---
b) For each information update related to a re -evaluated set of information, the same 

--- Document Chunk 15055 ---
rules shall apply as to information update related to new information accepted 

--- Document Chunk 15056 ---
outside a level/RBC transition context.

4.8.3 implies that the accepted Conditional Emergency Stop information may be 

--- Document Chunk 15071 ---
accepted or rejec ted in a further step (see clause 3.10.2.2) depending on the given 

--- Document Chunk 15072 ---
stop location. This decision , based on the comparison between the min safe front end 

--- Document Chunk 15073 ---
position of the train at the time the message was received and the given stop location,  

--- Document Chunk 15074 ---
shall be considered part of the evaluation process as it affects the further re -evaluation 

--- Document Chunk 15075 ---
of information stored in the transition buffer (see clause 3.10.2.4). 

--- Document Chunk 15076 ---
4.8.5.7.1 Note: For the case of the Unconditional Emergency Stop information accepting the 

--- Document Chunk 15077 ---
information according to table  4.8.3 will always lead to the train being tripped (see 

--- Document Chunk 15078 ---
clause 3.10.2.3) when re -evaluation of the transition buffer is completed . Information 

--- Document Chunk 15079 ---
accepted during re-evaluation of information stored in the transition buffer can then be 

--- Document Chunk 15080 ---
affected on transition to TR mode according to conditions in Table 4.10. 

--- Document Chunk 15081 ---
4.8.5.8 Note: The requirement to acknowledge an Emergency Stop information according to 

--- Document Chunk 15082 ---
clause 3.10.1.4, i.e., communicating to the RBC if the information has been accepted 

--- Document Chunk 15083 ---
(Conditional or Unconditional Emergency Stop) or rejected because the train has 

--- Document Chunk 15084 ---
passed the stop location (Conditional Emergency Stop only), applies to the time when 

--- Document Chunk 15085 ---
the information is used, immediately after the sequential update has been completed. 

--- Document Chunk 15086 ---
Regards acknowledging the reception of an emergency stop message, as for any 

--- Document Chunk 15087 ---
other information received from trackside, see clause 3.16.3.5.

--- Document Chunk 15126 ---
a) data is deleted, 

--- Document Chunk 15127 ---
b) data is to be revalidated,

5.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 15714 ---
5.3.1 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 15715 ---
5.3.1.1 This document defines the procedures that are necessary for interoperability with in the 

--- Document Chunk 15716 ---
scope of ERTMS/ETCS. 

--- Document Chunk 15717 ---
5.3.1.2 Each procedure is defined by a set of mandatory requirements and , where convenient, 

--- Document Chunk 15718 ---
is illustrated by a flowchart. 

--- Document Chunk 15719 ---
5.3.1.3 In case the condition(s) in chapter 4 triggering a mode transition is(are) fulfilled, this 

--- Document Chunk 15720 ---
transition shall be executed even if not shown in the chapter 5 procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 15721 ---
5.3.1.3.1 Note: Such a mode transition could lead to exit ing a procedure immediately (e. g. cut 

--- Document Chunk 15722 ---
off power of on-board equipment, isolation of on-board equipment). 

--- Document Chunk 15723 ---
5.3.1.4 National operation rules (outside of ERTMS/ETCS) are also excluded, but may be 

--- Document Chunk 15724 ---
applied by the railways in addition to the procedures as long as interoperability is 

--- Document Chunk 15725 ---
retained. 

--- Document Chunk 15726 ---
5.3.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 15727 ---
5.3.2.1 Procedures 

--- Document Chunk 15728 ---
A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems 

--- Document Chunk 15729 ---
and components) to either i nformation exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or 

--- Document Chunk 15730 ---
events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the 

--- Document Chunk 15731 ---
required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities. 

--- Document Chunk 15732 ---
5.3.2.2 Entities 

--- Document Chunk 15733 ---
The procedures define the required  system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the 

--- Document Chunk 15734 ---
entities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on -board 

--- Document Chunk 15735 ---
equipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 15736 ---
5.3.2.3 States 

--- Document Chunk 15737 ---
States are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set  of available functions 

--- Document Chunk 15738 ---
and a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains 

--- Document Chunk 15739 ---
active as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not 

--- Document Chunk 15740 ---
completely satisfied.  

--- Document Chunk 15741 ---
Note 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 15742 ---
Note 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another 

--- Document Chunk 15743 ---
one. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force 

--- Document Chunk 15744 ---
branching in states.

Transitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is 

--- Document Chunk 15758 ---
triggered by a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the 

--- Document Chunk 15759 ---
same time. When a transition refers to a driver’s selection, it means that the conditio ns 

--- Document Chunk 15760 ---
to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

5.4 Procedure Start of mission 

--- Document Chunk 15773 ---
5.4.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 15774 ---
5.4.1.1 The driver may have to start a mission: 

--- Document Chunk 15775 ---
a) Once the train is awake, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15776 ---
b) Once shunting movements are finished, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15777 ---
c) Once a mission is ended, OR 

--- Document Chunk 15778 ---
d) Once a slave engine becomes a leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 15779 ---
5.4.1.2 The common point of all these situations is that the ERTMS/ETCS on -board is in 

--- Document Chunk 15780 ---
Stand-By mode, but the Start of Mission will be different, since some data may be 

--- Document Chunk 15781 ---
already stored on-board, depending on the previous situation. 

--- Document Chunk 15782 ---
5.4.1.3 Once the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is in Stand-By mode, the start of mission 

--- Document Chunk 15783 ---
is not the only possibility, the engine may be come remote controlled (i.e. the on-board 

--- Document Chunk 15784 ---
switches to Sleeping mode). 

--- Document Chunk 15785 ---
5.4.2 Status of data stored in the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 15786 ---
5.4.2.1 At the beginning of the Start of Mission procedure, the data required may be in one of 

--- Document Chunk 15787 ---
three states:  

--- Document Chunk 15788 ---
a) “valid” (the stored value is known to be correct) 

--- Document Chunk 15789 ---
b) “Invalid” (the stored value may be wrong) 

--- Document Chunk 15790 ---
c) “Unknown” (no stored value available) 

--- Document Chunk 15791 ---
5.4.2.2 This refers to the follo wing data: Driver ID, ERTMS/ETCS level, RBC ID/phone 

--- Document Chunk 15792 ---
number, Train Data, Train Running Number, Train Position (see 3.6.1.3). 

--- Document Chunk 15793 ---
5.4.2.3 Note 1:  The status of data in relation to the previous and the actual mode is described 

--- Document Chunk 15794 ---
in chapter 4, section "What happens to stored information when entering a mode". 

--- Document Chunk 15795 ---
5.4.2.4 Note 2: The change of status of data in course of the procedure is shown in the table 

--- Document Chunk 15796 ---
in section 5.4.3.3. 

--- Document Chunk 15797 ---
5.4.3 Table of requirements for “Start of Mission” procedure 

--- Document Chunk 15798 ---
5.4.3.1 The ID numbers in the table are used for the representation of the procedure in form of

equipment is in Stand -By mode with a desk open and no communication session is 

--- Document Chunk 15815 ---
established or is being established. 

--- Document Chunk 15816 ---
S1 Depending on the status of the Driver-ID, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15817 ---
request the driver to enter the Driver -ID (if the Driver -ID is unknown) or sha ll request

If the status of the Level data is "invalid", the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15837 ---
request the driver to re-validate or re-enter the ERTMS/ETCS level. 

--- Document Chunk 15838 ---
If the entered / re-validated level is 2 or 3, the process shall go to S3 

--- Document Chunk 15839 ---
If the entered / re-validated level is 0, 1 or one of proposed NTC level(s) (see 3.18.4.2

S3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to re -

--- Document Chunk 15855 ---
enter the Radio Network ID. If the driver elects to do so, the on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15856 ---
acquire an alphanumeric list of available and allowed networks, based on a request to 

--- Document Chunk 15857 ---
the Mobile Terminal(s) and: 

--- Document Chunk 15858 ---
 If this list is empty (E3) the process shall go to A29 

--- Document Chunk 15859 ---
 If the driver selects a new Radio Network ID  from the proposed list, the 

--- Document Chunk 15860 ---
registration of the Mobile Terminal(s) to this new Radio Network shall be  

--- Document Chunk 15861 ---
ordered and the status of the RBC -ID/phone number shall be immediately set 

--- Document Chunk 15862 ---
to “unknown”. 

--- Document Chunk 15863 ---
If at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network , the ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 15864 ---
on-board equipment shall offer the following options to the driver  for the RBC -

--- Document Chunk 15865 ---
ID/phone number: 

--- Document Chunk 15866 ---
 Only if the status of the RBC -ID/phone number is “invalid": order the 

--- Document Chunk 15867 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use  the last stored RBC -ID/phone 

--- Document Chunk 15868 ---
number 

--- Document Chunk 15869 ---
 Order the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment to use the EIRENE short 

--- Document Chunk 15870 ---
number (trackside call routing function) 

--- Document Chunk 15871 ---
 Enter the RBC -ID/phone number (if its status is "unknown"), or revalidate/re -

--- Document Chunk 15872 ---
enter it (if its status is “invalid”). 

--- Document Chunk 15873 ---
Once the driver has selected the first or second option or once data is validated ( E5), 

--- Document Chunk 15874 ---
the process shall go to A31 

--- Document Chunk 15875 ---
A29 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver that the Radio Network 

--- Document Chunk 15876 ---
registration has failed 

--- Document Chunk 15877 ---
This condition leads to S10 (the driver has to unlock the situation to continue e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 15878 ---
selection of new level) 

--- Document Chunk 15879 ---
S10 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall offer the possibility to the driver to select 

--- Document Chunk 15880 ---
SH, NL, or to select Train Data Entry. 

--- Document Chunk 15881 ---
 If the driver selects SH ( E12), the process shall continue in the same way as the 

--- Document Chunk 15882 ---
procedure “Shunting initiated by the driver”.  

--- Document Chunk 15883 ---
If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Sh unting (E13), the process shall 

--- Document Chunk 15884 ---
go back to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 15885 ---
 If the driver selects NL ( E10) then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 15886 ---
immediately switch to Non Leading mode (refer to SRS chapter 4, transition 

--- Document Chunk 15887 ---
between modes: transition [46]). The mission starts in NL  mode (if level is 2 or 3, 

--- Document Chunk 15888 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment also reports the change of mode to the 

--- Document Chunk 15889 ---
RBC).   

--- Document Chunk 15890 ---
 If the driver selects Train Data Entry (E11), the process shall go to S12   

--- Document Chunk 15891 ---
 Following E10, E12,  if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board shall 

--- Document Chunk 15892 ---
delete the train position data (new status: “unknown”)

D33 When the position report marked as "invalid" is received by the RBC, this latter shall 

--- Document Chunk 16010 ---
check whether it can validate this position report. 

--- Document Chunk 16011 ---
If the position report can be validated by the RBC, the process shall go to A35 

--- Document Chunk 16012 ---
Otherwise, if the position report was marked "unknown", or the "invalid" position report 

--- Document Chunk 16013 ---
cannot be validated by the RBC, the process shall go to D22 

--- Document Chunk 16014 ---
Note: How the RBC is able to validate the position report  is a national issue, out of 

--- Document Chunk 16015 ---
the scope for this specification 

--- Document Chunk 16016 ---
A35 The RBC shall inform the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment that the reported position 

--- Document Chunk 16017 ---
is valid. 

--- Document Chunk 16018 ---
When this message is received by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment, the status  

--- Document Chunk 16019 ---
of the position shall be set to "valid" 

--- Document Chunk 16020 ---
The process shall go to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 16021 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 16022 ---
D22 If the reported train position is "unknown", or the RBC is not able to confirm a reported 

--- Document Chunk 16023 ---
"invalid" position, the RBC shall nevertheless decide whether it accepts the train or 

--- Document Chunk 16024 ---
not. 

--- Document Chunk 16025 ---
If yes, the process shall go to A23 

--- Document Chunk 16026 ---
If no, the process shall go to A38 

--- Document Chunk 16027 ---
Note: How the RBC assumes responsibility for the train is a national issue, out of the 

--- Document Chunk 16028 ---
scope for this specification 

--- Document Chunk 16029 ---
A23 The RBC shall inform the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment that it accepts the train 

--- Document Chunk 16030 ---
although the on-board has no "valid" position information. 

--- Document Chunk 16031 ---
A24 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is informed that the train is accepted 

--- Document Chunk 16032 ---
without valid position data, it shall delete the train position data (new status: 

--- Document Chunk 16033 ---
“unknown”) 

--- Document Chunk 16034 ---
This condition leads to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 16035 ---
A38 The RBC shall inform the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment that it rejects the train

5.4.5 Degraded Situations 

--- Document Chunk 16443 ---
5.4.5.1 Nominally, accidental loss of an already open session (that can occur at any step) has 

--- Document Chunk 16444 ---
not been taken into account for the design of the SoM flowchart. However, should such 

--- Document Chunk 16445 ---
a fault occur above D11 the nominal procedure applies (refer to D11 in flowchart). On 

--- Document Chunk 16446 ---
the other hand, if it occurs in any step further than D11, the process shall go to S10. 

--- Document Chunk 16447 ---
5.4.5.2 The SoM flowchart described in section 5.4.3 only includes the main paths and does 

--- Document Chunk 16448 ---
not exhaustively cover the various operational situations, which could occur while 

--- Document Chunk 16449 ---
performing the SoM procedure (e.g. when revised instructions are given to the driver or 

--- Document Chunk 16450 ---
when the driver needs to re-enter already captured data). 

--- Document Chunk 16451 ---
5.4.5.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall also offer the driver the following 

--- Document Chunk 16452 ---
possibilities, in addition to the ones that are described in section 5.4.3: 

--- Document Chunk 16453 ---
a) only at S10 and S20 and if valid Train data is available, to select “Override”. If the 

--- Document Chunk 16454 ---
driver chooses to do so, then the process shall go to the procedure “Override” and, 

--- Document Chunk 16455 ---
if the position is still invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train 

--- Document Chunk 16456 ---
position data (new status: “unknown”) 

--- Document Chunk 16457 ---
b) only at S10 and S20, to re-enter the Driver-ID 

--- Document Chunk 16458 ---
c) only at S10 and S20,to re-enter the “Train running number” 

--- Document Chunk 16459 ---
d) only at S20,  to re-enter the Train data . If the driver chooses to do so , then the 

--- Document Chunk 16460 ---
process shall go to S12. 

--- Document Chunk 16461 ---
e) only at S10 and S20, to re -enter the Level. If the dr iver chooses to do so, t hen the 

--- Document Chunk 16462 ---
process shall go to S2 

--- Document Chunk 16463 ---
f) only at S20, to select “Non Leading”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the 

--- Document Chunk 16464 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch to Non Leading mode 

--- Document Chunk 16465 ---
and, if the position is still invalid, the ERTM S/ETCS on-board shall delete the train 

--- Document Chunk 16466 ---
position data (new status: “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 16467 ---
g) only at S20, to select “Shunting”. If the driver chooses to do so, then the process 

--- Document Chunk 16468 ---
shall go to the procedure “Shunting initiated by driver” and, if the position is still 

--- Document Chunk 16469 ---
invalid, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board shall delete the train position data (new status: 

--- Document Chunk 16470 ---
“unknown”). If, in level 2 or 3, the RBC rejects the request for Shunting, the process 

--- Document Chunk 16471 ---
shall go back to S20. 

--- Document Chunk 16472 ---
h) only at S10, if valid Train Data is available, to select “Start”. If th e driver chooses to 

--- Document Chunk 16473 ---
do so: 

--- Document Chunk 16474 ---
 if the level is 0, then the process shall go to S23. 

--- Document Chunk 16475 ---
 if the level is NTC, then the process shall go to S22. 

--- Document Chunk 16476 ---
 if the level is 1, then the process shall go to S24. 

--- Document Chunk 16477 ---
 if the level is 2/3 and a session is open, then the process shall go to S21. 

--- Document Chunk 16478 ---
 if the level is 2/3 and no session is open, then the process shall go to S24.

5.5 Procedure End of Mission 

--- Document Chunk 16507 ---
5.5.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 16508 ---
5.5.1.1 End of mission refers to the situation where the trackside stops to authorise the 

--- Document Chunk 16509 ---
movement of a unit. End of mission is initiated by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 16510 ---
equipment when entering specific modes (see below). 

--- Document Chunk 16511 ---
5.5.2 Entry to Mode Considered as an End of Mission: 

--- Document Chunk 16512 ---
5.5.2.1 Stand-By mode 

--- Document Chunk 16513 ---
5.5.2.1.1 From FS, LS, OS, UN, NL,  SR, PT, RV or SN mode, the entry of the ERT MS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 16514 ---
on-board equipment into the Stand-by mode is considered as an End of Mission 

--- Document Chunk 16515 ---
5.5.2.1.2 Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 

--- Document Chunk 16516 ---
depend on the National System. 

--- Document Chunk 16517 ---
5.5.2.1.3 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the S tand-by mode, from PT 

--- Document Chunk 16518 ---
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an on-going mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16519 ---
5.5.2.2 Sleeping mode 

--- Document Chunk 16520 ---
5.5.2.2.1 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Sleeping mode is 

--- Document Chunk 16521 ---
considered as an End of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16522 ---
5.5.2.2.1.1 Note: The transition to Sleeping mod e is always made from the Stand -By mode 

--- Document Chunk 16523 ---
(refer to chapter 4, transition between modes). If the end of mission has been already 

--- Document Chunk 16524 ---
executed in Stand-by mode no further end of mission is required. 

--- Document Chunk 16525 ---
5.5.2.3 Shunting mode 

--- Document Chunk 16526 ---
5.5.2.3.1 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from FS, 

--- Document Chunk 16527 ---
LS, OS, SR, SN or UN mode, is considered as an End of Mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16528 ---
5.5.2.3.2 The entry of the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment into the Shunting mode, from PT 

--- Document Chunk 16529 ---
mode, is only considered as an End of Mission if there was an on-going mission. 

--- Document Chunk 16530 ---
5.5.2.3.3 Note: While in SN mode (level  NTC), some other conditions to end the mission may 

--- Document Chunk 16531 ---
depend on the National System. 

--- Document Chunk 16532 ---
5.5.3 End of Mission Procedure 

--- Document Chunk 16533 ---
5.5.3.1 The procedure comprises the following steps 

--- Document Chunk 16534 ---
5.5.3.1.1 Step 1 - MA, Track Description Data and Train Data may be deleted (mode 

--- Document Chunk 16535 ---

5.7 Entry in Shunting with Order from Trackside 

--- Document Chunk 16767 ---
5.7.1 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 16768 ---
5.7.1.1 This procedure is used to allow the entry of a train into a shunting area.  

--- Document Chunk 16769 ---
5.7.1.2 Note: The shunting area, pos sibly including a “safety envelope”, can be already 

--- Document Chunk 16770 ---
occupied by shunting units, not controlled by the trackside. It is therefore possible that 

--- Document Chunk 16771 ---
the train shall enter into the shunting area in OS mode. The switch to OS is performed 

--- Document Chunk 16772 ---
according to the relevant procedure.   

--- Document Chunk 16773 ---
5.7.1.3 The order to switch to SH mode shall be given by means of a mode profile, optionally 

--- Document Chunk 16774 ---
with a list of balises  groups, which the train can pass when the ERTMS/ETCS on -

--- Document Chunk 16775 ---
board equipment is in shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 16776 ---
5.7.1.4 The switch to shunting, if the transition to shunting was ordered by trackside, requires 

--- Document Chunk 16777 ---
a driver acknowledgement, according to the specifications below. 

--- Document Chunk 16778 ---
5.7.1.5 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment has switched to Shunting mode, End of 

--- Document Chunk 16779 ---
Mission, according to chapter 5.5.2.3, is performed. 

--- Document Chunk 16780 ---
5.7.2 Shunting is requested for the current location (from modes different from 

--- Document Chunk 16781 ---
Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 16782 ---
5.7.2.1 In a level 1 area, or at the border from a level 0 to a level 1 area, the beginning of the 

--- Document Chunk 16783 ---
shunting area can be the location where a balise gro up is installed. In level 2/3 it is 

--- Document Chunk 16784 ---
possible to send an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment the order to switch to shunting 

--- Document Chunk 16785 ---
at the current location. 

--- Document Chunk 16786 ---
5.7.2.2 Shunting is requested for the current location means that, according to the mode 

--- Document Chunk 16787 ---
profile received the max safe front end of the train is at or in advance of the location for 

--- Document Chunk 16788 ---
which switching to SH mode is requested. 

--- Document Chunk 16789 ---
5.7.2.3 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 

--- Document Chunk 16790 ---
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS cha pter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 16791 ---
transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 16792 ---
5.7.2.4 If the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 16793 ---
Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake command shall be 

--- Document Chunk 16794 ---
triggered. The command shall be released as soon as the driver acknowledges (unless 

--- Document Chunk 16795 ---
the command was triggered also for other reasons). 

--- Document Chunk 16796 ---
5.7.3 Shunting is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 16797 ---
5.7.3.1 An order to switch to SH at a further location can be sent 

--- Document Chunk 16798 ---
a) in a level 1 area by a balise group,

b) in a level 2 or 3 area by the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 16811 ---
5.7.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver, when the following two 

--- Document Chunk 16812 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 16813 ---
a) the distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 

--- Document Chunk 16814 ---
shunting area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile 

--- Document Chunk 16815 ---
b) the speed is lower than the Shunting mode speed limit (National Value, or value 

--- Document Chunk 16816 ---
given in the mode profile) 

--- Document Chunk 16817 ---
5.7.3.3 Once the request for acknowledgement is displayed, it shall not be taken back, even if 

--- Document Chunk 16818 ---
the above conditions are no more fulfilled (e.g., the train accelerates). 

--- Document Chunk 16819 ---
5.7.3.4 Until the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment has switched to SH mode , according to 

--- Document Chunk 16820 ---
the mode profile, the beginning of the shunting area shall be considered either as the 

--- Document Chunk 16821 ---
EOA (keeping the SvL given by the MA) or as both the EOA and SvL (instead of the 

--- Document Chunk 16822 ---
EOA and SvL given by the MA), with no release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 16823 ---
5.7.3.5 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 16824 ---
immediately switch to SH mode (refer to chapter 4, transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 16825 ---
5.7.3.6 If the max safe front end of the train reaches th e beginning of the shunting area 

--- Document Chunk 16826 ---
according the mode profile and the driver has not yet acknowledged, the 

--- Document Chunk 16827 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall switch immediately to SH mode and a 

--- Document Chunk 16828 ---
request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver (refer to SRS chap ter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 16829 ---
transitions between modes). 

--- Document Chunk 16830 ---
5.7.3.7 If, in this case, the driver does not acknowledge within the driver acknowledgement 

--- Document Chunk 16831 ---
time (refer to Appendix A3.1) after the change to SH mode, the service brake 

--- Document Chunk 16832 ---
command shall be triggered. The command shall be released as  soon as the driver 

--- Document Chunk 16833 ---
acknowledges (unless the command was triggered also for other reasons). 

--- Document Chunk 16834 ---
5.7.4 Shunting from Stand By or Post Trip mode 

--- Document Chunk 16835 ---
5.7.4.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 

--- Document Chunk 16836 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can  receive a mode profile giving an Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 16837 ---
area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the 

--- Document Chunk 16838 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the 

--- Document Chunk 16839 ---
driver. 

--- Document Chunk 16840 ---
5.7.4.2 When the driver acknowledges, the ERTMS /ETCS on-board equipment shall perfo rm

5.8 Procedure Override 

--- Document Chunk 16912 ---
5.8.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 16913 ---
5.8.1.1 In specific degraded situations (for example in the case of a failed signal, failed track 

--- Document Chunk 16914 ---
circuit, failed point…), railways allow a train to pass its EOA.  

--- Document Chunk 16915 ---
5.8.1.2 For ERTMS/ETCS, passing an EOA can be required in degraded situations, e.g. 

--- Document Chunk 16916 ---
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped without MA in a location where radio is unavailable 

--- Document Chunk 16917 ---
(e.g. after having received an emergency message, or after a train trip). 

--- Document Chunk 16918 ---
 In level 2/3, if a train is stopped at the border between two adjacent RBCs (e.g. the 

--- Document Chunk 16919 ---
interface between RBCs is unavailable). 

--- Document Chunk 16920 ---
 In level 2/3 , if a train is stopped after having passed the border between two 

--- Document Chunk 16921 ---
adjacent RBCs (e.g. the connection to the Accepting RBC cannot be established). 

--- Document Chunk 16922 ---
 In level 2/3, if the RBC is unable to give a permission to run (e.g. lost connection 

--- Document Chunk 16923 ---
with the interlocking) 

--- Document Chunk 16924 ---
 In level 1, if a signal cannot show a proceed aspect (e.g., signal failure, route 

--- Document Chunk 16925 ---
cannot be set) 

--- Document Chunk 16926 ---
 In level 1, if a train is stopped without MA (e.g. after the MA has been shortened 

--- Document Chunk 16927 ---
due to a time-out). 

--- Document Chunk 16928 ---
5.8.1.3 In level 0 /NTC areas, passing a signal at danger is only a national procedure. The 

--- Document Chunk 16929 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not 

--- Document Chunk 16930 ---
supervise the train movements. 

--- Document Chunk 16931 ---
5.8.1.4 In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1, 2 or 3), locations where the train shall stop are 

--- Document Chunk 16932 ---
supervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment. Receiving an order from the 

--- Document Chunk 16933 ---
signalman to pass the EOA, the driver must then be able to inhibit this supervision. 

--- Document Chunk 16934 ---
5.8.1.4.1 Note: The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside 

--- Document Chunk 16935 ---
personnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures. 

--- Document Chunk 16936 ---
5.8.1.5 If an EOA must be passed between announcement and execution of the level 

--- Document Chunk 16937 ---
transition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System 

--- Document Chunk 16938 ---
(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1, 2, 3), the signalm an gives the order 

--- Document Chunk 16939 ---
to the driver to select “override”. 

--- Document Chunk 16940 ---
5.8.1.6 Note: Passing the EOA by using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the 

--- Document Chunk 16941 ---
train driving. Therefore Staff Responsible mode is entered when the driver selects 

--- Document Chunk 16942 ---
“override”. 

--- Document Chunk 16943 ---
5.8.1.7 In addition the procedure allows to avoid a train trip when passing a balise group:  

--- Document Chunk 16944 ---
a) transmitting "stop in SR mode" 

--- Document Chunk 16945 ---
b) not contained in the list of expected balises in SR mode

5.8.1.8 Further, the Override procedure allows a train in SR mode reaching the end of the SR 

--- Document Chunk 16961 ---
distance to proceed (see also 4.4.11.1.4) 

--- Document Chunk 16962 ---
5.8.2 Selection of “Override” 

--- Document Chunk 16963 ---
5.8.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Override” (i.e. 

--- Document Chunk 16964 ---
the “Override” button becomes available) only when: 

--- Document Chunk 16965 ---
a) The train speed is under or equal to the speed limit for triggering the “override” 

--- Document Chunk 16966 ---
function (national value) AND 

--- Document Chunk 16967 ---
b) The current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Staff 

--- Document Chunk 16968 ---
Responsible, Shunting, Unfitt ed, Post Trip, Stand By (in level 2/3 only)  or S N 

--- Document Chunk 16969 ---
(National System) AND 

--- Document Chunk 16970 ---
c) Validated Train Data is available (except when already in Shunting mode). 

--- Document Chunk 16971 ---
5.8.2.2 Intentionally deleted. 

--- Document Chunk 16972 ---
5.8.2.3 The “Override” procedure shall be triggered when selected by the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 16973 ---
5.8.3 Once the “Override” procedure has been triggered 

--- Document Chunk 16974 ---
5.8.3.1 The mode shall change as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 16975 ---
a) If the current mode is Full Supervision, Limited Supervision, On Sight, Stand -By or 

--- Document Chunk 16976 ---
Post Trip, the mode shall immediately switch to the Staff Responsible (SR) mode (if 

--- Document Chunk 16977 ---
the mode is already SR it remains unchanged) 

--- Document Chunk 16978 ---
b) If the current mode is Shunting the mode shall remain unchanged 

--- Document Chunk 16979 ---
c) If the current mode is Unfitted (level 0 area) or S N (level NTC area) the mode shall 

--- Document Chunk 16980 ---
only change to Staff Responsible when the level changes to 1,2 or 3 (refer to SRS  

--- Document Chunk 16981 ---
chapter 4, transitions between modes) 

--- Document Chunk 16982 ---
5.8.3.1.1 If the mode, when activating Override, is OS , LS  or FS, the former EOA shall be 

--- Document Chunk 16983 ---
retained. If the mode is SB or PT, the current position of the train front shall be 

--- Document Chunk 16984 ---
considered as the former EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 16985 ---
5.8.3.1.2 Note: This former EOA will be used as a Trip condition if the Override function is no 

--- Document Chunk 16986 ---
longer active. Any further activation of the Override in SR mode has no effect on the 

--- Document Chunk 16987 ---
former EOA. 

--- Document Chunk 16988 ---
5.8.3.1.3 The former EOA shall be deleted if: 

--- Document Chunk 16989 ---
a) the train reads the information “stop in SR mode” from a balise group OR

5.8.3.5 In SR mode the driver may modify the value of the SR mode speed limit and of the 

--- Document Chunk 17012 ---
distance to run in SR mode (refer to chapter 4, Staff Responsible mode) 

--- Document Chunk 17013 ---
5.8.3.6  The train trip shall be inhibited (suppression of the transition to the Trip mode), and 

--- Document Chunk 17014 ---
only in level 0, 1, 2, 3, the MRSP shall include the Override function related Speed

5.9 Procedure On-Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17067 ---
5.9.1 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 17068 ---
5.9.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be in On Sight mode before the train 

--- Document Chunk 17069 ---
reaches the beginning of the On Sight area or, at the latest, when the train reaches the 

--- Document Chunk 17070 ---
beginning of the On Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 17071 ---
5.9.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in On Sight mode shall be requested from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17072 ---
The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below. 

--- Document Chunk 17073 ---
5.9.2 On Sight is requested for current location (from modes different from 

--- Document Chunk 17074 ---
Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 17075 ---
5.9.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the On Sight area can be the balise (group) that 

--- Document Chunk 17076 ---
gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and receives this 

--- Document Chunk 17077 ---
information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately switch to On 

--- Document Chunk 17078 ---
Sight mode. 

--- Document Chunk 17079 ---
5.9.2.2 In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 

--- Document Chunk 17080 ---
profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe 

--- Document Chunk 17081 ---
front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall immediately switch 

--- Document Chunk 17082 ---
to On Sight mode. 

--- Document Chunk 17083 ---
5.9.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the On Sight mode. A request of acknowledgement shall 

--- Document Chunk 17084 ---
be displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17085 ---
5.9.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowle dgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 17086 ---
Appendix A3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is 

--- Document Chunk 17087 ---
released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another 

--- Document Chunk 17088 ---
reason(s). 

--- Document Chunk 17089 ---
5.9.2.5 Note: Once in On Sight mode, the speed supervision is such that the train speed 

--- Document Chunk 17090 ---
cannot exceed the OS mode speed limit. If, when entering the On Sight mode, the 

--- Document Chunk 17091 ---
train speed was higher than the OS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was 

--- Document Chunk 17092 ---
allowed in Full Supervision mode, in Limited Supervision mode  or in Staff Responsible 

--- Document Chunk 17093 ---
mode) then a service/emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, 

--- Document Chunk 17094 ---
independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17095 ---
supervision (see Figure 4).

5.9.2.6 Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or Limited 

--- Document Chunk 17127 ---
Supervision mode by giving with the previous MA an EOA (or a LOA = OS mode speed 

--- Document Chunk 17128 ---
limit) at the location  of transition to On Sight mode. In Staff Responsible mode, lateral 

--- Document Chunk 17129 ---
signals (if available) can also order the driver to decrease the train speed. 

--- Document Chunk 17130 ---
5.9.2.7 If the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is already in OS mode when receiving the 

--- Document Chunk 17131 ---
OS mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17132 ---
5.9.3 On Sight is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 17133 ---
5.9.3.1 The beginning of the On Sight area can be a location that the train has not reached 

--- Document Chunk 17134 ---
yet. This occurs when: 

--- Document Chunk 17135 ---
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode Profile w ith an On Sight area that is 

--- Document Chunk 17136 ---
located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 17137 ---
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an On Sight area that is 

--- Document Chunk 17138 ---
located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 17139 ---
5.9.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver when the following 

--- Document Chunk 17140 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 17141 ---
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of On 

--- Document Chunk 17142 ---
Sight area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   

--- Document Chunk 17143 ---
b) The speed is lower than the On Sight mode speed limit (national value, or valu e 

--- Document Chunk 17144 ---
given in the mode profile). 

--- Document Chunk 17145 ---
c) The current mode is not On Sight 

--- Document Chunk 17146 ---
5.9.3.3 Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”.  

--- Document Chunk 17147 ---
5.9.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it is not taken back if the train leaves 

--- Document Chunk 17148 ---
the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

the mode profile may have been received in level 0 (Unfitted mode) or NTC (SN

5.9.6 Exit of On Sight mode 

--- Document Chunk 17222 ---
5.9.6.1 General rule 

--- Document Chunk 17223 ---
5.9.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment exits the On Sight mode when the min safe 

--- Document Chunk 17224 ---
front end of the train passes the end of the On Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 17225 ---
5.9.6.2 First case: The On Sight area ends at the EOA of the current MA 

--- Document Chunk 17226 ---
5.9.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the On Sight area that is given by the Mode Profile has 

--- Document Chunk 17227 ---
the same location as the EOA of the related MA. 

--- Document Chunk 17228 ---
5.9.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authority to be able to exit the On 

--- Document Chunk 17229 ---
Sight area. 

--- Document Chunk 17230 ---
5.9.6.2.3 Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of 

--- Document Chunk 17231 ---
the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, t he RBC has 

--- Document Chunk 17232 ---
nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of 

--- Document Chunk 17233 ---
the On Sight area. This information  

--- Document Chunk 17234 ---
 can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means  (outside 

--- Document Chunk 17235 ---
scope of  ERTMS/ETCS), or 

--- Document Chunk 17236 ---
 can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends 

--- Document Chunk 17237 ---
a “track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 17238 ---
displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the 

--- Document Chunk 17239 ---
current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this 

--- Document Chunk 17240 ---
information to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 17241 ---
5.9.6.2.4 Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to transmit 

--- Document Chunk 17242 ---
an MA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS

5.10 Level Transitions 

--- Document Chunk 17317 ---
5.10.1 General requirements 

--- Document Chunk 17318 ---
5.10.1.1 Every level transition border to levels 2, 3, or NTC shall be announced to the 

--- Document Chunk 17319 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment via balise group or via the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 17320 ---
5.10.1.2 A level transition announcement to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 17321 ---
consist of an order to execute the level transition at a further location corresponding to 

--- Document Chunk 17322 ---
the border. 

--- Document Chunk 17323 ---
5.10.1.3 When the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment receives a level transition 

--- Document Chunk 17324 ---
announcement, and if this announcement will result in a change of the on -board level, 

--- Document Chunk 17325 ---
it shall immediately inform the driver about the announced level transition. 

--- Document Chunk 17326 ---
5.10.1.3.1 Note: In a mixed level area the actual level of the on -board equipment may remain 

--- Document Chunk 17327 ---
unchanged even though a level transition boundary is passed. 

--- Document Chunk 17328 ---
5.10.1.4 At the level transition border a balise group shall be placed with an immediate level 

--- Document Chunk 17329 ---
transition order or a conditional level transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 17330 ---
5.10.1.4.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and level transition orders and conditional 

--- Document Chunk 17331 ---
level transition orders from balises are accepted independent of the level of operation. 

--- Document Chunk 17332 ---

still be executed when the  estimated front end passes the location given in the 

--- Document Chunk 17347 ---
announcement. 

--- Document Chunk 17348 ---
5.10.1.6 The on -board equipment shall manage only one level transition order at a time. 

--- Document Chunk 17349 ---
Therefore a new level transition order shall replace a previously received order, i.e. if a 

--- Document Chunk 17350 ---
new order to switch to a different level or to the same level but at a different location is 

--- Document Chunk 17351 ---
received, before the action from the first order has been performed, only the last order 

--- Document Chunk 17352 ---
shall be executed.

5.10.2.2.1 Note: Level 0 is considered in the same way as the other levels . This means that, for

5.10.2.4.1 The on-board equipment shall consider an ERTMS/ETCS level as “Available for use” 

--- Document Chunk 17411 ---
as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 17412 ---
a) Level 2 or 3: the level is configured on -board and at least one Mobile Terminal is 

--- Document Chunk 17413 ---
available on -board, i.e. the ETCS onboard has detected at least one Mobile 

--- Document Chunk 17414 ---
Terminal in working condition, independently whether it is registered to a network or 

--- Document Chunk 17415 ---
not. 

--- Document Chunk 17416 ---
b) Level NTC: the concerned National System  is available on -board ( if an STM is 

--- Document Chunk 17417 ---
used, refer to SUBSET-035 for further details). 

--- Document Chunk 17418 ---
c) Level 0 or 1: always. 

--- Document Chunk 17419 ---
5.10.2.4.1.1 Note regarding a) and b): how the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment checks the 

--- Document Chunk 17420 ---
availability of the Mobile Terminals or of the National System (in case no STM is used) 

--- Document Chunk 17421 ---
is an implementation issue. 

--- Document Chunk 17422 ---
5.10.2.4.2 Examples: The table of trackside supported levels gives 2, NTC X, 1, NTC Y. If level 1, 

--- Document Chunk 17423 ---
0 and NTC X are “Available for use”, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board will select NTC X 

--- Document Chunk 17424 ---
level. If level 1, 0 and NTC Y are “Available for use”, it will select level 1. If level 2 , 1 

--- Document Chunk 17425 ---
and 0 are “Available for use”, it will select level 2. 

--- Document Chunk 17426 ---
5.10.2.5 When the onboard has selected the level it will switch to, it shall carry out the level 

--- Document Chunk 17427 ---
transition as if it has received a level transition order to this level only i.e. it shall ignore 

--- Document Chunk 17428 ---
the requirements related to transitions to the other levels. 

--- Document Chunk 17429 ---
5.10.2.6 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall inform the driver about the selected level 

--- Document Chunk 17430 ---
transition only. 

--- Document Chunk 17431 ---
5.10.2.7 If none of the ordered level(s) is available for use by the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 17432 ---
equipment, it shall nevertheless make the transition, to the ordered level with the 

--- Document Chunk 17433 ---
lowest priority. 

--- Document Chunk 17434 ---
5.10.2.7.1 Justification: The On -board equipment will then indicate the trackside level to the 

--- Document Chunk 17435 ---
driver to allow him to select the correct procedures for degraded situations. 

--- Document Chunk 17436 ---
5.10.2.8 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall store the table of priority of trackside

5.10.3.14 Conditional level transition order 

--- Document Chunk 17654 ---
5.10.3.14.1 When the ERTMS /ETCS on -board equipment accepts a conditional level transition 

--- Document Chunk 17655 ---
order the onboard shall check whether the current level is contained in the priority list 

--- Document Chunk 17656 ---
of the conditional level transition order. 

--- Document Chunk 17657 ---
5.10.3.14.2 If the current level is contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition order, 

--- Document Chunk 17658 ---
the onboard shall not change the level. 

--- Document Chunk 17659 ---
5.10.3.14.3 If the current level is not contained in the priority list of the conditional level transition 

--- Document Chunk 17660 ---
order, the onboard shall evaluate the conditional level transition order in the sa me way 

--- Document Chunk 17661 ---
as an immediate level transition order (see section 5.10.2). 

--- Document Chunk 17662 ---
5.10.3.14.4 In the same way as for a level transition order, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 17663 ---
shall store the table of ERTMS/ETCS levels supported by trackside. 

--- Document Chunk 17664 ---
5.10.3.14.5 Note: The conditional level transition order allows to check, whether a train operates in 

--- Document Chunk 17665 ---
a permitted level e.g. following a start of mission after a cold movement. The level of a 

--- Document Chunk 17666 ---
train driving in a permitted level will not be changed, regardless of the priority of the 

--- Document Chunk 17667 ---
current level operated by the train.  

--- Document Chunk 17668 ---
5.10.3.15 Transition initiated by driver 

--- Document Chunk 17669 ---
5.10.3.15.1 In addition to the level transitions ordered by trackside, it is also possible, at standstill, 

--- Document Chunk 17670 ---
for the driver to change the ERTMS/ETCS level (refer to section 3.18.4.2). 

--- Document Chunk 17671 ---
5.10.3.15.2 If the driver changes the level to 2 or 3 , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 17672 ---
establish a communication session with the RBC: 

--- Document Chunk 17673 ---
a) immediately if at least one Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network and  a 

--- Document Chunk 17674 ---
valid RBC ID/ phone number is available, OR

--- Document Chunk 17687 ---
for Start of Mission), if either no Mobile Terminal is registered to a Radio Network or 

--- Document Chunk 17688 ---
no valid RBC ID/phone number is available. 

--- Document Chunk 17689 ---
5.10.3.15.2.1 Note regarding b): If the level transition leads to TR mode, the request for RBC 

--- Document Chunk 17690 ---
contact information is only displayed once the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 

--- Document Chunk 17691 ---
PT mode. 

--- Document Chunk 17692 ---
5.10.3.15.3 If the driver changes the level from 2 or 3 to any other, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 17693 ---
equipment shall report the new level to the RBC if a communication session is 

--- Document Chunk 17694 ---
established. When receiving the level change report, the RBC shall order the 

--- Document Chunk 17695 ---
communication session to be terminated. 

--- Document Chunk 17696 ---
5.10.4 Acknowledgement of the level transition 

--- Document Chunk 17697 ---
5.10.4.1 If defined so for the level transition (see table below), the driver shall be requested to 

--- Document Chunk 17698 ---
acknowledge the transition 

--- Document Chunk 17699 ---
a) when the max safe front end of the train has passed a trackside defined location in 

--- Document Chunk 17700 ---
rear of the level transition border 

--- Document Chunk 17701 ---
b) upon receipt of the order to switch to the new level immediately 

--- Document Chunk 17702 ---
5.10.4.1.1 Exception: An ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment in NL mode shall  not require an 

--- Document Chunk 17703 ---
acknowledgement from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 17704 ---
5.10.4.2 If the driver has not yet acknowledged within the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 17705 ---
Appendix A3.1) after the level transition, a service brake command shall be initiated. 

--- Document Chunk 17706 ---
5.10.4.3 The driver shall then acknowledg e the level transition in order to release the service 

--- Document Chunk 17707 ---
brake command. 

--- Document Chunk 17708 ---

5.12 Change of Train Orientation 

--- Document Chunk 18014 ---
5.12.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 18015 ---
5.12.1.1 The scope of this procedure is the supervision of a train where the driver cont rols the 

--- Document Chunk 18016 ---
train from the cab in the front of the train with the direction controller in FORWARD 

--- Document Chunk 18017 ---
position. 

--- Document Chunk 18018 ---
5.12.1.2 This implies that when the driver has to change the orientation of the train, he has to 

--- Document Chunk 18019 ---
change the driving cab. 

--- Document Chunk 18020 ---
5.12.1.3 The scope of this procedure is NOT shun ting movements, during which the driver 

--- Document Chunk 18021 ---
changes the running direction of the train without leaving the cab, by changing the 

--- Document Chunk 18022 ---
position of the direction controller from FORWARD to REVERSE. 

--- Document Chunk 18023 ---
5.12.1.4 The scope of this procedure is NOT the backwards movement that is allo wed in Post 

--- Document Chunk 18024 ---
Trip or in Reversing mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18025 ---
5.12.2 The driver uses the same engine (a mission is on-going) 

--- Document Chunk 18026 ---
5.12.2.1 The situation is the following: The driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the 

--- Document Chunk 18027 ---
leading engine of the train, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine. 

--- Document Chunk 18028 ---
5.12.2.2 Desk A and desk B are connected to the same ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 

--- Document Chunk 18029 ---
5.12.2.3 When the driver closes the desk A, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 18030 ---
immediately go to Stand-By mode, which is considered as an end of mission (see “End 

--- Document Chunk 18031 ---
of Mission” procedure) 

--- Document Chunk 18032 ---
5.12.2.4 When the driver opens the desk B, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 18033 ---
5.12.2.5 When the driver closes a desk and opens the other one of the same engine, the 

--- Document Chunk 18034 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall be able to calculate the new train position 

--- Document Chunk 18035 ---
data (train front position, train orientation), by use of the previous data. 

--- Document Chunk 18036 ---
5.12.3 The driver leaves the engine to go to another one 

--- Document Chunk 18037 ---
5.12.3.1 The described situation is the following : The train has two engines (engine A and 

--- Document Chunk 18038 ---
engine B). The engine A is the leading engine. The eng ine B is a slave engine. Each 

--- Document Chunk 18039 ---
engine has its own ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment.  

--- Document Chunk 18040 ---
a) If engine B is remote controlled, its ETCS on -board equipment is in Sleeping mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18041 ---
Note: The mode is entered when on -board equipment detects the presence of the 

--- Document Chunk 18042 ---
"remote control" signal.

b) If the slave engine is not remote controlled (Tandem operation) by the leading 

--- Document Chunk 18055 ---
engine but  there is a driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18056 ---
is in Non leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18057 ---
c) If the engine B is not remote controlled (Tandem Shunting o peration) by the leading 

--- Document Chunk 18058 ---
engine and there is no driver who controls the engine, then the on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18059 ---
is in Passive Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18060 ---
5.12.3.2 Assumption: The train configuration does not change. 

--- Document Chunk 18061 ---
a) When changing the train orientation, the leading engine A will bec ome the slave 

--- Document Chunk 18062 ---
engine, and the slave engine B will become the leading engine. 

--- Document Chunk 18063 ---
b) If before the change of train orientation engine B was in SL, afterwards engine A will 

--- Document Chunk 18064 ---
be in SL mode; If before the change of train orientation engine B was in NL, 

--- Document Chunk 18065 ---
afterwards engi ne A will be in NL mode ; If before the change of train orientation 

--- Document Chunk 18066 ---
engine B was in PS, afterwards engine A will be in PS mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18067 ---
5.12.3.3 Case "Engine B was in SL mode" 

--- Document Chunk 18068 ---
5.12.3.3.1 The driver of engine A closes the desk, then the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of 

--- Document Chunk 18069 ---
engine A switches to Stand-By mode. If the train has a mission, this is a end of mission 

--- Document Chunk 18070 ---
(see “End of Mission” procedure) 

--- Document Chunk 18071 ---
5.12.3.3.2 As soon as the remote control signal disappears, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 18072 ---
equipment of engine B switches to Stand-By mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18073 ---
5.12.3.3.3 Level 2,3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of engine B shall open a 

--- Document Chunk 18074 ---
communication session (if possible) and report the mode change to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18075 ---
5.12.3.3.4 When the driver opens a desk of engine B he triggers the "Start of Mission" procedure. 

--- Document Chunk 18076 ---
5.12.3.4 Case "Engine B was in NL mode" 

--- Document Chunk 18077 ---
5.12.3.4.1 The driver of engine A selects "Non Leading". The ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches 

--- Document Chunk 18078 ---
to Non Leading mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18079 ---
5.12.3.4.2 Once the non leading input signal is not received any more , the ERTMS/ETCS on-

--- Document Chunk 18080 ---
board equipment of engine B will switch to Stand -By mode ( refer to SRS chapter 4, 

--- Document Chunk 18081 ---
transitions between modes and chapter 5, “End of Mission” procedure). 

--- Document Chunk 18082 ---
5.12.3.4.3 Because the desk is open, when the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment enters Stand-

--- Document Chunk 18083 ---
By mode, the “Start of Mission” procedure is triggered. 

--- Document Chunk 18084 ---
5.12.3.5 Case "Engine B was in PS mode" 

--- Document Chunk 18085 ---
5.12.3.5.1 The driver of engine A selects "Conti nue Shunting on desk closure". The 

--- Document Chunk 18086 ---
ERTMS/ETCS equipment switches to Passive Shunting mode once the driver closes 

--- Document Chunk 18087 ---
the desk of engine A.

Shunting mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18101 ---
5.12.4 The driver uses the same engine (a Shunting movement is on-going) 

--- Document Chunk 18102 ---
5.12.4.1 The situation is the following : while the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is in 

--- Document Chunk 18103 ---
Shunting mode, the driver closes the desk A and leaves the cab A of the Shunting 

--- Document Chunk 18104 ---
engine, to go to cab B and open desk B of this same engine.

5.13 Train Reversing 

--- Document Chunk 18126 ---
5.13.1.1 This procedure is intended to allow the fast reversal of movement of a train, to run 

--- Document Chunk 18127 ---
away from a danger up to a “safe” location. 

--- Document Chunk 18128 ---
5.13.1.2 The area where initiation of reversing will be possible is announced to the 

--- Document Chunk 18129 ---
ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment by trackside (refer to 3.15.4.2 for details).  

--- Document Chunk 18130 ---
5.13.1.3 While the train is at standstill inside the reversing permitted area, the driver shall be 

--- Document Chunk 18131 ---
informed that reversing is possible 

--- Document Chunk 18132 ---
5.13.1.4 If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard detects the driver’s intention to reverse (e.g. from a 

--- Document Chunk 18133 ---
direction controller in reverse position) , the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 18134 ---
ask the driver to acknowledge transition to RV mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18135 ---
5.13.1.5 If the driver acknowledges, the on-board equipment shall switch to RV mode 

--- Document Chunk 18136 ---
5.13.1.6 Once in RV mode,  it shall be possible for the trackside to send a new permitted 

--- Document Chunk 18137 ---
distance to run and a new maximum speed. 

--- Document Chunk 18138 ---
5.13.1.7 Once in RV mode, it shall also be possible for the trackside to send, together with the 

--- Document Chunk 18139 ---
new permitted distance to run and the maximum speed, a new reference location for 

--- Document Chunk 18140 ---
the new permitted distance to run. 

--- Document Chunk 18141 ---
5.13.1.8 Note: this new reference location is the end of a new reversing area given by trackside

5.14 Joining / Splitting 

--- Document Chunk 18156 ---
5.14.1 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 18157 ---
5.14.1.1 Definition for splitting: The “train to be split” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 

--- Document Chunk 18158 ---
split. The “front train after splitting” refers to the front part of the train b efore splitting, 

--- Document Chunk 18159 ---
the “new train after splitting”, refers to the other part. 

--- Document Chunk 18160 ---
5.14.1.2 Definitions for joining: The “train to be joined” is the train at standstill, waiting for being 

--- Document Chunk 18161 ---
joined. The “joining train” is the train performing the joining operation. 

--- Document Chunk 18162 ---
5.14.2 Procedure “Splitting” 

--- Document Chunk 18163 ---
5.14.2.1 Step 1 - The electrical and mechanical links between the two trains must be removed 

--- Document Chunk 18164 ---
(this is a national operational procedure, out of the scope of the SRS). 

--- Document Chunk 18165 ---
5.14.2.1.1 Note: If splitting require s moving the two train parts apart from each other for a sma ll 

--- Document Chunk 18166 ---
distance, this can be done even in SB mode 

--- Document Chunk 18167 ---
5.14.2.2 Step 2a - If the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment which was supervising the train 

--- Document Chunk 18168 ---
before splitting has not performed an end of mission for splitting, the driver must 

--- Document Chunk 18169 ---
modify the Train Data such that it fits with the  new train composition after splitting.  

--- Document Chunk 18170 ---
For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry 

--- Document Chunk 18171 ---
/ Modification Process) 

--- Document Chunk 18172 ---
5.14.2.3 Step 2b - If an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 

--- Document Chunk 18173 ---
in SL mode before,  it will switch to SB mode once the remote control signal is not 

--- Document Chunk 18174 ---
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes).  

--- Document Chunk 18175 ---
For Level 2 or 3: The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall open a communication 

--- Document Chunk 18176 ---
session (if possible) and report the mode change to the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18177 ---
5.14.2.4 Step - 2c If an ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment of the "new train after splitting" was 

--- Document Chunk 18178 ---
in NL mode before, it will switch to SB mode once the non leading input signal is not 

--- Document Chunk 18179 ---
received any more (refer to SRS chapter 4, transitions between m odes and chapter 5, 

--- Document Chunk 18180 ---
“end of mission” procedure).  

--- Document Chunk 18181 ---
5.14.2.5 The driver can then start a new mission with this “new train after splitting” (refer to the 

--- Document Chunk 18182 ---
“Start of Mission” procedure). In all cases, to start a mission is not the only possibility. 

--- Document Chunk 18183 ---
Shunting movements, or not moving the new train at all, are also possible. 

--- Document Chunk 18184 ---
 

--- Document Chunk 18185 ---
5.14.3 Procedure “Joining” 

--- Document Chunk 18186 ---
5.14.3.1 Step 1 – The “joining train” must approach the “train to be joined”. This can be 

--- Document Chunk 18187 ---
performed in SR, OS or SH mode (depending on the information available, and on the 

--- Document Chunk 18188 ---
national procedure for joining).

--- Document Chunk 18201 ---
(vehicle dependent, outside the scope of the ETCS). 

--- Document Chunk 18202 ---
5.14.3.3 Step 3a – If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment remains leading and 

--- Document Chunk 18203 ---
there was no end of mission, the driver must modify the Train Data such that it fits with 

--- Document Chunk 18204 ---
the new train composition. For level 2 or 3, the new train data is sent to the RBC (see 

--- Document Chunk 18205 ---
SRS chapter 3 – Data Entry / Modification Process) 

--- Document Chunk 18206 ---
5.14.3.4 Step 3b – If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 

--- Document Chunk 18207 ---
equipment in SL mode, when closing the desk, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 18208 ---
will switch to SB mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions between modes) and the end of 

--- Document Chunk 18209 ---
mission procedure is executed (see “End of Mission” procedure). T ransition to SL 

--- Document Chunk 18210 ---
mode is from SB mode. 

--- Document Chunk 18211 ---
5.14.3.5 Step 3c: If a former leading ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment is to become slave 

--- Document Chunk 18212 ---
equipment in NL mode, the driver selects NL mode (see SRS chapter 4, transitions 

--- Document Chunk 18213 ---
between modes).  

--- Document Chunk 18214 ---

5.15 RBC/RBC Handover 

--- Document Chunk 18228 ---
5.15.1 Principles 

--- Document Chunk 18229 ---
5.15.1.1 Every RBC/RBC handover shall be announced to the ERTMS/ETCS on -board 

--- Document Chunk 18230 ---
equipment via a balise group or via the RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18231 ---
5.15.1.2 The handover announcement (i.e. RBC transition order) to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board 

--- Document Chunk 18232 ---
equipment shall consist of an order to contact the Accepting RBC (see 3.5.3.5.3) and 

--- Document Chunk 18233 ---
to execute the handover at a further location corresponding to the border. 

--- Document Chunk 18234 ---
5.15.1.2.1 In case of RBC/RBC handover including Radio Network border cross ing, 

--- Document Chunk 18235 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside is responsible for the sequence of orders to register to the 

--- Document Chunk 18236 ---
new Radio Network and to contact the "Accepting" RBC, according to the Radio 

--- Document Chunk 18237 ---
Network’s configuration. 

--- Document Chunk 18238 ---
5.15.1.2.2 Note: In the following sections, "first" Mobile Terminal refers to the one used for 

--- Document Chunk 18239 ---
communication session with “Handing Over” RBC and "second" Mobile Terminal to the 

--- Document Chunk 18240 ---
one used for communication session with “Accepting” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18241 ---
5.15.1.2.3 Note: In the following sections, Radio Networks are supposed to be overlapped. 

--- Document Chunk 18242 ---
5.15.1.3 At the RBC/RBC border  a balise group with an order to execute the handover 

--- Document Chunk 18243 ---
immediately shall be placed. 

--- Document Chunk 18244 ---
5.15.1.3.1 Note: Balise groups are read in all levels and orders from balise groups are accepted 

--- Document Chunk 18245 ---
independent of the level of operation. Also sleeping units read balise groups. 

--- Document Chunk 18246 ---
5.15.1.4 If the m essage from the border balise group is not (yet) received, the handover shall 

--- Document Chunk 18247 ---
still be executed when the train with its max safe front end passes the border location 

--- Document Chunk 18248 ---
according to the announcement information. 

--- Document Chunk 18249 ---
5.15.1.5 The on -board equipment shall manage only one RB C/RBC transition at a time, 

--- Document Chunk 18250 ---
therefore a new transition order shall replace a previously received order. 

--- Document Chunk 18251 ---

--- Document Chunk 18331 ---
the “Accepting” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18332 ---
5.15.2.2.4.2 The “Handing Over” RBC forwards the announcement information to the 

--- Document Chunk 18333 ---
“Accepting” RBC. 

--- Document Chunk 18334 ---
5.15.2.2.4.2.1 Note: Although not required for the case of two communication sessions, the 

--- Document Chunk 18335 ---
forwarding of the announcement information is executed because the “Handing Over” 

--- Document Chunk 18336 ---
RBC has no knowledge if th e ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can handle one or 

--- Document Chunk 18337 ---
two communication sessions.

--- Document Chunk 18469 ---
(instead of the EOA and SvL given by the MA), with no release speed. 

--- Document Chunk 18470 ---
5.16.1.2 The supervision of the LX start location as both the EOA and SvL shall be substituted 

--- Document Chunk 18471 ---
by the inclusion of the LX speed restriction in the MRSP under  conditions depending 

--- Document Chunk 18472 ---
on whether stopping in rear of the LX start location is required or not. The conditions of 

--- Document Chunk 18473 ---
this substitution are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3. 

--- Document Chunk 18474 ---
5.16.1.3 The start location of the LX speed restriction depends on the substitution conditions, 

--- Document Chunk 18475 ---
which are specified in 5.16.2 or 5.16.3 . The end location of the LX speed restriction 

--- Document Chunk 18476 ---
shall be the LX end location.

5.19 Procedure Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 19287 ---
5.19.1 General Requirements 

--- Document Chunk 19288 ---
5.19.1.1 The order to switch to Limited Supervision mode shall be given by means of a mode 

--- Document Chunk 19289 ---
profile. 

--- Document Chunk 19290 ---
5.19.1.2 An acknowledgement for running in Limited Supervision mode shall be requested from 

--- Document Chunk 19291 ---
the driver. The conditions of the acknowledgement are specified below. 

--- Document Chunk 19292 ---
5.19.2 Limited Supervision is requested for current location (from modes 

--- Document Chunk 19293 ---
different from Stand By and Post Trip) 

--- Document Chunk 19294 ---
5.19.2.1 In a level 1 area, the beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be the balise 

--- Document Chunk 19295 ---
(group) that gives the Mode Profile. When the train passes the balise group and 

--- Document Chunk 19296 ---
receives this information, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall immediately 

--- Document Chunk 19297 ---
switch to Limited Supervision mode. 

--- Document Chunk 19298 ---
5.19.2.2 In a level 2 or 3 area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode 

--- Document Chunk 19299 ---
profile giving a Limited Super vision area which the train has already entered with its 

--- Document Chunk 19300 ---
max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall 

--- Document Chunk 19301 ---
immediately switch to Limited Supervision mode. 

--- Document Chunk 19302 ---
5.19.2.3 The driver must acknowledge the Limited Supervision mode. A request of 

--- Document Chunk 19303 ---
acknowledgement shall be displayed to the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 19304 ---
5.19.2.4 If the driver has not acknowledged after the driver acknowledgement time (refer to 

--- Document Chunk 19305 ---
Appendix A3.1), the service brake command shall be triggered. The brake command is 

--- Document Chunk 19306 ---
released when the driver acknowledges, except if brakes are also applied for another 

--- Document Chunk 19307 ---
reason(s). 

--- Document Chunk 19308 ---
5.19.2.5 Note: Once in Limited Supervision mode, the speed supervision is such that the train 

--- Document Chunk 19309 ---
speed cannot exceed the LS mode speed limit. If, when entering the Limited 

--- Document Chunk 19310 ---
Supervision mode, the train speed was higher t han the LS mode speed limit (because 

--- Document Chunk 19311 ---
a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff 

--- Document Chunk 19312 ---
Responsible mode) then an emergency brake  command could be immediately 

--- Document Chunk 19313 ---
triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but be cause of the LS 

--- Document Chunk 19314 ---
supervision (see Figure 22).

--- Document Chunk 19345 ---
5.19.2.6 Note: This sharp brake reaction can be avoided in Full Supervision or On Sight m ode 

--- Document Chunk 19346 ---
by giving with the previous MA an E OA (or a L OA = LS mode speed limit) at the 

--- Document Chunk 19347 ---
location of transition to Limited Supervision mode. 

--- Document Chunk 19348 ---
5.19.2.7 If the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is already in LS mode when receiving the LS 

--- Document Chunk 19349 ---
mode profile, no further acknowledgement shall be requested from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 19350 ---
5.19.3 Limited Supervision is requested for a further location 

--- Document Chunk 19351 ---
5.19.3.1 The beginning of the Limited Supervision area can be a location that the train has not 

--- Document Chunk 19352 ---
reached yet. This occurs when: 

--- Document Chunk 19353 ---
a) In a level 1 area, a balise group gives a Mode  Profile with an Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 19354 ---
area that is located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 19355 ---
b) In a level 2 or 3 area, the RBC gives a Mode Profile with an Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 19356 ---
area that is located at a further location. 

--- Document Chunk 19357 ---
5.19.3.2 A request for acknowledgement shall be displayed t o the driver when the following 

--- Document Chunk 19358 ---
conditions are fulfilled: 

--- Document Chunk 19359 ---
a)  The distance between the estimated front end of the train and the beginning of 

--- Document Chunk 19360 ---
Limited Supervision area is shorter than a value, contained in the mode profile.   

--- Document Chunk 19361 ---
b) The speed is lower than the Limited  Supervision mode speed limit (national value, 

--- Document Chunk 19362 ---
or value given in the mode profile). 

--- Document Chunk 19363 ---
c) The current mode is not Limited Supervision 

--- Document Chunk 19364 ---
5.19.3.3 Note: The first 2 conditions define the “rectangle of acknowledgement”. 

--- Document Chunk 19365 ---
5.19.3.4 Once the acknowledgement request is displayed, it is not  taken back if the train leaves 

--- Document Chunk 19366 ---
the “rectangle of acknowledgement” (for example: because the train accelerates).

5.19.5.1 When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, 

--- Document Chunk 19432 ---
the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an Limited

Supervision area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this 

--- Document Chunk 19434 ---
case, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement 

--- Document Chunk 19435 ---
from the driver. 

--- Document Chunk 19436 ---

5.19.6 Exit of Limited Supervision mode 

--- Document Chunk 19439 ---
5.19.6.1 General rule 

--- Document Chunk 19440 ---
5.19.6.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment exits the Limited Supervision mode when the 

--- Document Chunk 19441 ---
min safe front end of the train passes the end of the Limited supervision area. 

--- Document Chunk 19442 ---
5.19.6.2 First case: The Limited supervision area ends at the EOA of the current MA 

--- Document Chunk 19443 ---
5.19.6.2.1 This occurs when the end of the Limited Supervision area that is given by the Mode 

--- Document Chunk 19444 ---
Profile has the same location as the EOA of the related MA. 

--- Document Chunk 19445 ---
5.19.6.2.2 In this case, the train must receive a new Movement Authori ty to be able to exit the 

--- Document Chunk 19446 ---
Limited Supervision area. 

--- Document Chunk 19447 ---
5.19.6.3 Second case: The Limited Supervision area ends before the EOA of the current 

--- Document Chunk 19448 ---
MA 

--- Document Chunk 19449 ---
5.19.6.3.1 In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the Limited 

--- Document Chunk 19450 ---
Supervision area. 

--- Document Chunk 19451 ---
5.19.6.3.2 When exiting the  Limited Supervision area, the ERTMS/ETCS on -board equipment 

--- Document Chunk 19452 ---
switches either to Full Supervision, On Sight or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS

6.3.1.1 The chapter defines the composition of envelope of legally operated system versions, 

--- Document Chunk 19627 ---
i.e. all the ERTMS/ETCS system versions that trackside shall be allowed to operate 

--- Document Chunk 19628 ---
and that on-board equipment shall support. 

--- Document Chunk 19629 ---
6.3.1.2 By default, all the clauses listed in the other SRS chapters shall be applicable 

--- Document Chunk 19630 ---
regardless of the system version operated; this chapter includes the exceptions to 

--- Document Chunk 19631 ---
these clauses and the additional clauses, which shall apply when the system version of 

--- Document Chunk 19632 ---
some trackside constituents and/or the system version operated relates to a version 

--- Document Chunk 19633 ---
number older than the last one introduced.

6.5 Trackside requirements in relation to older system versions 

--- Document Chunk 19664 ---
6.5.1 Trackside areas operated with system version number X = 1 

--- Document Chunk 19665 ---
6.5.1.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 19666 ---
6.5.1.1.1 The section is applicable for trackside infrastructures that will be tendered and still 

--- Document Chunk 19667 ---
operated with the system version number X = 1, after the entry into force of this 

--- Document Chunk 19668 ---
release of the SRS. 

--- Document Chunk 19669 ---
6.5.1.1.2 Within a trackside infrastructure operated with the system version number X = 1, it 

--- Document Chunk 19670 ---
shall be allowed to use the following values of M_VERSION: 1.0, and 1.1 

--- Document Chunk 19671 ---
6.5.1.1.3 Within a trackside area operated with an RBC certified to the system version number X 

--- Document Chunk 19672 ---
= 1, it shall also be allowed to use the value M_VERSION = 2.0 for balises. 

--- Document Chunk 19673 ---
6.5.1.1.3.1 Note: this configuration is meaningful in case the trains operating on this RBC area 

--- Document Chunk 19674 ---
support the system version number X = 2 and the on-board requirements related to the 

--- Document Chunk 19675 ---
trackside information marked with 2.0 are applicable regardless of the operated 

--- Document Chunk 19676 ---
version (i.e. they are applied by the on-board equipment even if this latter operates 

--- Document Chunk 19677 ---
with the system version number X = 1 ordered by RBC). 

--- Document Chunk 19678 ---
6.5.1.2 Exceptions to chapter 3 

--- Document Chunk 19679 ---
6.5.1.2.1 Clause 3.5.3.11 shall be replaced with:”In case the RBC is the initiator, the first 

--- Document Chunk 19680 ---
message from RBC to on-board shall include a request for acknowledgement and shall 

--- Document Chunk 19681 ---
have the time-stamp and the LRBG identity set to "unknown".” 

--- Document Chunk 19682 ---
6.5.1.2.1.1 Section 3.6.2.4 shall not apply. 

--- Document Chunk 19683 ---
6.5.1.2.2 Clause 3.7.1.1 b) shall be replaced with: “When needed, limitations related to the 

--- Document Chunk 19684 ---
movement authority, i.e. Mode profile for On Sight or Shunting and signalling related 

--- Document Chunk 19685 ---
speed restriction (see sections 3.12.4 and 3.11.6). Mode profile and Signalling related 

--- Document Chunk 19686 ---
Speed restriction shall always be sent together with the MA to which the information 

--- Document Chunk 19687 ---
belongs” 

--- Document Chunk 19688 ---
6.5.1.2.3 In clause 3.7.1.1 c), the bullet “Optionally Speed restriction to ensure a given permitted 

--- Document Chunk 19689 ---
braking distance (see section 3.11. 11)” shall not apply. 

--- Document Chunk 19690 ---
6.5.1.2.4 In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “LX speed restrictions” shall not apply. 

--- Document Chunk 19691 ---
6.5.1.2.5 In clause 3.7.2.4, the bullet “Inhibition of revocable TSRs from balises in L2/3 (from 

--- Document Chunk 19692 ---
RBC only)” shall not apply. 

--- Document Chunk 19693 ---
6.5.1.2.6 Clause 3.9.3.2 shall be replaced with: “The orders shall be sent via balise groups.” 

--- Document Chunk 19694 ---
6.5.1.2.7 Clause 3.9.3.8.1 shall not apply. 

--- Document Chunk 19695 ---
6.5.1.2.8 Clause 3.11.3.2.2 c) shall not apply.

a) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number 

--- Document Chunk 20888 ---
X = 1 

--- Document Chunk 20889 ---
b) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number 

--- Document Chunk 20890 ---
X = 2, but still transmitting some balise/loop/RIU information related to system 

--- Document Chunk 20891 ---
version number X = 1 (see section 6.5.2) 

--- Document Chunk 20892 ---
c) Train is running on a trackside infrastructure operated with system version number 

--- Document Chunk 20893 ---
X = 2, but on-board equipment has established a communication session with a 

--- Document Chunk 20894 ---
neighbouring RBC certified to system version number X = 1 

--- Document Chunk 20895 ---
6.6.2 Specific requirements for on-board operating with system version number

6.6.2.1.1 Clause 3.12.3.4.7.2 shall be replaced with: “If the driver acknowledges before the end 

--- Document Chunk 20899 ---
condition is fulfilled, the on-board equipment shall consider the driver 

--- Document Chunk 20900 ---
acknowledgement as always ending the text display, regardless of the end condition 

--- Document Chunk 20901 ---
defined in 3.12.3.4.3.1”. 

--- Document Chunk 20902 ---
6.6.2.2 Exceptions to chapter 4 

--- Document Chunk 20903 ---
6.6.2.2.1 Clause 4.4.11.1.3 d) shall be replaced with: “balise groups giving the order ‘stop if in

6.6.3.2.2 When a level transition or an RBC/RBC handover is announced, the information stored 

--- Document Chunk 20933 ---
on-board in the transition buffer shall be translated according to system version 

--- Document Chunk 20934 ---
operated on-board at the time the information is released from the transition buffer (i.e.

7.3 Components of ERTMS/ETCS Language 

--- Document Chunk 21689 ---
7.3.1 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 21690 ---
7.3.1.1 The ERTMS/ETCS language is used in transmitting information over the radio, balise 

--- Document Chunk 21691 ---
and loop airgaps. 

--- Document Chunk 21692 ---
7.3.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS language is based on variables, packets, messages and telegrams 

--- Document Chunk 21693 ---
(variables and packets are des cribed in this section, while telegrams and messages 

--- Document Chunk 21694 ---
are described in chapter 8). 

--- Document Chunk 21695 ---
7.3.1.3 Note: A number of variables contain values which have to be assigned. Some of these 

--- Document Chunk 21696 ---
values have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised 

--- Document Chunk 21697 ---
handling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, 

--- Document Chunk 21698 ---
depending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values 

--- Document Chunk 21699 ---
included in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior 

--- Document Chunk 21700 ---
verification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details. 

--- Document Chunk 21701 ---
7.3.2 Definition of Variables 

--- Document Chunk 21702 ---
7.3.2.1 Variables shall be used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in 

--- Document Chunk 21703 ---
minor units. The whole variable has one type (meaning). 

--- Document Chunk 21704 ---
7.3.2.2 Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the 

--- Document Chunk 21705 ---
variable. 

--- Document Chunk 21706 ---
7.3.2.3 Special values have always the highest values in a variable (eg. 11...111 = “unknown”). 

--- Document Chunk 21707 ---
7.3.2.4 Spare values shall be located between the normal and special values in the variable 

--- Document Chunk 21708 ---
range 

--- Document Chunk 21709 ---
7.3.2.5 Names of variables are  unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as 

--- Document Chunk 21710 ---
described in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different 

--- Document Chunk 21711 ---
names. 

--- Document Chunk 21712 ---
7.3.2.6 All variable definitions shall be independent of the transport media over which they are 

--- Document Chunk 21713 ---
used, if used in more than one media. 

--- Document Chunk 21714 ---
7.3.2.7 Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement. 

--- Document Chunk 21715 ---
7.3.2.8 One bit variables (Boolean) shall always use 0 for false and 1 for true. 

--- Document Chunk 21716 ---
7.3.2.9 Offsets for numerical values shall be avoided (0 shall be used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) 

--- Document Chunk 21717 ---
except where justified. 

--- Document Chunk 21718 ---
7.3.2.10 When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall 

--- Document Chunk 21719 ---
be transmitted first. 

--- Document Chunk 21720 ---
7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes:

7.3.3 Definition of Packets 

--- Document Chunk 21744 ---
7.3.3.1 Packets are multiple variables grouped into a single unit, with a defined internal 

--- Document Chunk 21745 ---
structure. 

--- Document Chunk 21746 ---
7.3.3.2 This structure consists of a packet header with: 

--- Document Chunk 21747 ---
 Track to Train: a  unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, the 

--- Document Chunk 21748 ---
orientation information, optionally the distance scale and an information section 

--- Document Chunk 21749 ---
containing a defined set of variables. The packet structure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 21750 ---
Number NID_PACKET Packet identifier 

--- Document Chunk 21751 ---
Direction Q_DIR Specifies the validity  direction 

--- Document Chunk 21752 ---
of transmitted data 

--- Document Chunk 21753 ---
Length L_PACKET  Number of bits in the packet 

--- Document Chunk 21754 ---
Scale Q_SCALE Specifies which distance scale 

--- Document Chunk 21755 ---
is used for all distance 

--- Document Chunk 21756 ---
information within the packet. 

--- Document Chunk 21757 ---
There is no Q_SCALE variable 

--- Document Chunk 21758 ---
in packets which do not contain 

--- Document Chunk 21759 ---
distance information. 

--- Document Chunk 21760 ---
Information ...... Well defined set(s) of variables. 

--- Document Chunk 21761 ---
 Train to Track: a unique packet number, the length of the packet in bits, optionally 

--- Document Chunk 21762 ---
the distance scale and an information section containing a defined set o f variables. 

--- Document Chunk 21763 ---
The packet structure is as follows: 

--- Document Chunk 21764 ---
Number NID_PACKET Packet identifier 

--- Document Chunk 21765 ---
Length L_PACKET  Number of bits in the packet 

--- Document Chunk 21766 ---
Scale Q_SCALE Specifies which distance scale 

--- Document Chunk 21767 ---
is used for all distance 

--- Document Chunk 21768 ---
information within the packet.

7.3.3.3 The packet definition does not change when transmitted over different transmission 

--- Document Chunk 21784 ---
media. 

--- Document Chunk 21785 ---
7.3.3.4 All currently not defined packet identifiers are r eserved for future use  and shall be 

--- Document Chunk 21786 ---
considered as invalid values (i.e. like spare values). Exception: reception of information 

--- Document Chunk 21787 ---
only differing by Y with regards to the highest system version number X supported by 

--- Document Chunk 21788 ---
on-board (refer to section 3.17.3.11). All future packet definitions shall follow the above 

--- Document Chunk 21789 ---
defined structure. 

--- Document Chunk 21790 ---
7.3.3.5 Exception: Packet 0 “Virtual Balise Cover marker” and Packet 255: “End of Telegram” 

--- Document Chunk 21791 ---
do not follow the above defined structure. 

--- Document Chunk 21792 ---
7.3.3.6 N_ITER specifies the number of iterations of a variable or gro up of variables which 

--- Document Chunk 21793 ---
follow. 

--- Document Chunk 21794 ---
7.3.3.7 If N_ITER is 0 then no variables follow. 

--- Document Chunk 21795 ---
7.3.3.8 Two nested levels of iterations can exist. 

--- Document Chunk 21796 ---
7.3.3.9 If, depending on the value of a previous qualifier variable in the packet, a variable is 

--- Document Chunk 21797 ---
optional, it is written indented in the packet definition 

--- Document Chunk 21798 ---
7.3.3.10 Note: Row “Transmitted by” in the description of a packet specifies which 

--- Document Chunk 21799 ---
ERTMS/ETCS trackside device (b alise, loop, RIU, RBC) can  transmit this packet.  

--- Document Chunk 21800 ---
“Any” means that the packet can be transmitted by a balise, a loop, an RBC and a RIU. 

--- Document Chunk 21801 ---

8.3 Introduction 

--- Document Chunk 25802 ---
8.3.1 Scope and Purpose 

--- Document Chunk 25803 ---
8.3.1.1 This chapter defines the format and content of messages necessary for ERTMS/ETCS 

--- Document Chunk 25804 ---
functions. 

--- Document Chunk 25805 ---
8.3.1.2 Concerning the transmission media, this chapter does not cover considerations such 

--- Document Chunk 25806 ---
as medium-specific use constraints (e .g. distance between track -circuit and balise…), 

--- Document Chunk 25807 ---
as well as functions (e .g. detection of balise reference, tim e and location stamp, 

--- Document Chunk 25808 ---
identifying type of receiving balise, Key Management, Releasing/maintaining a radio 

--- Document Chunk 25809 ---
connection…) and performance of the transmission media. 

--- Document Chunk 25810 ---
8.3.2 Definitions 

--- Document Chunk 25811 ---
8.3.2.1 Transmission media considered hereafter are standard ERTMS/ETCS transmission 

--- Document Chunk 25812 ---
media used for ETCS (Eurobalise, Euroradio and Euroloop). 

--- Document Chunk 25813 ---
8.3.2.2 A message includes user data (application level) and protocol data (depending on the 

--- Document Chunk 25814 ---
transmission medium). 

--- Document Chunk 25815 ---
8.3.2.3 A Eurobalise message is the information sent by a balise group (i.e. the message is 

--- Document Chunk 25816 ---
composed of one or several telegrams, sorted by balise number in the group (telegram 

--- Document Chunk 25817 ---
from balise number 1 first), ea ch telegram is transmitted by a Eurobalise). A 

--- Document Chunk 25818 ---
Eurobalise telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of 

--- Document Chunk 25819 ---
Packets.

8.4 Rules 

--- Document Chunk 25866 ---
8.4.1 Common Rules 

--- Document Chunk 25867 ---
8.4.1.1 A message (Euroradio/Euroloop) or telegram (Eurobalise) shall be composed of 

--- Document Chunk 25868 ---
1. One Header, 

--- Document Chunk 25869 ---
2. When needed, a predefined set of variables (only for Radio), 

--- Document Chunk 25870 ---
3. When needed, a predefined set of Packets (only for Radio), 

--- Document Chunk 25871 ---
4. Optional Packets as needed by application. 

--- Document Chunk 25872 ---
8.4.1.2 The transmission order shall respect the order of data elements listed in the message 

--- Document Chunk 25873 ---
format (from top to bottom). 

--- Document Chunk 25874 ---
8.4.1.3 The behaviour of the receiver shall not depend on the sequence of the Packets given 

--- Document Chunk 25875 ---
by the message. 

--- Document Chunk 25876 ---
8.4.1.3.1 Exception for Infill information: The locations given in the packets following packet 136 

--- Document Chunk 25877 ---
(Infill Location Reference) shall be referred to the balise group indicated in such 

--- Document Chunk 25878 ---
packet. 

--- Document Chunk 25879 ---
8.4.1.3.2 Note: orientations are in any case always referred to the directionality of  balise group 

--- Document Chunk 25880 ---
(balise transmission), directionality of loop (Euroloop transmission) or directionality of 

--- Document Chunk 25881 ---
LRBG (radio transmission). 

--- Document Chunk 25882 ---
8.4.1.4 It shall be forbidden to send more instances of the same packet type for the same 

--- Document Chunk 25883 ---
direction in the same message. 

--- Document Chunk 25884 ---
8.4.1.4.1 Exception 1: A message can contain several packets 44 (Data used by applications 

--- Document Chunk 25885 ---
outside the ERTMS/ETCS system). 

--- Document Chunk 25886 ---
8.4.1.4.2 Exception 2: A message can contain several packets 65 (Temporary Speed 

--- Document Chunk 25887 ---
Restriction). In case of  revocable TSRs, the identities of the corresponding tempor ary 

--- Document Chunk 25888 ---
speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) transmitted in the same message shall be 

--- Document Chunk 25889 ---
different. 

--- Document Chunk 25890 ---
8.4.1.4.3 Exception 3: A message can contain several packets 66 (TSR Revocation). The 

--- Document Chunk 25891 ---
identities of the corresponding temporary speed restrictions (variable NID_TSR) 

--- Document Chunk 25892 ---
transmitted in the same message shall be different. 

--- Document Chunk 25893 ---
8.4.1.4.4 Exception 4: A message transmitted by a balise group can contain one packet 136 per 

--- Document Chunk 25894 ---
balise telegram per direction. Each packet 136 indicates which part of that telegram is 

--- Document Chunk 25895 ---
to be considered as part of the infill  information. Multiple packets 136 in balises of a 

--- Document Chunk 25896 ---
balise group shall have identical content per direction.
