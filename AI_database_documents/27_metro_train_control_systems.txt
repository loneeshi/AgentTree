Metro train control  

--- Document Chunk 5 ---
systems

--- Document Chunk 6 ---
In this month’s back to basics 

--- Document Chunk 7 ---
article, three of the team behind 

--- Document Chunk 8 ---
the new IRSE textbook, Metro 

--- Document Chunk 9 ---
Train Control Systems, introduce 

--- Document Chunk 10 ---
the underpinning principles that 

--- Document Chunk 11 ---
make train control for metro 

--- Document Chunk 12 ---
railways different to other types 

--- Document Chunk 13 ---
of railways. The article looks at 

--- Document Chunk 14 ---
some of the unique challenges that 

--- Document Chunk 15 ---
engineers working on this type of 

--- Document Chunk 16 ---
network face and identifies some 

--- Document Chunk 17 ---
of the solutions that tend to be 

--- Document Chunk 18 ---
used when current systems are 

--- Document Chunk 19 ---
installed or upgraded.

--- Document Chunk 20 ---
What is a metro?

--- Document Chunk 21 ---
Let’s start by considering what a metro 

--- Document Chunk 22 ---
is. Metro railways are also referred to 

--- Document Chunk 23 ---
by the generic term ‘mass transit’ and 

--- Document Chunk 24 ---
by more local terms such as ‘Tube’ 

--- Document Chunk 25 ---
or ‘Subway’. There are often major 

--- Document Chunk 26 ---
differences between systems in different 

--- Document Chunk 27 ---
parts of the world, but also a set of 

--- Document Chunk 28 ---
common challenges and approaches. 

--- Document Chunk 29 ---
The textbook explains:

--- Document Chunk 30 ---
“Metros differ from other railways in 

--- Document Chunk 31 ---
that they carry passengers only and 

--- Document Chunk 32 ---
run a more intense train service. They 

--- Document Chunk 33 ---
are concentrated in the world’s cities, 

--- Document Chunk 34 ---
providing travel both above and below 

--- Document Chunk 35 ---
ground for the people who live and 

--- Document Chunk 36 ---
work in them, as well as those who 

--- Document Chunk 37 ---
visit and commute to them. They 

--- Document Chunk 38 ---
range in size from a few kilometres in 

--- Document Chunk 39 ---
length, to those such as Tokyo, Beijing 

--- Document Chunk 40 ---
or New York that are measured in 

--- Document Chunk 41 ---
hundreds of route-kilometres. They 

--- Document Chunk 42 ---
move millions of people over relatively 

--- Document Chunk 43 ---
short distances, sometimes for twenty-

--- Document Chunk 44 ---
four hours per day.

--- Document Chunk 45 ---
“To do that successfully, the metro 

--- Document Chunk 46 ---
service needs to be reliable and resilient. 

--- Document Chunk 47 ---
Rail operations need to be organised, 

--- Document Chunk 48 ---
structured and integrated with other 

--- Document Chunk 49 ---
transport modes. Densely populated 

--- Document Chunk 50 ---
cities cannot function efficiently 

--- Document Chunk 51 ---
unless all modes of transport are 

--- Document Chunk 52 ---
carefully co-ordinated.”

--- Document Chunk 53 ---
What does that mean for the 

--- Document Chunk 54 ---
train control system?

--- Document Chunk 55 ---
On the face of it, metro signalling sounds 

--- Document Chunk 56 ---
simple compared to complex main line 

--- Document Chunk 57 ---
areas. The trains tend to move relatively 

--- Document Chunk 58 ---
slowly, perhaps up to 80 or 100km/h, 

--- Document Chunk 59 ---
they accelerate and brake quickly, and 

--- Document Chunk 60 ---
they tend to be of the same type and 

--- Document Chunk 61 ---
configuration (but not always!). That 

--- Document Chunk 62 ---
means they have the same, or at least 

--- Document Chunk 63 ---
very similar, characteristics in terms of 

--- Document Chunk 64 ---
acceleration, braking and top speed, the 

--- Document Chunk 65 ---
variables that most significantly influence 

--- Document Chunk 66 ---
design. There are no slow-moving 

--- Document Chunk 67 ---
freight trains to worry about, the railway 

--- Document Chunk 68 ---
Metros can be very varied in the way they look, the way they operate and the solutions adopted.

--- Document Chunk 73 ---
is nearly always operated as a fully 

--- Document Chunk 74 ---
vertically integrated business, there are 

--- Document Chunk 75 ---
few points, crossings and complicated 

--- Document Chunk 76 ---
junctions and there tend not to be 

--- Document Chunk 77 ---
connections to neighbouring railways.

--- Document Chunk 78 ---
However, a metro train will typically 

--- Document Chunk 79 ---
carry several hundred people, often 

--- Document Chunk 80 ---
up to 1000, crushed together in peak 

--- Document Chunk 81 ---
periods, at headways as low as 90s with 

--- Document Chunk 82 ---
dwell times of 45s at busy interchange 

--- Document Chunk 83 ---
stations through constrained 

--- Document Chunk 84 ---
infrastructure and crowded stations. 

--- Document Chunk 85 ---
Many lines will be moving between 

--- Document Chunk 86 ---
20 000 and 50 000 people per hour 

--- Document Chunk 87 ---
per direction. Managing that many 

--- Document Chunk 88 ---
people, often in confined spaces, poses 

--- Document Chunk 89 ---
particular challenges, some of which we 

--- Document Chunk 90 ---
will discuss in this article.

--- Document Chunk 91 ---
It's true that the physics of trains are 

--- Document Chunk 92 ---
the same whether you’re moving at 

--- Document Chunk 93 ---
80km/h, 100km/h, 200km/h or even 

--- Document Chunk 94 ---
at 500km/h. Newton’s laws apply 

--- Document Chunk 95 ---
however, the parameters can differ, 

--- Document Chunk 96 ---
whether that's train resistance, motoring 

--- Document Chunk 97 ---
or braking acceleration or adhesion, or 

--- Document Chunk 98 ---
a combination of these. This leads to 

--- Document Chunk 99 ---
metros offering a different challenge to 

--- Document Chunk 100 ---
other railway systems.

--- Document Chunk 101 ---
So, all metro systems face the 

--- Document Chunk 102 ---
same challenges?

--- Document Chunk 103 ---
Whilst most metros face the challenges 

--- Document Chunk 104 ---
of moving large numbers of people 

--- Document Chunk 105 ---
safely through urban areas, several 

--- Document Chunk 106 ---
factors vary from city to city. Although 

--- Document Chunk 107 ---
in some cases, for example in China 

--- Document Chunk 108 ---
where there is rapid development of new 

--- Document Chunk 109 ---
urban railways, there can be a relatively 

--- Document Chunk 110 ---
similar approach for new-build city 

--- Document Chunk 111 ---
railways, that is not the case for most 

--- Document Chunk 112 ---
railways worldwide. 

--- Document Chunk 113 ---
Some metro systems have been 

--- Document Chunk 114 ---
operating for a very long time, for 

--- Document Chunk 115 ---
example London where parts of the 

--- Document Chunk 116 ---
Metropolitan line have followed the 

--- Document Chunk 117 ---
same route since the 1860s. Paris Metro 

--- Document Chunk 118 ---
began operation in 1900 and New York 

--- Document Chunk 119 ---
Subway in 1904. Clearly there have 

--- Document Chunk 120 ---
been multiple upgrades on each railway 

--- Document Chunk 121 ---
over the century, but culture, historical 

--- Document Chunk 122 ---
approaches and unique solutions to 

--- Document Chunk 123 ---
engineering problems have posed 

--- Document Chunk 124 ---
problems ever since. In many well-

--- Document Chunk 125 ---
established cities, it is not straightforward 

--- Document Chunk 126 ---
to dig new tunnels through existing 

--- Document Chunk 127 ---
congested sub-surface areas, as 

--- Document Chunk 128 ---
demonstrated by the recent Crossrail 

--- Document Chunk 129 ---
project in London.

--- Document Chunk 130 ---
One challenge comes from the 

--- Document Chunk 131 ---
infrastructure that current railway 

--- Document Chunk 132 ---
engineers have inherited. There are parts 

--- Document Chunk 133 ---
of the London Underground network 

--- Document Chunk 134 ---
where there are no station overruns 

--- Document Chunk 135 ---
at all, with trains having to stop safely 

--- Document Chunk 136 ---
immediately in front of an immoveable 

--- Document Chunk 137 ---
object such as a station concourse 

--- Document Chunk 138 ---
or even a redundant tunnel boring 

--- Document Chunk 139 ---
shield. Maintaining high performance 

--- Document Chunk 140 ---
running whilst ensuring that overruns 

--- Document Chunk 141 ---
that may cause significant human and 

--- Document Chunk 142 ---
material damage cannot occur is a 

--- Document Chunk 143 ---
significant challenge.

--- Document Chunk 144 ---
Whilst some metros operate entirely 

--- Document Chunk 145 ---
end-to-end within busy urban areas, 

--- Document Chunk 146 ---
others run multiple lines from different 

--- Document Chunk 147 ---
suburbs through common central 

--- Document Chunk 148 ---
sections. One example of this is the Oslo 

--- Document Chunk 149 ---
T-bane where there is a high capacity, 

--- Document Chunk 150 ---
low headway central section, served by 

--- Document Chunk 151 ---
trains running in from the outskirts of 

--- Document Chunk 152 ---
the city. Finding a viable solution that 

--- Document Chunk 153 ---
allows economic fitment and efficient 

--- Document Chunk 154 ---
operation on a railway where there is 

--- Document Chunk 155 ---
a 15-minute headway in places, but a 

--- Document Chunk 156 ---
two-minute headway in others requires 

--- Document Chunk 157 ---
detailed systems engineering.

--- Document Chunk 158 ---
Metros are complex systems of systems needing a range of solutions and interconnections. However when a railway is 

--- Document Chunk 159 ---
over 100 years old the challenges multiply. This photo shows cabling old and new and ancient disconnection boxes on

Holmenkollen station on Oslo Metro. Whilst service on this line is typically one train per 

--- Document Chunk 162 ---
direction every 15 minutes, trains on this route soon join the common central section with 

--- Document Chunk 163 ---
headways around two minutes. This station is also designed to handle extremely high 

--- Document Chunk 164 ---
passenger demand during winter sporting events. Photo Shutterstock/Markus Mainka.

--- Document Chunk 168 ---
Some of the busiest mass transit systems 

--- Document Chunk 169 ---
in the world can be found in areas where 

--- Document Chunk 170 ---
there are monsoon downfalls at varying 

--- Document Chunk 171 ---
intervals. One example is Singapore’s 

--- Document Chunk 172 ---
Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system 

--- Document Chunk 173 ---
which has sections both in tunnel 

--- Document Chunk 174 ---
and on viaducts. 

--- Document Chunk 175 ---
Ensuring that adhesion is adequate 

--- Document Chunk 176 ---
to run at close train intervals in 

--- Document Chunk 177 ---
these exposed areas requires a clear 

--- Document Chunk 178 ---
understanding of the odometry used on 

--- Document Chunk 179 ---
the train to determine current speed and 

--- Document Chunk 180 ---
location and dynamic reduction of brake 

--- Document Chunk 181 ---
rates when low adhesion conditions are 

--- Document Chunk 182 ---
detected with rain detectors at stations. 

--- Document Chunk 183 ---
There are many other examples of 

--- Document Chunk 184 ---
railways that must deal with extreme 

--- Document Chunk 185 ---
weather conditions, be it extreme 

--- Document Chunk 186 ---
heat (for example Riyadh) or passing 

--- Document Chunk 187 ---
typhoons (for example Hong Kong 

--- Document Chunk 188 ---
or Taiwan), where the forces exerted 

--- Document Chunk 189 ---
by high winds can impact braking 

--- Document Chunk 190 ---
distances. Extreme weather has other 

--- Document Chunk 191 ---
impacts, such as forces on PSD (Platform 

--- Document Chunk 192 ---
Screen Doors), and trains which have 

--- Document Chunk 193 ---
to be considered for the platform-train 

--- Document Chunk 194 ---
gap, this can also be an outcome with 

--- Document Chunk 195 ---
tunnel ventilation forces if they are not 

--- Document Chunk 196 ---
considered correctly during design.

--- Document Chunk 197 ---
Do all metros have full train 

--- Document Chunk 198 ---
control systems?

--- Document Chunk 199 ---
Nearly all metros have full 

--- Document Chunk 200 ---
signalling systems. 

--- Document Chunk 201 ---
The vast majority also have at least 

--- Document Chunk 202 ---
a simple form of Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 203 ---
Protection (ATP), based on the use of 

--- Document Chunk 204 ---
mechanical or electronic trainstops that 

--- Document Chunk 205 ---
can cause a train to apply its brakes 

--- Document Chunk 206 ---
should it pass beyond a safe location. 

--- Document Chunk 207 ---
These are linked directly to trackside 

--- Document Chunk 208 ---
signals, and the design of the railway 

--- Document Chunk 209 ---
provides an overlap beyond each 

--- Document Chunk 210 ---
signal, the length of which is designed 

--- Document Chunk 211 ---
to emergency brake a train to rest 

--- Document Chunk 212 ---
within the overlap distance to prevent 

--- Document Chunk 213 ---
collisions with other trains/buffer stops 

--- Document Chunk 214 ---
or derailments at points. Where close 

--- Document Chunk 215 ---
stopping to buffer stops or trains is 

--- Document Chunk 216 ---
required speed control of the train on 

--- Document Chunk 217 ---
the approach is supervised by the ATP to 

--- Document Chunk 218 ---
reduce the required overlap distance. 

--- Document Chunk 219 ---
Since the 1960s metro railways have 

--- Document Chunk 220 ---
invested in technology to allow 

--- Document Chunk 221 ---
performance to be increased whilst 

--- Document Chunk 222 ---
maintaining safety. The provision of ATP 

--- Document Chunk 223 ---
has been combined with Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 224 ---
Operation (ATO) in many cases, allowing 

--- Document Chunk 225 ---
trains to be driven by on-board systems. 

--- Document Chunk 226 ---
This automation has allowed trains to 

--- Document Chunk 227 ---
be driven very close to the safe limits 

--- Document Chunk 228 ---
protected by the ATP, allowing optimum 

--- Document Chunk 229 ---
use of the capacity permitted by the 

--- Document Chunk 230 ---
infrastructure to be achieved.

--- Document Chunk 231 ---
From the 1990s onwards the state 

--- Document Chunk 232 ---
of technology had reached a point 

--- Document Chunk 233 ---
at which the first Communications-

--- Document Chunk 234 ---
Based Train Control (CBTC) systems 

--- Document Chunk 235 ---
could be introduced. Commonplace 

--- Document Chunk 236 ---
for new-build metro projects and 

--- Document Chunk 237 ---
upgrades, CBTC systems continuously 

--- Document Chunk 238 ---
update the position and speed of 

--- Document Chunk 239 ---
each train to determine the safe 

--- Document Chunk 240 ---
speed and distance at which they can 

--- Document Chunk 241 ---
travel at every point along the line to 

--- Document Chunk 242 ---
ensure the safe separation of trains. 

--- Document Chunk 243 ---
The communications medium of the 

--- Document Chunk 244 ---
earlier systems was typically inductive 

--- Document Chunk 245 ---
loop systems in the track, but today’s 

--- Document Chunk 246 ---
systems are typically based on radio 

--- Document Chunk 247 ---
communication. CBTC’s ability to 

--- Document Chunk 248 ---
provide constant updates not only allows 

--- Document Chunk 249 ---
trains to run closer together but also 

--- Document Chunk 250 ---
enhanced control of the running profile 

--- Document Chunk 251 ---
of each train and optimises the collective 

--- Document Chunk 252 ---
behaviour of the service. 

--- Document Chunk 253 ---
The efficient operation of a metro is 

--- Document Chunk 254 ---
dependent on the provision of a highly 

--- Document Chunk 255 ---
functional control centre system. 

--- Document Chunk 256 ---
Automation within these centres has 

--- Document Chunk 257 ---
again developed rapidly in recent 

--- Document Chunk 258 ---
decades, and these systems have 

--- Document Chunk 259 ---
been referred to as Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 260 ---
Supervision (ATS) since the 1960s, 

--- Document Chunk 261 ---
recognising the way that technology 

--- Document Chunk 262 ---
either enacts decisions or advises staff of 

--- Document Chunk 263 ---
the optimum choice that can be made. 

--- Document Chunk 264 ---
What is Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 265 ---
Supervision?

--- Document Chunk 266 ---
A modern metro cannot function 

--- Document Chunk 267 ---
effectively without ATS. As well as 

--- Document Chunk 268 ---
managing the signalling and train 

--- Document Chunk 269 ---
control systems, the ATS will typically 

--- Document Chunk 270 ---
have interfaces to other systems such 

--- Document Chunk 271 ---
as those for passenger information, 

--- Document Chunk 272 ---
maintenance management, Supervisory 

--- Document Chunk 273 ---
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 

--- Document Chunk 274 ---
systems that control the traction 

--- Document Chunk 275 ---
power and station equipment, and now 

--- Document Chunk 276 ---
emerging as a requirement the Rail 

--- Document Chunk 277 ---
Enterprise Asset Management Systems 

--- Document Chunk 278 ---
(REAMS) used to optimise maintenance 

--- Document Chunk 279 ---
and asset replacement. With trains being 

--- Document Chunk 280 ---
automatically driven, the station to 

--- Document Chunk 281 ---
station run times are more predictable 

--- Document Chunk 282 ---
than when driven by human operators 

--- Document Chunk 283 ---
that have individual driving styles. 

--- Document Chunk 284 ---
With predictable and adjustable inter-

--- Document Chunk 285 ---
station run-times the Automatic Train 

--- Document Chunk 286 ---
Regulation (ATR) function of the ATS can 

--- Document Chunk 287 ---
regulate the service to maintain/restore 

--- Document Chunk 288 ---
the timetable or desired headway.

--- Document Chunk 293 ---
Is there an ETCS/CTCS type 

--- Document Chunk 294 ---
system for metros?

--- Document Chunk 295 ---
The lack of requirements for 

--- Document Chunk 296 ---
interoperability between metro railways, 

--- Document Chunk 297 ---
the variations between them, the way 

--- Document Chunk 298 ---
in which they have evolved and the 

--- Document Chunk 299 ---
fact that a limited number of train 

--- Document Chunk 300 ---
types operate on them has led to no 

--- Document Chunk 301 ---
common global standard being adopted 

--- Document Chunk 302 ---
to date. The current situation is that a 

--- Document Chunk 303 ---
small number of suppliers have created 

--- Document Chunk 304 ---
proprietary systems which most new or 

--- Document Chunk 305 ---
updated systems are based on with new 

--- Document Chunk 306 ---
line or upgraded line projects usually 

--- Document Chunk 307 ---
having a single system supplier. 

--- Document Chunk 308 ---
In most cases modifications are made 

--- Document Chunk 309 ---
to tailor the basic systems to the needs 

--- Document Chunk 310 ---
of the cities they are being delivered to. 

--- Document Chunk 311 ---
It is generally the case that the supplier 

--- Document Chunk 312 ---
of trackside equipment will also provide 

--- Document Chunk 313 ---
the onboard equipment necessary for 

--- Document Chunk 314 ---
ATP and ATO functionality, even if the 

--- Document Chunk 315 ---
trains themselves are not manufactured 

--- Document Chunk 316 ---
by them. This affects the procurement 

--- Document Chunk 317 ---
strategy for many authorities as they 

--- Document Chunk 318 ---
must decide to have a common system, 

--- Document Chunk 319 ---
a few preferred suppliers or a complete 

--- Document Chunk 320 ---
free market approach which could result 

--- Document Chunk 321 ---
in all lines having different systems (even 

--- Document Chunk 322 ---
from the same suppliers) and the long-

--- Document Chunk 323 ---
term maintenance and obsolescence 

--- Document Chunk 324 ---
issues these create.

--- Document Chunk 325 ---
Common standards like ETCS bring 

--- Document Chunk 326 ---
commercial advantages to railway 

--- Document Chunk 327 ---
authorities, in particular the ability to 

--- Document Chunk 328 ---
be able to make comparisons between 

--- Document Chunk 329 ---
multiple suppliers when purchasing, 

--- Document Chunk 330 ---
and to be confident that if extensions or 

--- Document Chunk 331 ---
replacements are required, they can – at 

--- Document Chunk 332 ---
least to some extent – be procured from 

--- Document Chunk 333 ---
competing companies. The detailed 

--- Document Chunk 334 ---
definition of the air gap interface means 

--- Document Chunk 335 ---
that onboard equipment from one 

--- Document Chunk 336 ---
company can be expected (guaranteed?) 

--- Document Chunk 337 ---
to function properly with trackside 

--- Document Chunk 338 ---
equipment from other companies. 

--- Document Chunk 339 ---
Whilst initiatives such as the Urban 

--- Document Chunk 340 ---
Guided Transport Management System 

--- Document Chunk 341 ---
(UGTMS) specification and IEEE 

--- Document Chunk 342 ---
1474 series before that, have sought 

--- Document Chunk 343 ---
to make something approaching a 

--- Document Chunk 344 ---
standard, the greatest progress towards 

--- Document Chunk 345 ---
standardisation has been driven by some 

--- Document Chunk 346 ---
of the railways that are large enough 

--- Document Chunk 347 ---
to require it in their procurement 

--- Document Chunk 348 ---
processes. In Paris the Ouragan project 

--- Document Chunk 349 ---
and on New York Metro the Canarsie 

--- Document Chunk 350 ---
line project have aimed to create 

--- Document Chunk 351 ---
environments in which more than one 

--- Document Chunk 352 ---
supplier can deliver current and future 

--- Document Chunk 353 ---
systems based on common interfaces, 

--- Document Chunk 354 ---
but these are based on the specific 

--- Document Chunk 355 ---
needs of those cities. Other cities have 

--- Document Chunk 356 ---
ended up with de facto standards, for 

--- Document Chunk 357 ---
example on the London Underground 

--- Document Chunk 358 ---
one supplier has provided systems for 

--- Document Chunk 359 ---
all except one of the new railways or 

--- Document Chunk 360 ---
line upgrades of the past twenty years, 

--- Document Chunk 361 ---
despite competitive tendering.

--- Document Chunk 362 ---
What else is different  

--- Document Chunk 363 ---
about metros?

--- Document Chunk 364 ---
There are a wide range of interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 365 ---
that metro train control systems 

--- Document Chunk 366 ---
must deal with that main line railways 

--- Document Chunk 367 ---
typically don’t. 

--- Document Chunk 368 ---
On the trackside these can be as diverse 

--- Document Chunk 369 ---
as interlocking to flood gates or bomb 

--- Document Chunk 370 ---
blast doors that block tracks, they can 

--- Document Chunk 371 ---
also include detectors to ensure that big 

--- Document Chunk 372 ---
trains can’t be sent down small tunnels 

--- Document Chunk 373 ---
or a wide range of protection devices 

--- Document Chunk 374 ---
to allow track access for maintenance. 

--- Document Chunk 375 ---
For new underground metro systems, 

--- Document Chunk 376 ---
the ATS system regulates the number of 

--- Document Chunk 377 ---
trains permitted in a ventilation section 

--- Document Chunk 378 ---
to ensure smoke control strategies can 

--- Document Chunk 379 ---
move smoke away from passengers 

--- Document Chunk 380 ---
in the event of a fire. This is supported 

--- Document Chunk 381 ---
by the ATS providing train location 

--- Document Chunk 382 ---
information to the ventilation system 

--- Document Chunk 383 ---
SCADA so that the best ventilation and 

--- Document Chunk 384 ---
evacuation strategies can be presented 

--- Document Chunk 385 ---
to the operator. The ATS also manages 

--- Document Chunk 386 ---
train movements and authorities to react 

--- Document Chunk 387 ---
to fire detection, for example holding 

--- Document Chunk 388 ---
trains that have reported a potential fire 

--- Document Chunk 389 ---
on board at the next platform to facilitate 

--- Document Chunk 390 ---
evacuation and not dispatching trains 

--- Document Chunk 391 ---
towards fire incidents.

--- Document Chunk 392 ---
One of the most common systems 

--- Document Chunk 393 ---
that metro signalling systems have 

--- Document Chunk 394 ---
to interface with are Platform Screen 

--- Document Chunk 395 ---
Doors (PSDs) which provide positive 

--- Document Chunk 396 ---
segregation between trains and 

--- Document Chunk 397 ---
passengers within stations. These 

--- Document Chunk 398 ---
are used for environmental reasons, 

--- Document Chunk 399 ---
ensuring that station systems operate 

--- Document Chunk 400 ---
efficiently without trying to air condition 

--- Document Chunk 401 ---
tunnels, and for safety, allowing trains 

--- Document Chunk 402 ---
to enter stations at full line speed, 

--- Document Chunk 403 ---
if braking distances allow, whilst 

--- Document Chunk 404 ---
keeping passengers away from the 

--- Document Chunk 405 ---
track. Dwell times can be managed 

--- Document Chunk 406 ---
efficiently, providing another piece in 

--- Document Chunk 407 ---
the jigsaw of ensuring the delivery of the 

--- Document Chunk 408 ---
highest capacity.

--- Document Chunk 409 ---
PSDs have to interface with train and 

--- Document Chunk 410 ---
trackside equipment, ensuring that 

--- Document Chunk 411 ---
both train doors and PSD operation is 

--- Document Chunk 412 ---
synchronised to reduce the entrapment 

--- Document Chunk 413 ---
risk of passengers between the train 

--- Document Chunk 414 ---
and PSDs. There are various failure 

--- Document Chunk 415 ---
modes that need to be dealt with which 

--- Document Chunk 416 ---
increase the complexity of the interface. 

--- Document Chunk 417 ---
One of the most common systems that metro signalling systems have to interface with are 

--- Document Chunk 418 ---
Platform Screen Doors (PSDs). These half-height units are in Singapore.

--- Document Chunk 422 ---
What does a typical metro 

--- Document Chunk 423 ---
signalling and train control 

--- Document Chunk 424 ---
system look like?

--- Document Chunk 425 ---
This section describes the typical 

--- Document Chunk 426 ---
architecture and subsystems of a CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 427 ---
metro train control system, as shown in 

--- Document Chunk 428 ---
the simplified block diagram in Figure 1. 

--- Document Chunk 429 ---
There are subtle differences between 

--- Document Chunk 430 ---
systems from different suppliers as 

--- Document Chunk 431 ---
delivered to different cities, but the basic 

--- Document Chunk 432 ---
functions remain the same, although 

--- Document Chunk 433 ---
in some cases they are delivered by 

--- Document Chunk 434 ---
different subsystems.

--- Document Chunk 435 ---
As in most signalling systems for any 

--- Document Chunk 436 ---
type of railway the heart of the system 

--- Document Chunk 437 ---
is one or more interlockings, or devices 

--- Document Chunk 438 ---
performing interlocking functionality. 

--- Document Chunk 439 ---
The interlocking may be combined with 

--- Document Chunk 440 ---
the ATP into a zone controller or work 

--- Document Chunk 441 ---
with a separate ATP system. Unlike main 

--- Document Chunk 442 ---
line systems that have equipment rooms 

--- Document Chunk 443 ---
and remote line side cabinets metros 

--- Document Chunk 444 ---
have restricted space in tunnels and with 

--- Document Chunk 445 ---
ATO provide a high-risk environment 

--- Document Chunk 446 ---
for maintainers so active trackside 

--- Document Chunk 447 ---
equipment is kept to a minimum. Metros 

--- Document Chunk 448 ---
can have a range of architectures with 

--- Document Chunk 449 ---
the most common being centralised or 

--- Document Chunk 450 ---
sectorised with sectors of two to three 

--- Document Chunk 451 ---
stations which minimises the impact of a 

--- Document Chunk 452 ---
sector failure.

--- Document Chunk 453 ---
The interlocking subsystem is 

--- Document Chunk 454 ---
responsible for the safe routing of trains 

--- Document Chunk 455 ---
to prevent collisions or derailments at 

--- Document Chunk 456 ---
junctions and for preventing trains from 

--- Document Chunk 457 ---
travelling in opposing directions on the 

--- Document Chunk 458 ---
same section of track. Interlockings 

--- Document Chunk 459 ---
are directly responsible for the safe 

--- Document Chunk 460 ---
operation of trains and so must be 

--- Document Chunk 461 ---
designed to Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 4. 

--- Document Chunk 462 ---
The interlockings react to commands 

--- Document Chunk 463 ---
from the ATS system to ensure that 

--- Document Chunk 464 ---
trains are routed in accordance with 

--- Document Chunk 465 ---
the timetable. 

--- Document Chunk 466 ---
Metro railways tend not to need so 

--- Document Chunk 467 ---
many trackside signals, especially for 

--- Document Chunk 468 ---
GoA3/4 systems where there is no train 

--- Document Chunk 469 ---
driver at the front of the train, instead 

--- Document Chunk 470 ---
they relay all necessary movement 

--- Document Chunk 471 ---
authority information directly to 

--- Document Chunk 472 ---
onboard computers, or to the cab if 

--- Document Chunk 473 ---
there is a driver.

--- Document Chunk 474 ---
The ATP subsystem determines the 

--- Document Chunk 475 ---
limit of movement authority for each 

--- Document Chunk 476 ---
train, which determines where the 

--- Document Chunk 477 ---
train is permitted to travel, based on 

--- Document Chunk 478 ---
the routes set by the interlocking and 

--- Document Chunk 479 ---
the position of trains within the route. 

--- Document Chunk 480 ---
The ATP determines the position of all 

--- Document Chunk 481 ---
trains using train position reports and/or 

--- Document Chunk 482 ---
interlocking train detection status. How 

--- Document Chunk 483 ---
this is done varies greatly from system to 

--- Document Chunk 484 ---
system. ATP subsystems also supervise 

--- Document Chunk 485 ---
train movements and ensure that they 

--- Document Chunk 486 ---
only occur on authorised routes, in 

--- Document Chunk 487 ---
the correct direction and within the 

--- Document Chunk 488 ---
limits of the movement authority. The 

--- Document Chunk 489 ---
ATP supervises the safety of all train 

--- Document Chunk 490 ---
movements whether train control is from 

--- Document Chunk 491 ---
the ATO or the train operator, and as a 

--- Document Chunk 492 ---
result the ATP is also designed to SIL 4. 

--- Document Chunk 493 ---
ATP equipment is situated trackside 

--- Document Chunk 494 ---
and on the train.

--- Document Chunk 495 ---
ATO is the subsystem that drives the train 

--- Document Chunk 496 ---
between stations within the constraints 

--- Document Chunk 497 ---
established by the ATP subsystem. 

--- Document Chunk 498 ---
The functionality of the ATO will vary 

--- Document Chunk 499 ---
depending on the grade of automation – 

--- Document Chunk 500 ---
if the railway is fully automated the ATO 

--- Document Chunk 501 ---
will need to replace all the functions of 

--- Document Chunk 502 ---
the driver in normal operation, degraded, 

--- Document Chunk 503 ---
emergency and fault modes. Actions 

--- Document Chunk 504 ---
are either automated or remotely 

--- Document Chunk 505 ---
controlled from the control centre. The 

--- Document Chunk 506 ---
ATO replaces the train operator but 

--- Document Chunk 507 ---
one of the goals for automated systems 

--- Document Chunk 508 ---
is to eliminate the errors that humans 

--- Document Chunk 509 ---
introduce, so the ATO subsystem is 

--- Document Chunk 510 ---
typically defined as a SIL 2 system. 

--- Document Chunk 511 ---
Allocation of SIL to the subsystems has 

--- Document Chunk 512 ---
varying approaches, in that respect 

--- Document Chunk 513 ---
metros are no different to other 

--- Document Chunk 514 ---
railways, a balance is struck following 

--- Document Chunk 515 ---
the requirements and guidance from 

--- Document Chunk 516 ---
governing standards, but that outcome is 

--- Document Chunk 517 ---
not identical for what may appear to be 

--- Document Chunk 518 ---
the same system function.

--- Document Chunk 519 ---
ATP systems need to know both where 

--- Document Chunk 520 ---
the train is, and how fast it is moving, 

--- Document Chunk 521 ---
to a high degree of accuracy all the 

--- Document Chunk 522 ---
time. CBTC solutions are moving block 

--- Document Chunk 523 ---
systems where the available block length 

--- Document Chunk 524 ---
to the train ahead or other obstruction 

--- Document Chunk 525 ---
determines the maximum speed a train 

--- Document Chunk 526 ---
can travel and as the train ahead moves 

--- Document Chunk 527 ---
so does the available block. This means 

--- Document Chunk 528 ---
that safe operation is entirely dependent 

--- Document Chunk 529 ---
upon having this information available 

--- Document Chunk 530 ---
all the time so the decision not to apply 

--- Document Chunk 531 ---
the emergency brakes can be made. 

--- Document Chunk 532 ---

information from multiple systems 

--- Document Chunk 580 ---
such as a tachogenerator or speed 

--- Document Chunk 581 ---
probe determining how many times a 

--- Document Chunk 582 ---
wheel has rotated, a doppler radar or 

--- Document Chunk 583 ---
accelerometer to allow adjustments 

--- Document Chunk 584 ---
based on wheel slip or slide or changing 

--- Document Chunk 585 ---
wheel size, and absolute position 

--- Document Chunk 586 ---
references based on trackside beacons 

--- Document Chunk 587 ---
which are read by the train as it passes 

--- Document Chunk 588 ---
over them to assure location.

--- Document Chunk 589 ---
For modern CBTC systems there 

--- Document Chunk 590 ---
will be additional functionality that 

--- Document Chunk 591 ---
could be included as part of the ATO 

--- Document Chunk 592 ---
subsystem or by the provision of an 

--- Document Chunk 593 ---
additional processor unit. The Train Data 

--- Document Chunk 594 ---
Management System (TDMS) provides 

--- Document Chunk 595 ---
an interface between the signalling and 

--- Document Chunk 596 ---
train systems for functions that support 

--- Document Chunk 597 ---
train operation but are not directly 

--- Document Chunk 598 ---
involved with the train driving. This 

--- Document Chunk 599 ---
is especially true for fully automated 

--- Document Chunk 600 ---
trains that need to be told to ‘wake’ 

--- Document Chunk 601 ---
or ‘sleep’, configured for the correct 

--- Document Chunk 602 ---
mode of operation such as heating, 

--- Document Chunk 603 ---
air conditioning, lighting controls, 

--- Document Chunk 604 ---
closing dampers for train washing and 

--- Document Chunk 605 ---
the co-ordination of isolated doors 

--- Document Chunk 606 ---
for PSD operation.

--- Document Chunk 607 ---
Communication between the trackside 

--- Document Chunk 608 ---
and onboard systems is established 

--- Document Chunk 609 ---
over a trackside radio system providing 

--- Document Chunk 610 ---
a highly reliable link over which high 

--- Document Chunk 611 ---
integrity data can be transferred. 

--- Document Chunk 612 ---
There is a range of ways of making 

--- Document Chunk 613 ---
this happen, for example using highly 

--- Document Chunk 614 ---
directional antennas or ‘leaky feeder’ 

--- Document Chunk 615 ---
cables in tunnels or more conventional 

--- Document Chunk 616 ---
base stations in open air areas. Many 

--- Document Chunk 617 ---
systems use Wi-Fi in the ISM (Industrial, 

--- Document Chunk 618 ---
Scientific and Medical) bands but can 

--- Document Chunk 619 ---
also use 4G/5G, with cities in China 

--- Document Chunk 620 ---
mandating 4G as it is deemed less 

--- Document Chunk 621 ---
prone to interference. With IP based 

--- Document Chunk 622 ---
communications between sub-systems 

--- Document Chunk 623 ---
the CBTC can effectively be bearer 

--- Document Chunk 624 ---
agnostic if the required bandwidth and 

--- Document Chunk 625 ---
availability requirements can be met.

--- Document Chunk 626 ---
The ATS subsystem is responsible for the 

--- Document Chunk 627 ---
overall line control function, presenting 

--- Document Chunk 628 ---
the status of the railway to the operators, 

--- Document Chunk 629 ---
controlling trains and providing the 

--- Document Chunk 630 ---
operators with tools to both configure 

--- Document Chunk 631 ---
the timetable and the ability to intervene 

--- Document Chunk 632 ---
when the service deviates beyond the 

--- Document Chunk 633 ---
recovery capability of the ATS subsystem.

--- Document Chunk 634 ---
Grades of automation

--- Document Chunk 635 ---
As technology develops the level 

--- Document Chunk 636 ---
of automation of metros is rapidly 

--- Document Chunk 637 ---
increasing. The level of automation 

--- Document Chunk 638 ---
is generally measured by a railway’s 

--- Document Chunk 639 ---
Grade of Automation or GoA as 

--- Document Chunk 640 ---
illustrated in Figure 2. 

--- Document Chunk 641 ---
GoA2 railways retain a train operator in 

--- Document Chunk 642 ---
the cab but use computer systems to 

--- Document Chunk 643 ---
drive the train from location to location. 

--- Document Chunk 644 ---
ATP is required. In the event of ATO 

--- Document Chunk 645 ---
failure the driver can operate the train. 

--- Document Chunk 646 ---
An example would be the Central line 

--- Document Chunk 647 ---
of London Underground. GoA2 systems 

--- Document Chunk 648 ---
form most metro train control systems 

--- Document Chunk 649 ---
currently in service around the world.

--- Document Chunk 650 ---
GoA3 railways no longer need a full-time 

--- Document Chunk 651 ---
operator in the cab. Whilst there is still 

--- Document Chunk 652 ---
someone on the train who can operate it 

--- Document Chunk 653 ---
in the event of system failure, the train’s 

--- Document Chunk 654 ---
systems are entirely responsible for the 

--- Document Chunk 655 ---
operation of the train. The operator is 

--- Document Chunk 656 ---
freed up for passenger interaction. An 

--- Document Chunk 657 ---
example would be the Docklands Light 

--- Document Chunk 658 ---
Railway in London.

--- Document Chunk 659 ---
Finally, GoA4 railways need no-one 

--- Document Chunk 660 ---
on the train. They have sufficient 

--- Document Chunk 661 ---
automation to fully manage the 

--- Document Chunk 662 ---
opening and closing of doors, making 

--- Document Chunk 663 ---
the decision to start, and dealing 

--- Document Chunk 664 ---
with the majority of failures that can 

--- Document Chunk 665 ---
occur. An example would be Line 14 of 

--- Document Chunk 666 ---
the Paris Metro.

--- Document Chunk 667 ---
GoA3 and GoA4 systems need to be 

--- Document Chunk 668 ---
designed with appropriate obstruction 

--- Document Chunk 669 ---
detection and mitigation – there isn’t 

--- Document Chunk 670 ---
an operator looking out of the front 

--- Document Chunk 671 ---
window to identify that the train is likely 

--- Document Chunk 672 ---
to hit, or has hit, an obstruction. This is 

--- Document Chunk 673 ---
straightforward for tunnels, but not so 

--- Document Chunk 674 ---
simple for metros operating at grade 

--- Document Chunk 675 ---
or on viaducts.

--- Document Chunk 676 ---
GoA4 railways require detailed systems 

--- Document Chunk 677 ---
engineering to establish and mitigate 

--- Document Chunk 678 ---
the risks associated with not having an 

--- Document Chunk 679 ---
operator. This may involve the use of 

--- Document Chunk 680 ---
PSDs to manage the platform interface, 

--- Document Chunk 681 ---
or having enhanced communication 

--- Document Chunk 682 ---
systems to allow control centre 

--- Document Chunk 683 ---
operators to talk directly to passengers 

--- Document Chunk 684 ---
when issues arise.

--- Document Chunk 685 ---
Some key requirements are redundancy 

--- Document Chunk 686 ---
of equipment to prevent stalled trains, 

--- Document Chunk 687 ---
critical alarm reporting from train to the 

--- Document Chunk 688 ---
control centre and passenger-initiated 

--- Document Chunk 689 ---
safe evacuation in tunnels. These are 

--- Document Chunk 690 ---
generally specific to individual metros.

--- Document Chunk 691 ---
It’s all about  

--- Document Chunk 692 ---
system engineering

--- Document Chunk 693 ---
The systems are typically well contained 

--- Document Chunk 694 ---
and there are rarely challenges like 

--- Document Chunk 695 ---
level crossings (although some metros 

--- Document Chunk 696 ---
do have them) or frequent trespass 

--- Document Chunk 697 ---
incidents, however this is balanced

--- Document Chunk 730 ---
against the fact that metros are 

--- Document Chunk 731 ---
complex systems of systems. Each 

--- Document Chunk 732 ---
subsystem, for example ATP or ATO, 

--- Document Chunk 733 ---
are complex systems in their own right, 

--- Document Chunk 734 ---
but the overall solution involves myriad 

--- Document Chunk 735 ---
interfaces and interactions which need 

--- Document Chunk 736 ---
to be fully understood and managed 

--- Document Chunk 737 ---
if overall requirements, including 

--- Document Chunk 738 ---
safety and capacity, are to be met and 

--- Document Chunk 739 ---
proven to be met.

--- Document Chunk 740 ---
Systems engineering underpins the 

--- Document Chunk 741 ---
successful deployment of most metro 

--- Document Chunk 742 ---
signalling and train control projects, with 

--- Document Chunk 743 ---
the ‘V’ lifecycle clearly and accurately 

--- Document Chunk 744 ---
implemented throughout.

--- Document Chunk 745 ---
Reliability, Availability, Maintainability 

--- Document Chunk 746 ---
and Safety (RAMS) are evaluated in 

--- Document Chunk 747 ---
detail throughout metro projects 

--- Document Chunk 748 ---
(as explained in the article by Boyd 

--- Document Chunk 749 ---
McKillican in IRSE News January 2022, 

--- Document Chunk 750 ---
irse info/irsenews295). Reliability and 

--- Document Chunk 751 ---
maintainability directly drive availability 

--- Document Chunk 752 ---
(how much of the time the railway is 

--- Document Chunk 753 ---
available for service being based on how 

--- Document Chunk 754 ---
often individual parts go wrong and how 

--- Document Chunk 755 ---
long they take to fix), and safety in turn 

--- Document Chunk 756 ---
depends on the system operating as 

--- Document Chunk 757 ---
planned. With any mass transit system 

--- Document Chunk 758 ---
operating at high passenger loads, a 

--- Document Chunk 759 ---
stopped train can in itself be dangerous, 

--- Document Chunk 760 ---
particularly if traction power has to be 

--- Document Chunk 761 ---
removed and air conditioning/ventilation 

--- Document Chunk 762 ---
is no longer operative. SIL levels of the 

--- Document Chunk 763 ---
overall system need to be apportioned 

--- Document Chunk 764 ---
to subsystems to ensure the rate at 

--- Document Chunk 765 ---
which unsafe conditions could occur 

--- Document Chunk 766 ---
are clearly understood and managed. 

--- Document Chunk 767 ---
In the same way the impact of failure 

--- Document Chunk 768 ---
modes and their criticality needs to be 

--- Document Chunk 769 ---
established throughout the engineering 

--- Document Chunk 770 ---
phases of projects in order to ensure that 

--- Document Chunk 771 ---
the required levels are met, not just on 

--- Document Chunk 772 ---
opening day but throughout the service 

--- Document Chunk 773 ---
life which can typically be 20 to 25 years.

--- Document Chunk 774 ---
Modern metros are designed to deal 

--- Document Chunk 775 ---
with such incidents and the CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 776 ---
technology is considered when planning 

--- Document Chunk 777 ---
the line in terms of overruns and 

--- Document Chunk 778 ---
optimising safety and performance. Old 

--- Document Chunk 779 ---
systems are generally more of an ALARP 

--- Document Chunk 780 ---
(As Low as Reasonably Practicable) 

--- Document Chunk 781 ---
approach to get as safe as possible 

--- Document Chunk 782 ---
given the constraints. The term ALARP 

--- Document Chunk 783 ---
is subtlety different to SFAIRP (So Far 

--- Document Chunk 784 ---
As Is Reasonably Practical), ALARP 

--- Document Chunk 785 ---
and SFAIRP both have the concept of 

--- Document Chunk 786 ---
implementing hazard controls if practical 

--- Document Chunk 787 ---
and not grossly disproportionate to the 

--- Document Chunk 788 ---
benefit, however ALARP is presented as 

--- Document Chunk 789 ---
having a threshold, SFAIRP does not and 

--- Document Chunk 790 ---
forces evidence that possible, realistic 

--- Document Chunk 791 ---
and relevant hazard controls have been 

--- Document Chunk 792 ---
considered and included, unless they are 

--- Document Chunk 793 ---
grossly disproportionate to the benefit.

--- Document Chunk 794 ---
Computer simulation is widely used to 

--- Document Chunk 795 ---
ensure that the equipment provided 

--- Document Chunk 796 ---
delivers the performance necessary. 

--- Document Chunk 797 ---
This is the only realistic approach for 

--- Document Chunk 798 ---
CBTC systems to determine where the 

--- Document Chunk 799 ---
pinch points are as traditional signal to 

--- Document Chunk 800 ---
signal type headway calculations are 

--- Document Chunk 801 ---
not applicable when multiple trains 

--- Document Chunk 802 ---
can enter a route. This has been a 

--- Document Chunk 803 ---
science developed since the 1980s 

--- Document Chunk 804 ---
and is depended upon by railway 

--- Document Chunk 805 ---
authorities and suppliers alike now. 

--- Document Chunk 806 ---
For more information about how this 

--- Document Chunk 807 ---
works see the article on the topic 

--- Document Chunk 808 ---
in the May 2022 issue of IRSE News 

--- Document Chunk 809 ---
(irse.info/irsenews288).

--- Document Chunk 810 ---
System integration is also essential if 

--- Document Chunk 811 ---
multiple systems are to be brought 

--- Document Chunk 812 ---
together smoothly and all interfaces 

--- Document Chunk 813 ---
proven before delivering solutions on 

--- Document Chunk 814 ---
the railway. A strong example of this is 

--- Document Chunk 815 ---
the integration carried out for London’s 

--- Document Chunk 816 ---
Crossrail over the past couple of years. 

--- Document Chunk 817 ---
Full emulation, and later target hardware, 

--- Document Chunk 818 ---
of the three signalling solutions and two 

--- Document Chunk 819 ---
ATP solutions on the line were integrated 

--- Document Chunk 820 ---
in the lab with train carried systems and 

--- Document Chunk 821 ---
PSD control equipment to significantly 

--- Document Chunk 822 ---
de-risk the hugely complex project. 

--- Document Chunk 823 ---
Other railways take similar approaches, 

--- Document Chunk 824 ---
for example Singapore’s LTA mandates 

--- Document Chunk 825 ---
the use of offsite test track testing as 

--- Document Chunk 826 ---
well as building an integrated test track 

--- Document Chunk 827 ---
centre in Singapore, Melbourne has an 

--- Document Chunk 828 ---
Integrated Test lab (ITL). Test tracks are 

--- Document Chunk 829 ---
essential for modern complex CBTC 

--- Document Chunk 830 ---
systems to ensure that the signalling 

--- Document Chunk 831 ---
equipment is fully integrated and 

--- Document Chunk 832 ---
tested for all trains before delivery 

--- Document Chunk 833 ---
to the customer.

--- Document Chunk 834 ---
Delivering metro signalling and 

--- Document Chunk 835 ---
train control systems

--- Document Chunk 836 ---
In metro railways we refer to ‘greenfield’ 

--- Document Chunk 837 ---
and ‘brownfield’ sites. Greenfield systems 

--- Document Chunk 838 ---
are provided to new railways that are not 

--- Document Chunk 839 ---
currently in operation. These projects 

--- Document Chunk 840 ---
generally involve extended tested and 

--- Document Chunk 841 ---
trial operation phases during which the 

--- Document Chunk 842 ---
systems that were proved in the off-site 

--- Document Chunk 843 ---
integration phase are proved to operate 

--- Document Chunk 844 ---
as expected in real life situations. Whilst 

--- Document Chunk 845 ---
not straightforward for complex modern 

--- Document Chunk 846 ---
railways, this has the advantage of not 

--- Document Chunk 847 ---
impacting passenger services. This 

--- Document Chunk 848 ---
may require an additional temporary 

--- Document Chunk 849 ---
control centre to deal with the migration 

--- Document Chunk 850 ---
as a line will typically open in stages. 

--- Document Chunk 851 ---
Great care has to be taken during the 

--- Document Chunk 852 ---
migration testing to ensure that the 

--- Document Chunk 853 ---
stages under test do not affect those 

--- Document Chunk 854 ---
already in service.

--- Document Chunk 855 ---
Brownfield systems are upgrades 

--- Document Chunk 856 ---
of existing railways. In some (rare) 

--- Document Chunk 857 ---
cases it is possible to shut down the 

--- Document Chunk 858 ---
railway completely and carry out the 

--- Document Chunk 859 ---
engineering in the same way as for a 

--- Document Chunk 860 ---
greenfield site. However, reality is that 

--- Document Chunk 861 ---
if there is a business case to upgrade 

--- Document Chunk 862 ---
an existing railway it is likely to be an 

--- Document Chunk 863 ---
important transport artery, and closing 

--- Document Chunk 864 ---
it is not likely to be viable. Upgrades 

--- Document Chunk 865 ---
therefore often involve complex 

--- Document Chunk 866 ---
migration from old to new systems 

--- Document Chunk 867 ---
using ‘overlay’ or ‘underlay’ approaches 

--- Document Chunk 868 ---
that allow both old and new systems 

--- Document Chunk 869 ---
to co-exist for some time. This can be 

--- Document Chunk 870 ---
hugely complex in terms of managing 

--- Document Chunk 871 ---
train fleets, especially if the rolling 

--- Document Chunk 872 ---
stock is not being replaced at the time 

--- Document Chunk 873 ---
of the upgrade. There is rarely enough 

--- Document Chunk 874 ---
space on a train for two types of ATP/

--- Document Chunk 875 ---
London's Crossrail project, now operating as the Elizabeth line, made extensive use of integration 

--- Document Chunk 876 ---
facilities to enable the introduction of CBTC operation in a highly complex configuration.

--- Document Chunk 879 ---
ATO equipment and their associated 

--- Document Chunk 880 ---
peripherals, and interfacing two systems 

--- Document Chunk 881 ---
to one train can be challenging. Space 

--- Document Chunk 882 ---
has to be found – or created – for 

--- Document Chunk 883 ---
example, under seats or in cubicles 

--- Document Chunk 884 ---
added in passenger carriages.

--- Document Chunk 885 ---
Migration in this manner can 

--- Document Chunk 886 ---
often take many years for any 

--- Document Chunk 887 ---
appreciable size of metro.

--- Document Chunk 888 ---
Maintaining metro signalling 

--- Document Chunk 889 ---
and train control systems

--- Document Chunk 890 ---
Keeping a metro system operational 

--- Document Chunk 891 ---
once it has been installed can also offer 

--- Document Chunk 892 ---
challenges. In most cases the foremost 

--- Document Chunk 893 ---
amongst these will be getting access 

--- Document Chunk 894 ---
to trackside equipment to carry out 

--- Document Chunk 895 ---
maintenance. Many city railways operate 

--- Document Chunk 896 ---
for 24 hours a day, most only have brief 

--- Document Chunk 897 ---
shutdowns of four to five hours per 

--- Document Chunk 898 ---
night. The time available for safe access 

--- Document Chunk 899 ---
is then further limited by the need to 

--- Document Chunk 900 ---
remove traction current and prove the 

--- Document Chunk 901 ---
railway safe – and the time necessary 

--- Document Chunk 902 ---
to ensure that after the work has been 

--- Document Chunk 903 ---
carried out, all plant and staff have safely 

--- Document Chunk 904 ---
left the railway. A few railways (e.g. parts 

--- Document Chunk 905 ---
of the New York Subway) have multiple 

--- Document Chunk 906 ---
lines which allow trains to keep running 

--- Document Chunk 907 ---
at a reduced level whilst work is being 

--- Document Chunk 908 ---
carried out, others support bidirectional 

--- Document Chunk 909 ---
working which fulfils the same function.

--- Document Chunk 910 ---
Obsolescence can also introduce further 

--- Document Chunk 911 ---
challenges. Metro signalling and train 

--- Document Chunk 912 ---
control solutions tend to be towards the 

--- Document Chunk 913 ---
higher technology end of the spectrum, 

--- Document Chunk 914 ---
largely due to the need to provide high-

--- Document Chunk 915 ---
capacity operation through the use of 

--- Document Chunk 916 ---
innovative techniques. The railways 

--- Document Chunk 917 ---
also tend to be early adopters of new 

--- Document Chunk 918 ---
ideas, for example some of the earliest 

--- Document Chunk 919 ---
uses of high integrity processor-based 

--- Document Chunk 920 ---
safety systems were on metros. Over the 

--- Document Chunk 921 ---
service life of a system (typically 20 years 

--- Document Chunk 922 ---
or more), this means supporting those 

--- Document Chunk 923 ---
technologies can require skills and tools 

--- Document Chunk 924 ---
that become harder to source. 

--- Document Chunk 925 ---
As an example of this many systems 

--- Document Chunk 926 ---
from the 1980s and 1990s made the use 

--- Document Chunk 927 ---
of microprocessors designed to support 

--- Document Chunk 928 ---
digital signal processing in a highly 

--- Document Chunk 929 ---
efficient way. As the decades passed 

--- Document Chunk 930 ---
and standard devices became powerful 

--- Document Chunk 931 ---
enough to remove the advantages 

--- Document Chunk 932 ---
of using special purpose chips, the 

--- Document Chunk 933 ---
knowledge of the programming 

--- Document Chunk 934 ---
languages and assembler code used to 

--- Document Chunk 935 ---
develop the original solutions faded, and 

--- Document Chunk 936 ---
emulators, compilers and test software 

--- Document Chunk 937 ---
became harder to source. In some cases, 

--- Document Chunk 938 ---
railways have even bought the rights to 

--- Document Chunk 939 ---
the masks for the processors in order 

--- Document Chunk 940 ---
to mitigate the risk of unavailability of 

--- Document Chunk 941 ---
key components.

--- Document Chunk 942 ---
With the high development costs 

--- Document Chunk 943 ---
of new products suppliers are now 

--- Document Chunk 944 ---
starting to use generic hardware that 

--- Document Chunk 945 ---
can be configured for either main line 

--- Document Chunk 946 ---
or metro use, thus providing a larger 

--- Document Chunk 947 ---
user base which makes obsolescence 

--- Document Chunk 948 ---
management more cost effective with a 

--- Document Chunk 949 ---
smaller range of products.

--- Document Chunk 950 ---
People and skills

--- Document Chunk 951 ---
Whilst many of the skills necessary 

--- Document Chunk 952 ---
for metro signalling and train control 

--- Document Chunk 953 ---
are the same as on main line railways, 

--- Document Chunk 954 ---
the experience gained of delivering a 

--- Document Chunk 955 ---
particular type of system or meeting 

--- Document Chunk 956 ---
the needs of a particular railway can be 

--- Document Chunk 957 ---
hard to gain and maintain. There tends 

--- Document Chunk 958 ---
to be a migration around the world as 

--- Document Chunk 959 ---
those people with that specific metro 

--- Document Chunk 960 ---
knowledge are encouraged to move 

--- Document Chunk 961 ---
from city to city as major innovative 

--- Document Chunk 962 ---
projects are undertaken.

--- Document Chunk 963 ---
With processor-based systems it is much 

--- Document Chunk 964 ---
harder for authorities to fully understand 

--- Document Chunk 965 ---
the technology they are buying unless 

--- Document Chunk 966 ---
they set up their own labs such as RATP 

--- Document Chunk 967 ---
in Paris. Thus, the skills that could be 

--- Document Chunk 968 ---
gained by working on older relay-based 

--- Document Chunk 969 ---
systems are harder to obtain when 

--- Document Chunk 970 ---
accepting black box type systems with 

--- Document Chunk 971 ---
proprietary software. As an industry we 

--- Document Chunk 972 ---
need to ensure we are supporting the 

--- Document Chunk 973 ---
development of those skills and the 

--- Document Chunk 974 ---
underpinning knowledge for the decades 

--- Document Chunk 975 ---
to come. The importance of systems 

--- Document Chunk 976 ---
engineering, RAMS analysis, simulation 

--- Document Chunk 977 ---
and integration cannot be overstated, 

--- Document Chunk 978 ---
and the understanding of the particular 

--- Document Chunk 979 ---
needs of urban railways is important. 

--- Document Chunk 980 ---
Summary – and to find  

--- Document Chunk 981 ---
out more

--- Document Chunk 982 ---
In summary metro railways tend to have 

--- Document Chunk 983 ---
some common characteristics, but since 

--- Document Chunk 984 ---
they do not need to interoperate and 

--- Document Chunk 985 ---
some have been operating for over 100 

--- Document Chunk 986 ---
years, they have tended to evolve in 

--- Document Chunk 987 ---
isolation from one another. The result 

--- Document Chunk 988 ---
of this is a situation in which proprietary 

--- Document Chunk 989 ---
train control systems are procured and 

--- Document Chunk 990 ---
altered to meet the specific needs and 

--- Document Chunk 991 ---
expectations of different railways, and 

--- Document Chunk 992 ---
standardisation is limited.

--- Document Chunk 993 ---
There are many common elements to 

--- Document Chunk 994 ---
most solutions, and nearly all modern 

--- Document Chunk 995 ---
systems are based on CBTC technology 

--- Document Chunk 996 ---
with varying grades of automation. 

--- Document Chunk 997 ---
Development is rapid, particularly in 

--- Document Chunk 998 ---
Asia, with high rates of investment 

--- Document Chunk 999 ---
in sustainable, highly reliable, high-

--- Document Chunk 1000 ---
capacity public transport systems. Many 

--- Document Chunk 1001 ---
of the skills necessary for deployment 

--- Document Chunk 1002 ---
of these systems are common with all 

--- Document Chunk 1003 ---
other types of railway engineering, but 

--- Document Chunk 1004 ---
there are specific requirements around 

--- Document Chunk 1005 ---
some techniques.

--- Document Chunk 1006 ---
This is a fascinating and complex area of 

--- Document Chunk 1007 ---
our industry, and one in which there is 

--- Document Chunk 1008 ---
significant growth 

--- Document Chunk 1009 ---
and opportunity.
