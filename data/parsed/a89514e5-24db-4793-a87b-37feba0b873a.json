Current\nsignalling systems have reached their limits. However, new alternatives that align with European\nobjectives — such as creating a high-capacity, integrated railway network by removing interoperability\nbarriers, providing full integration solutions, and speeding up innovation — offer a way forward.\nERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), is one of the\nimplementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context of FP2 R2DATO, WP37 aims at\ndeveloping migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the implementation of HTD. In this\ndeliverable, we set the requirements specification for the simulations that will be performed by FP1\nWP8/9. To this end, we provide a methodology for defining the requirements specification to FP1\nWP8/9. In particular, we define performance indicators related to capacity and robustness, where\ncapacity is assessed in simulations without external delays and robustness in simulations with\nexternal delays (compared to the undelayed simulations).\nThis deliverable addresses the basis of the urgent need for railway signalling innovative solutions to\nenhance railway capacity and efficiency. Many passengers are affected by these constraints, and\nthe consequences of not addressing these issues could severely impact the reliability and\nsustainability of Europe's transportation network. This report seeks case studies in various European\ncountries to bridge existing gaps and foster consensus on the future direction of railway signalling\ntechnology deployment, particularly focusing on ETCS HTD, which offers a balanced solution that\ncombines the benefits of modern train control technologies with the practicality and cost-\neffectiveness of using existing infrastructure. This makes it an attractive option for rail operators\nlooking to enhance their systems without incurring the high costs and complexities associated with\nfull-scale replacements or upgrades.\nExisting literature and prior research highlighted the potential benefits and initial successes of\nHL3/HTD. However, significant gaps remains, particularly in real-world applicability and performance\nunder varied conditions. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art of\nERTMS/ETCS, followed by the investigation of various case studies and variables pertaining to the\nHTD design. These variables are the size of the Trackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks, the size of\nthe Virtual Sub Sections (VSS) and the share or types of trains equipped with Train Integrity\nMonitoring (TIM). The scope encompasses various scenarios across fifteen rail lines and networks\nin Europe, namely Spain, France, Sweden and the Netherlands. The case studies vary in terms of\ninfrastructure, traffic, general assumptions and scenarios. In particular, the level of complexity can\nbe different depending on the investigated set of performance indicators and scenarios, as well as\non the market segment. The investigated market segments include high-speed, mainline, regional,\n(sub)urban and freight railways. By collaborating with key stakeholders and industry experts, these\nspecifications will be simulated on CAF tool (for the Spanish cases) and RailSys tool (for the Dutch,\nSwedish and French cases) to model and analyse different performance indicators under various\nscenarios, including traffic and infrastructure conditions.\nThe added value of this deliverable is to check based on these requirements specification in which\ndesign configurations, scenarios, market segments and cases HTD can be mostly beneficial. This\nwould allow to find the scenarios that would significantly reduce headways, allowing for more trains\nto operate safely on the same tracks, thus addressing congestion issues effectively. The findings\nfrom these test specifications will underscore the EU's added value in standardising and supporting\nadvanced rail technologies, promoting a more integrated and efficient European rail network.\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 3 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

Existing\nsignalling systems have been exploited to such an extent that capacity increase by means of\nconventional methods is no longer possible. However, new alternatives that fit the overall European\nobjectives (e.g., to deliver a high-capacity integrated European railway network by eliminating\nbarriers to interoperability, providing solutions for full integration, and achieving faster uptake and\ndeployment of innovation) represent a step ahead to tackle the abovementioned limitation:\nDigitalisation and automation solutions for rail operation (e.g., Automatic Train Operation (ATO) up\nto Grade of Automation (GoA)4, ETCS Hybrid Train Detection and Moving Block and Advanced Safe\nTrain Positioning (ASTP) among others).\nDeliverable D37.3 belongs to FP2 WP37 ‘ETCS HL3 Deployment Strategies’ that aims at developing\nmigration and deployment strategies to accelerate the application of ETCS Hybrid Level 3, currently\nknown as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD), which consequently reap the benefits as quickly as possible\nand avoids costly investments in new infrastructure as much as possible.\n2.1 RELATIONS WITH OTHER FLAGSHIPS, WORK PACKAGES AND DELIVERABLES IN\nEUROPE'S RAIL\nD37.3 relates to FP2 WP15 ‘Hybrid Level 3 Specification’ whose main objective is to align and\nintegrate the HTD approach into the future Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the\nSystem Pillar and to apply the defined principles to different kinds of railways. D37.3 also relates to\npublicly available documents on ETCS HL3 specifications published by the ERTMS Users Group\n(EUG).\nThis deliverable is a main input to FP1 WP8 ‘Development - Simulation and operational feedback for\nimproved planning’ and FP1 WP9 ‘Demonstration - Simulation and operational feedback for\nimproved planning’. FP1 WP8/9 will perform the capacity simulations that align with the requirements\nspecification defined in this deliverable. D37.3 also has dependencies with D37.1 ‘Standardisation\nand deployment’ since the requirements specification are crucial when defining standardisation and\ndeployment. In addition, it relates to D37.2 ‘Methodology for optimised placement of (virtual) blocks’\nsince based on the input that will be received from FP1 WP8/9, the method for optimising the design\nof blocks will be defined. In a further step, the results from D37.2 and from the capacity studies in\nFP1 WP8/9 will be used as input for D37.4 ‘Determining ETCS HL3 capacity impact analysis using\nsimulations’.\n2.2 OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE\nThe main objective of this deliverable is to describe the requirements specification for the capacity\nsimulation studies. In particular, this deliverable aims at providing the performance indicators and\nscenarios to be included in FP1 WP8 and calculated in FP1 WP9 in order to find the right method\nfor applying HTD in several environments and for various market segments. These work packages\nwill perform research on the railway capacity and the number of trains that can be handled, given\nseveral infrastructure designs, timetables and technologies installed on the infrastructure side and\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 11 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

The description of the scenarios therefore focuses on finding the\ndifferent methods for infrastructure design from a railway capacity perspective. This deliverable sets\nthe basis for these work packages, that will also perform part of the research on the robustness of\nthe railway system for disturbances. This will be done with only deterministic delays. Stochastic\ndelays are excluded here, because of the lack of good input data (there are no comparable HTD\nsystems in operation). In addition, the reproduction of a scenario in a stochastic environment and\nthe comparison of the results is more difficult (due to the different propagation of knock-on delays\nbased on input delays).\nThis deliverable focuses on the simulation specifications that will be sent to EU Rail FP1 WP8/9 for\ncalculation and simulation.

ERTMS includes the European Train Control System (ETCS) for\nautomatic train protection, the first baseline of ATO up to GoA2, the Global System for Mobile\nCommunications for Railways (GSM-R) and FRCMS. Improving the safety of national and\ninternational train traffic, bringing benefit in terms of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the entire\nControl Command and Signalling system (CCS), by reducing trackside assets, and increasing\nCapacity are among the most relevant advantages of ERTMS.\nDepending on the application level, ETCS trackside and on-board subsystems are characterized by\nspecific equipment on both the track and the train, their interaction, and their functions. The ETCS\nlevels establish different uses of ERTMS as a train control system [1]:\n\ne ETCS Level 1: track-to-train spot communications, where a significant and costly amount of\ntrackside elements are required to control the movement of the train. Train detection and\ntrain separation are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling\nsystem.\n\ne ETCS Level 2: continuous communications between the train and the track, which enable a\nreduction in OPEX and CAPEX and increase line capacity. Train detection and train\nseparation can be performed by the Radio Block Centre (in cooperation with the train which\nsends position reports and train integrity information) and/or by other trackside equipment.\n\nETCS Level 2 is therefore a crucial player in the search for delivering better capacity, reducing costs,\nimproving flexibility, and increasing reliability of the railway network since dependency on trackside\nequipment is minimized.\nETCS Hybrid Level 3 (HL3), currently known as Hybrid Train Detection (HTD) based on the ERTMS\nUsers Group [2], is one of the ETCS L2 implementations that fulfils these purposes. In the context\nof R2ZDATO, WP37 aims at developing migration and deployment strategies to accelerate the\nimplementation of HTD.\nHTD is a concept that uses pre-configured fixed virtual blocks for the separation of trains. The virtual\nblocks can be used by trains that are able to send integrity confirmation in the position report, while\ntrackside train detection is still used for the separation of trains which are not able to send integrity\nconfirmation. The trackside train detection is also used for the handling of degraded situations. The\nmain advantage of HTD is the reduction of trackside implementation cost (extending current\nTrackside Train Detection (TTD) blocks), an improved capacity performance (by introducing shorter\nblocks), or a combination of both.\n3.1 ETCS HYBRID LEVEL 3/HYBRID TRAIN DETECTION OBJECTIVE\nThe ERTMS Users Group [2] discuss how ETCS HL3/HTD aims at increasing line capacity and\noptimizing the use of existing infrastructure. HTD improves train detection and safety by combining\ntrack-side and on-board systems. In addition, HTD facilitates a smooth transition from conventional\nsystems and ensures compatibility. Therefore, the main goal of HTD is to improve railway system\ncapacity, safety, and efficiency while reducing costs and enhancing operational flexibility.\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 13 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

These features are subject\nto specific application analyses, as the behaviour of the National System is not harmonised.\nThe HTD-ready trains are generally expected to be equipped at least with a system providing the\ntrain integrity information to the EVC (OTI-I) and optionally a system providing the safe train length\n(OTI-L).

This concept is based\non the following essential components/functionalities:\n\ne Positive Train Detection (PTD): PTD relies on information received from the train itself. It\nuses position reports sent by the train, including data such as position, integrity status, and\nsafe train length. When a train reports “integrity confirmed,” it becomes an “integer train”. The\ntrackside can use this information to determine the train’s location and manage train\nmovements. PTD allows for reduced trackside infrastructure since it does not rely solely on\nphysical sensors (such as track circuits or axle counters).\n\ne Trackside Train Detection (TTD): TTD is the conventional method of train detection using\nphysical sensors installed along the track (e.g., track circuits or axle counters). In the HTD\nsystem, the TTD sections are subdivided into smaller units called Virtual Sub-Sections\n(VSSs). Each VSS corresponds to a portion of the TTD section and has its own occupation\nstatus (free, occupied, ambiguous or unknown). TTD information can confirm whether a train\nis or not physically present on a VSS.\n\ne Virtual Sub-Sections (VSS): VSSs are the building blocks of the HTD system. They allow for\nfiner granularity in train separation. Each VSS can be in one of four states (based on trackside\ninformation):\n\no Free: No train is located on the VSS.\n\no Occupied: An integer train is present on the VSS, and no other vehicle is behind it.\n\no Ambiguous: A train is present, but there might be another non-connected vehicle\nbehind it.\n\no Unknown: No train is confirmed on the VSS, but its status is uncertain.\n\nVSS states are dynamically updated by means of a VSS state machine, which is operated\nbased mainly on position reports, TTD information, the status of the HTD timers and\nMovement Authority (MA) information.\n\ne Train Location: The concept of “train location” defines the trackside view of the portion of\ntrack currently occupied by a connected train. The front end of the train location is determined\nby the train’s max safe front end position and train detection information. According to the\nEUG document on the HTD Principles (published on 16 July 2024), the front end of the train\nlocation is not depending on the integrity status. The train integrity is based on the rear end\nof the train location which is \"established\" for a train treated as integer or \"assumed\" for a\ntrain which is not treated as an integer [2]. Therefore, the rear end of the train location is\neither “established rear end” (for integer trains) or “assumed rear end” (for non-integer trains).\n\ne HTD timers: For handling degraded situations, there are two types of timers defined within\nthe HTD concept:\n\no Waiting timers: they are aimed to avoid unnecessary changes in the state of a VSS\ndue to the asynchronicity of train position, train integrity and TTD information. They\nare:\n\n= Mute timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider after a\ndefined time that the communication with that train is lost;\n\n« Wait integrity timer: used at the trackside for each connected train to consider\nafter a defined time that the integrity of that train is lost when no integrity\ninformation is available;\n\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 15 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

In particular, in section 4.1 we present the performance indicators for the capacity simulation\nstudies. In 4.2 we define the set-up of scenarios and variables, followed by the description of the\nsimulation environments CAF tool and RailSys in 4.3.\n4.1 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nThere are several performance indicators to be assessed after executing the simulations. Together,\nthese performance indicators will provide a complete overview of the effects of ERTMS HL3/HTD\nregarding capacity. These relate to the general terms of capacity and robustness. The capacity will\nbe assessed in simulations without external delays and the robustness in simulations with external\ndelays (compared to the undelayed simulation). Both require different performance indicators that\nare elaborated in Table 1 and Table 2.\nThe definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios without external delays are explained in\nTable 1.\nTable 1: Capacity-related performance indicators for scenarios without external delays\nPerformance Explanation\nindicator\nHeadway Minutes Minimal time between 2 trains with | In simulations that only\nand which the second can follow the first | consider 2 trains at the\nseconds on the whole trajectory just without | same time (Spanish, French\nhindrance. and Swedish case studies).\nRelative % Timetable compression method | In simulations that consider\ncapacity (capacity | according to UIC-406 leaflet, to be | a complete timetable\nutilisation utilistation | performed on one corridor at a time | (French, Swedish and\n/60 min) | without merging traffic.

This gives the insight in how quickly the block layout given a particular traffic pattern helps\nto solve the congestion. The definitions of the performance indicators for scenarios with external\ndelays are explained in Table 2.\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 17 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

Only research\nrelated to capacity and robustness will be the focus of these case studies as stated in Section 4.1.\nFor capacity, the headway between two following trains will be computed or the relative capacity\nutilisation of a full timetable will be calculated. For robustness calculations, some scenarios will be\nset up in which a train blocks the corridor for a set time period, where the aim is to study the recovery\ntime, number of affected trains and total delay.\nSimulation with stochastic disruptions will not be included in this stage, for several reasons. The\ninput data of real disruptions is not available for future or hypothetical situations analysis, scenarios\nare harder to reproduce or compare and finally this method requires many runs which makes\nsimulation and analysis more time consuming. Overcoming these issues does not outweigh the\nbenefits, so stochastic analysis is not foreseen in this deliverable. Therefore, all simulations will be\ndeterministic with no delays or fixed delays in the simulation.\nIn every scenario, we define a reference situation, using the current or future base information about\nthe track and calculating the headway or relative capacity utilisation. After that, and through\nvariations of the physical blocks and incorporating virtual blocks, according to what is proposed in\neach scenario, improvement in capacity will be sought in these cases where the capacity is the main\nobjective. When the objective is cost reduction and only keeping equal capacity, we look for keeping\nthe current headway but changing the physical blocks into VSSs.\nThese results are used not only in this work package in tasks T37.3 and T37.5, but also in FP2\nWP32.\nEach case study described in Chapter 5 includes four parts:\ne Infrastructure: a description of the part of the railway network used in the case studies, either\nthe current infrastructure for existing lines or the planned infrastructure for a greenfield situation.\ne Traffic: a description of the train services on the delimited network and possible alterations that\ncould influence the scenario.

They always relate\nto reference scenario and then build up in order to make the results comparable with only one\nvariable changed at a time. The variables are described below.\n\nFor our simulation studies of HTD there are three variables of interest: the lengths of the TTD blocks,\nthe lengths of the VSSs and the availability of TIMs on trains. These variables are defined for each\nscenario and depend on the state and aim of each network.\n\ne Size of the TTD blocks [m]: A benefit with HTD is the possibility to extend the current TTDs\nwithout affecting capacity negatively. This means that for some scenarios varying the size of\nTTD is of interest.\n\ne Size of the VSS [m]: For creating additional capacity with additional blocks it is not necessary\nanymore to add axle counters or loops, but it can be done with adding VSSs. Therefore the\nsize of VSSs is crucial for the capacity computation.\n\ne Share of trains equipped with TIM [% or based on train type]: The availability of TIM equipped\ntrains in the traffic pattern has impact on the capacity and robustness. This might be a\npercentage of the trains or defined as one train category to have a TIM and another to not have\na TIM.\n\n4.3 SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS\n\nTwo simulation environments will be used in EU Rail FP1 WP9 for assessing the case studies of this\nwork package: the tool of CAF for exploratory research based on the headway of two trains for the\nSpanish case studies and RailSys for the French, Swedish and Dutch case studies that involve a\ncomplete timetable and in some cases external delays. Both simulation environments are briefly\ndescribed in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2.\n\n4.3.1 CAF tool\n\nThe simulations for the Spanish cases will be performed in the CAF tool. It is focussed on calculating\nheadways. Therefore the tool needs information about the rolling stock and about the technical and\nthe physical characteristics of the track. The tool is limited to work with two trains at the same time:\nthe predecessor and its follower. According to this information, it offers the headway between them\nas a solution.\n\n4.3.2 RailSys\n\nThe simulation software RailSys is an integrated microscopic planning tool, developed by RMCon.\nRailSys is widely used in the railway sector by infrastructure managers, railway undertakings\nconsulting firms and research institutes [4].

Infrastructure and rolling stock are modelled on a\nmicroscopic level, which provides sufficiently detailed settings for the modelling of HTD and\nanalytical possibilities for the results.\nInfrastructure models are needed for all scenarios which utilise RailSys. In case of current lines,\nexisting models will be used as a basis of the studies. For some scenarios, ERTMS/ETCS will need\nto be implemented in the models. HTD needs to be designed and applied to all existing models for\nthe relevant scenarios. It is important that relevant settings are correctly used to achieve a credible\nsimulation result. Coordination between partners is necessary for this purpose.\nFor the evaluation of capacity utilisation, the UlIC-406 compression method in RailSys will be used.\nIn RailSys, the interpretation of UIC-406 is based on the compression of sequential timetable train\npaths within divided sections [4]. According to the method, RailSys identifies conflicts in the timetable\nand moves affected trains exactly unhindered behind the conflicting train. The outcome from the\nRailSys computation is the capacity utilisation which will be generated from specific case studies as\ndescribed in Chapter 5.\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 20 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

The timetable for\nthe Atocha commuter lines can be found in [6]. The maximum speed of the trains is 90 km/h.\n5.1.3 General assumptions\nAll the trains are equipped with TIMs in the reference scenario.\nTIMs conditions are changed for the rest of the simulations as explained in the following section.\n5.1.4 Scenarios\nFor the scenarios to be simulated in this section, two objectives are pursued. On the one hand, the\naim is to achieve an increase in capacity; on the other hand, the aim is to reduce costs. Considering\nthe following described conditions, the goal is to find a balance between both, cost and capacity.\nIn order to achieve these objectives, different scenarios are proposed to check, by simulation, if,\nfirstly, the defined goals are achieved and, secondly, if the results are valid.\nFirst, the reference scenario is defined, which is the current track and traffic status, and will be used\nto compare the rest of the scenarios to be simulated. In this way, we will obtain an answer on whether\nwe have improved the defined goals regarding the current state.\nThese scenarios are determined by modifying different elements: making changes in the\ninfrastructure (TTD), modifying the integrity of the rolling stock and incorporating VSSs.\nSince the objectives to be achieved for this line are both capacity improvement and cost reduction,\nthe chosen scenarios are the following:\nIn relation to traffic and rolling stock, two alternative conditions are defined: the first is that it is\nassumed that commuter trains are equipped with TIMs, whereas regional trains are not equipped\nwith it (Scenarios 1 and 2 in Table 4). The second condition is to consider that all the trains are\nequipped with TIMs (Scenarios 3 and 4 Table 4). This way, differences regarding capacity between\nthose cases can be compared, where it could be visualized whether a decrease in capacity is\nobtained as a result when not having TIMs equipped.\nRegarding TTDs, in the first scenario, the current TTD layout remains with no change. As mentioned,\nthe cost reduction goal is also pursued, therefore, a case where TTDs are reduced between stations\nto the minimum is defined. By reducing the number of physical TTDs, a cost reduction could be\nobtained as a result of not installing them when designing a track.\nHowever, if we only reduce the TTDs, this could be reflected in a decrease in capacity, hence, VSSs\nare incorporated. For the length of these, a methodology for optimal VSS lengths for each specific\nline should be followed.\nHowever, in the absence of such methodology, it is intended to make an engineering study of the\nline, where the most critical sections of the track will be identified and analyzed. Firstly, a maximum\nVSS length (taking into account the TTD maximum size) is implemented, then, a simulation is runned\nand a new VSS size decreased by multiples of 25 is simulated. Several iterations are performed\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 25 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

The reason is that capacity and robustness are important\naspects of this line, as the capacity utilization is high, and the line is prone to disturbances. The\nsignalling system ETCS L2 is used as benchmark, as there is an ongoing project to implement\nERTMS on the line.\nThe traffic scenarios have been chosen from the assumption that different train types will be\nupgraded with train integrity in steps, from easy implementation to complex. For this reason, it is\nassumed that railcars will have working train integrity in a first step, followed by locomotive-hauled\npassenger, and lastly freight trains. The value for VSS lengths in this case study should be from the\nassumption of a simple deployment strategy. Meaning, that the VSS lengths have a standardized\nlength. This is mainly because of two reasons: firstly, it simplifies the simulations in this first step of\nstudying the deployment strategies; secondly, studying the effect of a standardized length could be\nof interest as it would save cost for the HTD deployment project. A standardized VSS length, in this\nstep, should be in the range of 200 — 500 meters. The reason for this is that similar values have been\nused in earlier studies [12].\nThe total number of scenarios to be simulated for the Swedish Southern mainline is 16 (four train\nintegrity scenarios per infrastructure scenario).

The base infrastructure on which a Level 2 design from the real project according to design\nversion 2.0 of February 2024. This is infra scenario I-0.\n\n2. The first HTD design, numbered I-1, is based on the base L2 design of Il-0 and assumes a\nheadway of approximately 1 minute without buffer times still reachable on the TTD for\ndegraded situations and behind trains without TIM. This leads to a reduction of 50 % axle\ncounters as a result of the following assumptions:\n\ne Physical blocks of ~ 2 km on tracks without regular freight traffic, given passenger\ntrains running at 140 km/h\n\ne Physical blocks of 0,5 — 1 km on tracks with regular freight traffic, given freight trains\nrunning at 100 km/h\n\ne Some shorter physical blocks near stations\n\ne No additional virtual blocks\n\n3. The second HTD-design, numbered I-4, is the base infrastructure with only a minimum\nnumber of axle counters, always near other physical objects (switches and level crossings).\n\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 52 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

In Figure 17, the line plan is\ndescribed. Between Schiphol and Lelystad, and between Schiphol and Hilversum, an intercity\nservice runs every 15 minutes. Furthermore, there are 6 Sprinters an hour between Almere and\nAmsterdam Centraal, 4 Sprinters between Hilversum and Amsterdam Centraal and 2 Sprinters\nbetween Hilversum and Almere. Finally, 4 Sprinter trains run from Amsterdam Zuid to Lelystad that\ndo not stop at local stations between Weesp and Lelystad.\nFreight paths are also part of this corridor and run twice every hour between Amsterdam Bijlmer and\nHilversum. International paths are part of regular intercity traffic on this corridor. One of the four\nintercities to Lelystad runs from Brussels, and one of the intercities to Amersfoort continues to Berlin.\nIn this study, these trains are considered as regular national intercities.\nThe intercities run in a strict 15-minute interval, while all other trains are evenly divided in this interval.\nThis leads to multiple short headways. Between Schiphol and Amsterdam Zuid a train runs every\n2.5 - 3 minutes without exception. The most restricting part of the OV-SAAL network is between\nWeesp and Almere. This time-distance diagram is visualized in Figure 18, in which the intercities are\nshown in blue. The local trains from Amsterdam Zuid run non-stop between Weesp and Almere.\nTogether with all Sprinters, the structure is described from Weesp to Almere as follows: Intercity,\nlocal train from Amsterdam Centraal, local train from Amsterdam Zuid, local train from Amsterdam\nCentraal or Hilversum, Intercity. Almost all headways on Weesp and Almere are planned at 2.5\nminutes.\n: SSE SRS 本 SAAL model It 2030 in\na || landelijke 6basis uitwerking\nASDL . 。 | 和 3 ze 2 8\nev Et\non | 国王二 5iE a\na , fi INC il\n, Fels.

All\nof these are used to increase the applicability for the Dutch system.\nThe rolling stocks we use for passenger trains are ICNG-13 (Intercity Nieuwe Generatie) for all\nintercities in Flevoland and Hilversum, and SNG-10 (Sprinter Nieuwe Generatie) for all local trains\nand express trains.\nRunning time supplements are applied in the timetable, and therefore need to be incorporated in the\nsimulation as well. The running time supplement is described as a percentage of the technical\nrunning time. The OV-SAAL timetable uses 7% for all intercities, and 6% for all local trains and\nexpress trains.\nA buffer time of 60 seconds is applied to all passenger trains. This practically means that every\nsection is occupied 60 seconds after a train has left that specific section. We use this method on all\nscenarios. This value is used in order to have an additional buffer between two trains in the timetable\nfor the purpose of robustness, when they have to occupy the same infrastructure shortly behind each\nother.\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 57 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",

These trains have a length of 720 metres, carry 2400 tonnes and are propelled by one\n\nBR189. Freight trains do not run with a running time supplement and do not use a buffer time.\n\nWe consider two types of dwell time. The first is the dwell time at small stations. On these, local\n\ntrains will dwell for 30 seconds and intercities dwell for 54 seconds. Those are the technical minimum\n\ndwell time based both on realisation data and proces analysis of the dwell procedure. On larger\n\nstations, a larger value is used based on both realisation data and robustness measures. We use a\n\nlist made by ProRail that includes all intercity stations and differs for Sprinters and Intercities.\n\n5.13.4 Scenarios\n\nWe propose 7 timetable scenarios numbered with “T-” to assess the impact on capacity and\n\nrobustness. The scenarios outlined in Table 19 are based on the areas to simulate specified in Table\n\n18. Scenarios T-1 and T-3 are analysed for both the SAAL corridor and the Flevo Line, whereas T-\n\n2 is analysed exclusively for SAAL. Scenarios T-4, T-5, T-6, and T-7 are analysed solely for the\n\nFlevo Line. The combination of the infrastructure scenarios and timetable scenarios lead to 31\n\ncombinations as depicted in Table 19.

The methodology, case studies and scenarios\nhave been reviewed by partners from EU Rail FP1 WP8, that are now making preparations to\nexecute the required scenarios for WP9.\nThe scenarios are provided for seven Spanish case studies, two case studies in France, three in\nSweden and one in the Netherlands. The Spanish cases cover all five market segments: high-speed,\nmainline (mixed traffic), (sub-)urban, regional and freight. They are exploratory of the headway\nperformance indicator. The insights can be used further in the French, Swedish and Dutch cases,\nthat cover the high-speed, mainline (mixed traffic) and (sub-)urban market segments. They use also\nrelative capacity utilisation as a measure in order to evaluate the capacity from a line and network\nperspective. Finally, two cases from Sweden (Southern mainline) and the Netherlands (SAAL-\ncorridor) will be used to evaluate HTD-designs for their robustness by adding a deterministic delay\nto a single train. This is measured by the performance indicators: recovery time, number of affected\ntrains and total delay in the system.\nThe scenarios are built specifically around logical combinations of infrastructure and traffic. In the\ninfrastructure, the variance lies in the number and positioning of trackside train detection and the\nvirtual subsections in between. In the traffic the variance is possible in the share and types of trains\nthat are equipped to fully utilise HTD by having a Train Integrity Monitor on board.\nThe results of the calculations of EU Rail FP1 WP9 will be used in the development and evaluation\nof the method for track layout with ETCS HTD, that will be described in deliverable 37.2 of this work\npackage. Another evaluation of the results will be performed in EU Rail FP2 WP32, where different\nDATO-concepts are compared.\nR2D-WP37-D-PRO-001-03 Page 59 of 60 20/12/2024\nInterne",
