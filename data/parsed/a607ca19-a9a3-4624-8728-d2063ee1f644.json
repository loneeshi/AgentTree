This push is geared towards enhancing\ncapacity and reliability in rail operations.\nIn this context, the R2Z2DATO project aims to revolutionize the European railway infrastructure through\ndigitalization and automation, leading up to autonomous train operations.\nThe surge in automation and digitization necessitates a parallel increase in data generation and\nutilization within the rail system. Particularly with regards to fully automated driving (referred to as\nautomation level 4, or GoA4), the integration of sensors and cameras is crucial for automatic\nresponse to hazards in the rail environment through artificial intelligence (Al). Developing Al software\nfor environmental perception, for instance, demands vast amounts of high-quality data. However, it's\nevident that individual rail entities may struggle to amass sufficient sensor data for adequately\ntraining Al systems for fully automated rail operations.\nThere is therefore a growing consensus that a Data Factory is essential - an ecosystem that enables\nsensor data to be collected, simulated, processed and shared, as well as Al-models to be generated,\ncertified and implemented in automated rail operations.\noo <2) Developers &\nQe P| ( ») 1010 & cS “图\n9.5, kJ) —)) FE Segre | a\n~~ | mn” 一 Data 4 办一\nGe 一 | 一 1 ys en],\nAcquire Transfer Store, Process, Simulate, ML, Provide\nAnnotation pate 3}\nLoog <\n<>\naes for > > eo\n= 9} = ig? = * = ipetines ,\n<< 居中 SEY) Yee BS eee ee\n= = C) () = = () Be = = ( ) ER (\nSensor Sensor Storage & Storage & Dataselection High Perf.

This further sharpened\nthe picture of the target functionalities and system and subsystem architectures were derived.\nThis document presents the target configuration of the Data Factory and contains the system and\nsubsystem requirements, as well as the requirements for data quality, annotations and security.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 4 of 213 17/12/2024",

The basic functionalities, which will be discussed in\nmore detail later in the document, are described in italics. The physical IT assets and the data are\nshown in black and the toolchain with the most important platform functionalities is shown in blue.\nVehicle Data Logger: At the vanguard of data acquisition, the Vehicle Data Logger is a designated\nto record onboard data on trains, capturing sensor data and crucial operational metrics and to\ntransfer the data manually or wirelessly to the track-side (Figure 2 and sections 2.5.1, 2.5.5, 2.7.10).\nData Touchpoint: Strategically placed Data Touchpoints are used for the automatic, wireless and\nsecure transfer of data from the Vehicle to the Data Centre (see Figure 3 and section 2.7.3). The\nTouchpoints also perform data processing and prioritisation so that only data of high quality and\nimportance needs to be transmitted.\n£ f amu ff a Q Ree eel | | !\n=' ——— 1 i. 4 , o =a 攻 eee] i\n| 4 a : “ SN a 4 {a i = = ae =)\n1 Ws nN : aia a | = ne os\nFigure 2: Vehicle Data Figure 3: Data Touch- Figure 4: Data Factory HPC infrastructure at DB InfraGO\nLogger at DB InfraGO point at DB InfraGO Data Centre\nData Center with HPC infrastructure and Toolchain: This part of the Data Factory forms the core\nof functionalities to aggregate, process and store huge amounts of data.

Key components such as sensor\ndata acquisition with a Vehicle Data Logger, Data Touchpoints, edge components and IT assets in\nthe Data Centre as well as a uniform toolchain are to be designed in such a way that they form a\nuniform platform overall.\n\nThis platform should in turn be integrated into the concept of the Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF)\n[5][15], in which individual Data Factories or individual IT assets of the members are connected to\neach other, realised with a high-speed backbone network [8] and implemented by defining common\ndata standards and interfaces. In the vision, the final expansion stage will comprise a uniform and\nshared toolchain.\n\nThis merger is intended to achieve synergy effects that will enable to master the complex tasks of\ngenerating permissible Al functions for automated train operation in accordance with GoA4.\nRecommendations for the Future: Building on Deliverable 7.1 as a basis, the Data Factory should\nbe further developed and gradually integrated into the PEDF as described in [13] and [14]. It must\nbe ensured that the Data Factory remains adaptable and compatible with various railroad systems\nand third-party technologies.\n\nIn summary, Report 7.1 is a testament to the collaborative efforts undertaken within the RZ2DATO\nproject to create a data-centric future for rail transportation. It serves as a strategic dossier for the\nsuccessful creation of a data and Al platform for the implementation of functions for GoA4 automated\ntrain operation.\n\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 6 of 213 17/12/2024",

Specifically,\nthis deliverable fits within the framework of the Technology Demonstrator (TD) and Work Area (WA)\ncorresponding to Information Technology Solutions for Train Operation.\nThe R2DATO project contributes to the broader Shift2Rail objectives by targeting advancements in\nrail system automation, pushing forward the boundaries toward fully autonomous train operations.\nThe work detailed herein contributes to the accomplishment of key objectives set out for TD/WA on\nNext-Generation Train Control and Communication Systems, achieving a Technology Readiness\nLevel (TRL) that demonstrates a significant step forward from the conceptual stage to the system\nprototyping in operational environments.\nBackground and Project Contribution: The rail industry is at a pivotal junction, with digitalization\npromising to redefine the performance, reliability, and safety standards of rail operations. Within this\nevolutionary path, the R2DATO project stands out with its specific contribution to the Shift2Rail\nprogram. It aims to leverage data-driven methodologies to enhance the control, monitoring, and\npredictive capabilities of European rail operations.\nObjectives and Aim of this Deliverable: The primary objective of this deliverable is to outline the\nrequirements and specifications of a Data Factory and the data itself. The data serves as backbone\nfor analytics and machine learning to develop Al functions for GoA4 automated train operation\n(ATO). The Data Factory, particularly in combination with the concept of the Pan-European Data\nFactory (PEDF) is envisioned as a central hub for collecting and storing huge amount of data for\nMachine Learning tasks, supporting the Shift2Rail's goals of increasing efficiency and advancing\ntoward autonomous train operation.\nMotivation: The setup of the Data Factory is motivated by the need to develop fully automated\ndriving with Al-functionalities for environment perception, incidence management, localization and\nother functionalities.\nTo achieve this, huge amounts of data needs to be collected, transferred, processed an annotated,\nalso synthetic data needs to be simulated to generate data of rare railway scenarios. With this data\nmachine learning is performed to train Al-models and the data also serves for the evaluation and\ntesting. At the end of the process a platform is needed for certification and homologation of these\nfunctions (see Figure 5).\n\n> Huge amounts of data needed for Machine Learning (ML) and Homologation €\nEPO Hybrid Cloud\n0: xX 一 力 () i [fess bef Haréware in the Loop\n~ Ge D_ 八国 CY Multi tenant Access\nAe foooe | ———>} ee | CS a A) Pan-European Network\nVehicle Data Data Center °\nTouchpoint\n\nFigure 5: Motivation for a Data Factory\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 21 of 213 17/12/2024",

In the future, this platform will also stream data to HiL test stands and will provide data\nand tools for certification.\nThe goals of WP7 Data Factory are:\ne D7.1: Development of the Data Factory specifications that is compatible with the PEDF\nconcept and the ongoing expansion of the infrastructure\ne D7.2: Legal assessment of the Data Factory\ne D/7.3: Joint simulation of scenarios and production of synthetic sensor data\ne D/7.4: Joint collection and annotation of sensor data\ne D7.5: Generation of sensor-based object detectors for perception using machine learning\ne D7.6: Provision of an Open-Data-Set consisting of real sensor data of the railway\nenvironment, associated annotations, simulated synthetic data and digital map data\nThe Data Factory has to be designed in such a way that it can collect and process data from up to\n27 countries with different boundary conditions and rules. We assume that only some RUs, IMs and\nrail suppliers will set up a fully developed Data Factory based on the specifications provided here.\nSome stakeholders will probably only implement partial aspects or use the services of another\nstakeholder's data factory.\nIt must also be ensured that existing and planned Data Factories can be linked together in the future\nto form a Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF) [4], similar to GaiaX CartenaX [21].\nWe also assume that once the Al models have reached a certain level of quality, the amount of data\nto be collected will decrease over the years.\nThe goal of the task 7.1 is to collect the requirements and specifications for the Data Factory\ninfrastructure and the toolchain for the purpose of data simulation, engineering, and ML/AI model\ntraining for GoA3/4 operation. Also, the specifications on the data itself and a sector-wide data\nownership model towards the release of an Open-Data-Set will be carried out.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 24 of 213 17/12/2024",

Also, the\nWP within R2Dato was considered.\n2.3.1 X2Rail4\nX2Rail-4, part of the Shift2Rail initiative, is focused on developing advanced signalling and\nautomation systems for railways, including specifications for Grade of Automation 3/4 (GoA3/4). This\nproject is crucial for integrating Machine Learning (ML) outcomes from data factories into the train's\nperception systems. While train-internal perception systems are outside this Work Package's scope,\nthe alignment of ML results with X2Rail-4's architecture is essential for seamless integration and\noperational efficiency in railway systems. [17]\nX2Rail4 delivers the specifications concerning GoA3/4. Results of the Data Factory ML training must\nfit to the architecture mentioned there.\nAssumptions:\n\ne X2Rail-4 is tasked with developing specifications for Grades of Automation 3 and 4 (GoA3/4)\nto guide the architecture of train perception systems.\n\ne The results from the Data Factory's machine learning (ML) processes are expected to align\nwith X2Rail-4's architectural specifications to ensure system compatibility and integration.\n\nBoundaries:\n\ne The project does not include vehicle internal perception systems within its Work Package\n(WP), delineating the scope of X2Rail-4's responsibilities.\n\ne Clear interfaces and logical infrastructure alignment with X2Rail-4's standards are\nmandatory, even though direct involvement with vehicle internal perception systems is\noutside the project's direct scope.\n\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 26 of 213 17/12/2024",

However, this requires\nthe collection of large amounts of sensor data for Al training - a task that can be challenging for\nindividual railroads or suppliers. To tackle this problem, the concept of a pan-European Rail Data\nFactory has proven to be a promising solution. The CEF2 RailDataFactory study [4], envisioned as\na collaborative infrastructure and partner ecosystem, offers a way forward for RUs, IMs and railway\nsuppliers.\nThis study was carried out and successfully completed in 2023 as a joint effort between DB, SNCF\nand NS. Co-funded by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HADEA), the study\nexamined various aspects, including technical, operational, commercial, legal and strategic\nconsiderations.\nThe Pan-European Railway Data Factory (PEDF) is conceptualized as a collaborative infrastructure\nand ecosystem that integrates data from various sources to enable fully automated train operation\nacross Europe [5] by creating a shared infrastructure for extensive sensor data collection, processing\nand Al development.\n=\nData Factory J «|\n-PanEuropean |\nrae (Railway) Data Factory ~,\n| __ Digital Schiene Deutschland (DSD)__ ey. |\nIf Sensors Data Factory S\\N / Another PEDF member's...\npi ontrains DsD f Data Factory ‘a\n| welts pal - ! | Cat Bl iw |\nVi , Data 号 + Railwa 下\n1 5辆 ‘8 | | = = cat 7\n: Other twackside _ com | 3 chy A |\nsensor data Data Centre Other uackside data !\nFigure 7: Pan-European Data Factory (PEDF) as union of many individual Data Factories\nFigure 7 shows the PEDF as an interconnection and association of several individual data factories\nor individual IT assets that are to be connected via a high-speed backbone network [8]. The individual\nData Factories that are part of the PEDF can exist in different expansion stages.\nWhat is important, however, is the definition of common data standards and interfaces, as well as\nthe prospective creation of a uniform common toolchain. The basic idea of the PEDF is that each\nmember retains sovereignty over its data because the (private) data does not flow out of the\nrespective Data Factory. However, the members can use the partners’ data to conduct data analyses\nor train and evaluate Al models using the uniform toolchain. This construction is similar to GaiaX\nCartenaX, see section 2.3.5 and [21].\nThe strategy for building the PEDF is divided into short, mid and long-term time periods as shown in\nFigure 8. Initially, each stakeholder, whether RU, IM or railway supplier, has its own proprietary\nsolutions. But in the mid-term, the first common standards for data and interfaces should help to\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 29 of 213 17/12/2024",

Therefore, the DB InfraGO AG,\nwithin the sector initiative Digitale Schiene Deutschland (DSD), and the German Centre for Rail\nTransport Research (DZSF) at the Federal Railway Authority (EBA) have created the first publicly\navailable multi-sensor data set, i.e. Open Sensor Data for Rail (OSDaR23) [1][2]. The sensor dataset\nannotated as part of the project was recorded in several data collection runs in Hamburg by DSD.\nThe dataset contains regular railroad environments and scenes from regular operating as well as\nsome special situations and objects (like flames and smoke), which were posed.\nOSDaR23 is a manually annotated open dataset with a multi-sensor setup for the railway\nenvironment. The multi-sensor setup includes 3 high resolution cameras, 3 medium resolution\ncameras, 3 infrared cameras, 3 long-range LiIDARs, 1 mid-range Lidar, 2 short-range LiDARs, 1\nlong-range radar, 4 inertial measurement units, 4 GPS/GNSS sensors, which are usually at the front\nof the train.

The three color cameras (RGB) cover a total horizontal field-of-view (FOV) of 70°, whereby\nthe FOVs between two color cameras overlap by 10°. The three infrared cameras each have a long\nfocal length and cover a total horizontal FOV of 30°, with the FOVs of the second infrared camera\noverlapping by 1°. The medium-resolution, high-resolution and infrared camera have a respective\nresolution of 5, 12 and 1.2 megapixel.\nThe lidar modality comprises 3 long-range lidars, 1 mid-range lidar and 2 corner lidars. The three\nlong-range lidars cover a total horizontal FOX of 16°, with the FOVs of two lidars overlapping by 2°.\nThe mid-range lidar has a horizontal FOV of approximately 180°. The corner lidars are mounted in\nsuch a way that the FOV also extends to the rear and each corner lidar thus covers approximately\n270°, whereby the entire area in front of the vehicle is covered equally by both lidars. The total\nresolution of all Lidars in the setup is a maximum of 240.000 points per frame.\nThe radar modality consists of a long-range radar, which has a horizontal FOV of 180°, a range\nresolution of approximately 18cm and a maximum detection range of 500 meters.\nThe gas sensor modality has 2 sensors, 1 gas and 1 particle sensor. The gas sensor detects the\nconcentration of CO2 in air by absorption spectroscopy and the particle sensor detects the\nconcentration of five different particle sizes in air between 0.5 - 10 um in diameter.\nThe localization modality records the horizontal localization information or position via GNSS satellite\npositioning, as well as gyroscope and acceleration information via IMU.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 33 of 213 17/12/2024",

Ontology is composed of Capability Metadata and Entity\nMetadata.\n2.5.2.2 Ontology Characteristics\nA ontology is a formal representation and must have some structured form and hast to be machine\nreadable. The ontology is an explicit description of a domain and is not like a natural language text\ndescription but is an enumeration of the entities that belong to this domain and how they relate to\neach other.\n2.5.2.3 RDF and OQL Ontology Format\nThe Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard\noriginally designed as a data model for metadata.

RDF provides a variety of syntax notations and data\nserialization formats, with Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) currently being the most widely used\nnotation.\nThe W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a Semantic Web language designed to represent rich\nand complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things. OWL is a\ncomputational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL can be exploited by\ncomputer programs, e.g., to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge\nexplicit. OWL documents, known as ontologies, can be published in the World Wide Web and may\nrefer to or be referred from other OWL ontologies.\n2.5.2.4 Generation of Data Factory Sensor Ontologies\nFrom the sensor data described in section 2.5.1 in total 37 ontologies were created for the cameras\n(camera, infrared camera and 5G camera), Lidars, Localization sensors (GNSS and IMU), Gas-\nParticle sensors and diagnosis data (Robot). Figure 12 shows the five steps how to derive a graphical\nrepresentation of the Ontology RDF model from the sensor data.

In order to provide sensor data in a sufficient quality, the incoming sensor data already\nneed to fulfil a set of quality criteria. These criteria can only be satisfied by the onboard system that\nproduces the sensor data. The following Data Quality Requirements are therefore targeting the\nonboard system that generates the sensor data and refer to it as the system under consideration\n(SuC). The requirements are structured thematically, starting with the requirement targeting the\nsensor configuration. These requirements ensure that the configuration of the onboard system with\nits sensors is known for each point in time. The second section about data integrity ensures the\nintegrity of the sensor data in the whole chain from the sensors to the Data Factory. That means that\nthe sensor data is not being modified or corrupted while being stored or transferred. The data content\nsection assures that all available sensor information is attached to the sensor data. The next three\nsections target the multi-modal use of the sensor data and allows the synchronisation of multiple\nmodalities. This includes requirements regarding time stamping, frequency and calibration of the\nsensor data. The last two section target the ego-motion of the train. The GNSS and IMU information\nsection defines the required information to determine the position and motion of the train. The ego\nmotion compensation section defines requirements that allow to correct or minimize artefacts in the\nsensor data that are introduced by the motion of the train during the acquisition of sensor data.\n2.5.5.1 Sensor Configuration\n\ne The SuC shall provide the sensor data in the Highest_Quality that is technically possible\n\nwithout violating the system's performance requirements.\n\no Rationale: The data shall be used for the development of GoA4 train operation. One\nof the main use cases is the environmental perception with its multiple tasks. In order\nto fulfil the requirements of these tasks, an overall high data quality is required. A goal\nis the creation of multi-modal sensor datasets. This requires highly synchronised\nsensor data with a precise calibration and sensor data that allows to detect and\nrecognise objects as good as possible.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the sensor configuration and parameters for each Sensor_Frame.\n\no Rationale: The sensor configuration and parameters shall be provided so that each\nSensor Frame can be associated with the respective sensor's configuration and\nparameters. This is required in order to be able to evaluate sensor configurations and\ncompare different configuration. In addition, it helps to evaluate artefacts in the sensor\ndata based on the configuration. For example, the rolling shutter effects depends on\nthe exposure time. In order to track down errors, the serial numbers and software\nversions need to be known.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the Hardware_Configuration for each Sensor_Frame.\n\no Rationale: Knowing the hardware configuration of the system is essential to detect\nmisconfigured or faulty hardware components. Especially for the hardware\nconfiguration it is not necessary to physically attach it to each Sensor_Framebut\ninstead make transparent which Sensor_Frame are recorded with which hardware.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the Software_Versions for each Sensor Frame.\n\no Rationale: Knowing the software version of each software component in the system\n\nis necessary to track down issues in specific versions of the software that are detected\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 43 of 213 17/12/2024",

Similar to the hardware version it is\nnot necessary to physically attach the software versions to each Sensor_Frame but\ninstead make transparent which Sensor Frame are recorded with which software\nversions.\ne The SuC shall provide the Sensor_Parameters for each Sensor Frame.\n\no Rationale: Knowing the sensor parameters for each Sensor_Frameis necessary to\ncompare the sensor parameters at different environment conditions and evaluate the\neffects of different sensor parameters on the data quality. For example, the exposure\ntime can influence the rolling shutter artefacts of a camera.\n\n2.5.5.2 Data Integrity\ne The SuC shall provide the unmodified Sensor Data_Streams to the Data_Logger for\nrecording.\n\no Rationale: The Sensor Frame shall not be modified by any subsystem in order to\navoid that other systems only having data in reduced quality. For certification of the\nsystem it is necessary to ensure that the data is not being modified. This includes that\nall Sensor_Frame are forwarded to the Data_Logger and no information is removed\nfrom the data.\n\ne The SuC shall publish the Acquisition. Timestamp that is provided by the sensor.\n\no Rationale: The goal is to know the acquisition timestamp when the Sensor _Frame is\nphysically being captured by the sensor. This requires to have a _ precisely\nsynchronised sensor and that the timestamp provided by the sensor is not overridden\nwith the timestamp when the sensor arrives at the driver or any other subsystem.\n\ne The SuC shall allow to verify the authenticity and integrity of each Sensor_Frame.\n\no Rationale: It shall be possible to verify that the message is not being modified. This\nverification shall be possible at each stage in the system and in the Data Factory.\nTherefore, the SuC needs to add information to each message (or provide another\nmethod) that allows to verify the integrity and authentication of each Sensor_Frame.\nThere might be sensors that do not support adding these information within the\nsensor. In these cases the information should be added at the earliest possible stage\nand resource demands and computation time may need to be considered and\nweighted with the benefits of support an authenticity and integrity verification at that\nstage.\n\n2.5.5.3 Data Content\ne The SuC shall attach all information to each Sensor Frame that are provided by the\nmanufacturer's sensor driver.\n\no Rationale: The Data_Logger shall be able to record all sensor information that is\navailable in the system unless technically infeasible. This means, that each sensor\ninformation that is available in the system shall arrive at the Data_Logger.\n\ne The SuC shall make processed Sensor Data_Stream available to the Data_Logger , if the\nprocessing adds information to the Sensor Data_Stream.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 44 of 213 17/12/2024",

Timestamp.\n\no Rationale: In order to precisely fuse frames that are recorded at the same / a similar\npoint in time, the physical acquisition time is required. Sensor fusion will likely be a\nkey concept for the environmental perception in GoA4 train operation and is required\nfor multi-modal data annotation.\n\ne The SuC shall provide a definition of what part of the sensor's actual physical acquisition\nprocess the Acquisition_ Timestamp is referring too.\n\no Rationale: Different sensors have different means of acquisition. In practice,\nacquisition can have multiple possible reference or \"anchor\" points in time, each of\nwhich might be equally appropriate, as long as it is clearly defined, which one is used.\nExamples: For global shutter cameras, possible references are start time of exposure\nor end time of exposure. For rolling shutter cameras, this shall additionally include the\nline of reference, as different lines of a rolling shutter sensor are exposed at different\ntimes. It shall also include the line time, i.e., the time delta between the exposure start\nof successive lines.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the Reference_Time for the system.\n\no Rationale: It is important to have the same understanding of time in the system in\norder to fuse Sensor_Frames from different sensors to a Sensor_MFrame using the\nacquisition time.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the Reference_Time in UTC.\n\no Rationale: Avoid leap seconds errors in the data by configuring all systems to use\nUTC instead of the atomic time.\n\ne The SuC shall make the Reference_Time available within 30s after system boot is completed.\n\no Rationale: To allow all systems to synchronise their time within 60s after system boot\ncompleted, the reference time has be available in advance.\n\ne The SuC shall provide timing signals for clock synchronisation in the system.\n\no Rationale: The reference clocks has to provide a time synchronisation service with a\nprotocol. The most common one is PTP.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure clocks deviate less than 1 ms from the Reference_ Time.\n\no Rationale: This is necessary to allow precise stamping of acquisition times and an\naccurate fusion of sensors. Common protocols such as PTP allow an accuracy up to\nless than a microsecond.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure clocks are synchronised to the Reference_Time within 60s after\nsystem boot is completed.\n\no Rationale: As one of the tasks in Data Factory is to ensure that the driving path is free\nbefore the train starts moving, the data while the train is still on the parking position\n\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 45 of 213 17/12/2024",

In order to capture and use this data, the reference time in the system\nshall be available within 60s after the system boot is completed.\n\ne The Acquisition Timestamp shall deviate less than 1 ms from the physical acquisition time\nof the sensor.\n\no Rationale: In order to allow a precise fusion of sensor data, the acquisition timestamp\nshall be as close as possible to the physical acquisition timestamp. The physical\nacquisition time is the reference time in the the system at the point in time when the\nhardware in the sensor registers the object. Common protocols such as PTP allow an\naccuracy up to less than a microsecond. With a speed of 100km/h, the train moves\naround 3cm per millisecond.\n\n2.5.5.5 Frequency & Synchronisation\n\ne The SuC shall ensure a stable and constant Acquisition_Frequency for each sensor.\n\no Rationale: A stable and constant acquisition frequency is required to reliably produce\nsynchronised sensor data that can be fused.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure that the Acquisition Timestamps between two consecutive\nSensor Frames have a maximum deviation of 5% or 2.5ms, whatever is lower, to the\nexpected delta which is calculated based on the target frequency (delta = 1/f).\n\no Rationale: This requirement defines the upper bounds for the requirement above by\nproviding concrete values for what is the lower bound for a stable and constant\nacquisition frequency. In the extreme (on sensor is -2.5 ms and the other one is +2.5\nms) this leads to an offset of 5ms within a Sensor _MFrame. With a speed of 100km/h\nthis will lead to an offset of 15cm in the worst case.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure that each Perception Sensor uses an Acquisition. Frequency that is\nan integer multiple of the Perception. Sensor with the lowest Acquisition _ Frequency.\n\no Rationale: This in mandatory in order to have multiple synchronised sensors with a\nstable and constant acquisition frequency.\n\ne The SuC_ shall ensure that the maximum percentage of Frame _ Drops per\nSensor_Data_Stream is lower than one per thousand (1/1000).\n\no Rationale: This requirement tolerates one frame drop at a maximum occurrence of\nonce every 1000 frames.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure an Acquisition Frequency of the Perception_Sensors of at least 10\nHz.\n\no Rationale: A frequency of 10 Hz allows to reevaluate the situation every 100ms and\ntherefore 10 times a second. It is necessary to increase the accuracy of tracking\nalgorithms by limiting the distance the train and objects move between two frames.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure an Acquisition. Frequency for the Coupled_Localisation of at least 50\nHz.\n\no Rationale: A high update frequency of the coupled localisation is important to get the\nmost accurate egomotion information for each sensor frame. As the coupled\nlocalisation consists of multiple modalities, such as GNSS, IMU, map matched\nlocalisation, not all modalities need to have an update frequency of 50 Hz.

Sensors synchronously.\n\no Rationale: In order to fuse sensor modalities and create multi-modal frames\n(Sensor _MFrames), all Perception Sensors have to capture their data at the same\npoint in time. For technical reasons, there might be sensor modalities that benefit from\na Slightly shift the acquisition time of these sensors to avoid artefacts (distortions),\nsuch as, e.g. multiple RADARs. When having a setup with multiple RADAR sensors\nit is common to trigger the central RADAR together with the other perception sensors\nand shift the left and right RADARs slightly in terms of acquisition time to reduce\ndistortion by the FMCW ramp.\n\ne The SuC shall allow a maximum difference between the Acquisition. Timestamps of the same\nSensor_MFrame of less than 5 ms for each Perception_Sensor.\n\no Rationale: When the train or objects are in motion, a large time offset of the acquisition\ntime of different sensor modalities of the same Sensor _MFrame will introduce errors\nin the sensor fusion. With a speed of 100km/h this will lead to an offset of 15cm in the\nworst case. This requirement implies that all synchronously triggered sensors have\nto trigger within a time period of 5 ms.\n\n2.5.5.6 Sensor Calibration\ne The SuC shall provide precise calibration information for each sensor.\n\no Rationale: In order to fuse the output of different sensors, a precise calibration is\nnecessary. In the context of the Data Factory this is for example necessary to create\na multi-modal sensor dataset.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration for each sensor.\n\no Rationale: The extrinsic calibration parameters are required to get a precise overall\ncalibration.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration with an accuracy of at least 1 cm for each\ntranslational axis.\n\no Rationale: From the experience of different projects this is a good lower bound. This\nmeasurement accuracy is easily achievable and limits the effort during annotation.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the extrinsic calibration with an accuracy of at least 0.2° for each\nrotational axis.\n\no Rationale: From the experience of different projects this is a good lower bound.\nRotational inaccuracy leads to an increasing positional error with increasing distance\nfrom the train. This measurement accuracy is easily achievable and limits the effort\nduring annotation. Calculation for error with 0.2°: 100m * tan(0.2°) = 0,35m which is\nalready a lot of offset for multi-modal annotation.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the intrinsic calibration for each sensor that uses intrinsic calibration\nparameters.\n\no Rationale: The intrinsic calibration parameters are required to get a precise overall\ncalibration.\n\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 47 of 213 17/12/2024",

In terms of data\nannotation it is required to match the position of the train on the digital map. Precise\nIMU information is required to perform egomotion compensation. GNSS and IMU\ninformation are used to generate metadata to search for specific scenarios such as\nthe train being at a specific area (geofence), the train drives below/above/within a\nspecific speed or accelerates below/above/with a specific threshold.\n\ne The SuC shall provide the GNSS position in WGS84 with the following values and units.\n\n« latitude [deg]\n\n= longitude [deg]\n\n« height/altitude [m]\n\n«= Incase the values and units differ from the required, the steps and equations\non how to convert to the required values and units shall be provided.\n\no Rationale: The GNSS position is required to match the sensor data with the digital\nmap.

The egomotion shall either be measured at\nthe positions of the LIDARs or measured at a reference position that allows to\ncalculate the egomotion at the positions of the LIDARs with a comparable precision\nby providing the necessary transformation information.\n\ne The SuC shall reduce the rolling shutter effect for cameras with a rolling shutter to a minimal\nlevel.\n\no Rationale: The rolling shutter effect introduces distortion (curvature) of objects. This\nreduces the precision of sensor fusion and increases the difficulty and effort for data\nannotation. It also introduces risks for matching objects to the digital map and\ndetecting changes in the environment compared to the digital map.\n\ne The SuC shall ensure that the curvature of objects is less than 2° for speeds up to 100 km/h\ncompared to the object recorded with a steady train.\n\no Rationale: A big distortion of objects makes it difficult to fuse objects between different\nsensors as the appearance and geometries of this objects differ. The example image\n(Figure 1 - in the document below) shows the effects of an angle of 4.5°. The distortion\nof the rolling shutter effect is always a trade-off with the exposure time. It might be\nnecessary to exceed the distortion limit in situations of low light.\n\n2.5.6 Data Annotation Requirements\n\nThe ensuing section delineates the format for annotating the dataset. Detailed information is\nsystematically organized in Appendix 4.1, which readers are encouraged to consult for\ncomprehensive understanding.\nContext of Machine Learning Annotations: In machine learning contexts, annotations are\nindispensable for preparing datasets that machine learning algorithms can efficiently interpret. These\nannotations encapsulate critical information regarding elements within data, such as the identification\nand classification of objects in imagery. Typically, this intricate process is carried out by trained\nannotators whose task is to ensure that the scenario depicted in the data is rendered comprehensible\nfor the algorithm. This document sets forth the requisite guidelines for annotating a variety of sensor\nmodalities, including but not limited to IR/-RGB cameras, RADAR, and LIDAR.

This also refers to e.g. parked cars of which the license plate could be\nvisible by a camera on the train.\n\nRisk analysis for people affected: The data protection risk for individuals can generally be\nconsidered low. The potential risks associated with the processing of personal data, such as\ndiscrimination, identity theft, financial losses, and reputational damage, can be entirely or at least\nlargely excluded here. Effects of processing the relevant data on the affected individuals are minimal\noverall.\n\nFrom the perspective of the affected individuals, the content and significance of the camera images,\ninsofar as any personal data can be recognized on them, are minimal in relation to the actual purpose\nof processing these images using algorithms and thus their conversion into a machine-readable\nenvironmental representation.\n\nThis is especially valid for cameras attached to the front of trains because these cover a limited area\nsurrounding the vehicle, there are no audio recordings or live transmissions of the data. The\nrecordings are thus limited in scope and functionality to what is necessary for creating environmental\nrepresentations, obstacle detection, and collision avoidance.\n\nAccess to the stored data must be kept strictly limited to a few authorized individuals and is controlled\nwith an access authorization concept within the implemented technical and organizational measures\n(see below). An identification of individuals in the data is not necessary for GoA4 development and\nshould thus be excluded during data processing. Data containing personal content must generally\nbe deleted after the end of the development (achieving the purpose of development). However, some\ndata might have to be kept for safety audits/safety argumentation according to the respective norms.\nBalance of interests between stakeholders:\n\ne Rail customers and people on a platform or other railway areas are usually already subject\nto video surveillance measures to ensure their safety. They are informed by respective\nposters or signs and accept these recordings as a part of their travel. The video surveillance\nrecordings are mostly long-term recordings, potentially live-viewed and cover the whole area\nof a train station or railway area. It can thus be concluded that an additional (very short!)\nrecording by camera on a train passing a platform does not constitute a huge change or\nadditional risk for a customer.\n\ne Individuals in the trackbed can be considered employees of a rail company or a contractor\nbecause due to safety requirements, areas around tracks are not public and may not be\naccessed by 3” party individuals. Therefore, the focus on data protection needs here can be\nseen with this employee/employer relationship in mind. It is thus important to integrate all\n\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 55 of 213 17/12/2024",

Considering these arguments (and many more depending on the specific\nimplementation of a project!) on the table, it can be assumed that a suitable solution in\ncompliance with GDPR can be negotiated between the stakeholder groups of a railway\nundertaking company. It could e.g. be a solution to only anonymize employees of the\ncompany in certain areas while the data from other areas remains unchanged or to limit the\ndata usage in other ways.\nHowever, these considerations cannot be done generally but only within the scope of a\nspecific project and development.\n\ne 3rd party individuals could be affected by recordings when the train runs close to public areas\nsuch as roads, level crossings etc. It can again be assumed that on the one hand, public area\nare often subject to video surveillance measures and also the recording on-board the train\nwill most likely only be very short and not capturing a longer trajectory or path of a person.\nAlso e.g. license plates visible in public areas are a common thing and are not considered\nan additional risk if they appear on a video recording. Limiting access to the data and not\nusing it for identification of individuals is a natural requirement here which should not interfere\nwith the needs for development of a GoA4 train.\n\ne On the other hand, railway undertakings (and their research & development partners)\ninterested in GoA4 development also have legitimate interests to develop such systems. In\norder to extend their business and make it sustainable for the future, they have a legitimate\ninterest to focus on new technologies and implement them for their business. These needs\ncan be assumed to be aggravated e.g. by the climate crisis and related interest to focus on\nclimate-friendly traffic technologies or also by a lack of train drivers that e.g. DB expects for\nthe future.\n\nThe general public is also expected to benefit from the development of GoA4 trains as e.g.\nan increased level of service, higher punctuality and more advantages are expected with\nGoA4 automation of railways as well as an overall technology development in Europe which\nis favourable for further future developments. All the aforementioned points are expected to\nconstitute very important interests in favour of developing GoA4 technologies.\nExpected technical/organisation measures to be taken according to GDPR: While the exact\nmeasures to be taken for ensuring a suitable balance of interest regarding privacy must be defined\naccording to a specific project need, we want to outline at least a few general remarks in this\ndocument:\n\ne Persons affected must be informed about potential video recordings. This can e.g. happen\nusing respective signs or posters once people enter an area in which the recording could\ntake place and must meet the respective GPRD requirements.\n\ne Generally, it has to be said that the occurrence of obstacles around rail tracks appears rare\nduring a train ride as trains are one of the safest measures of transport. The events of interest\nduring the processing are thus sparse and require larger times of recording, but on the other\n\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 56 of 213 17/12/2024",

If the scope is restricted, for example through\nanonymization or limitation of the range or the field of view of the cameras, there is a\nsignificant risk that the obstacle detection will be limited in its development and later may not\nreliably detect people in certain situations and trigger an automated emergency braking.\n\ne Anonymization of data is generally not possible. An anonymization would adversely affect\nthe training and evaluation of algorithms for the detection and classification of persons and\nobjects, compromising the achievement of the development goals.\n\nThe reasons for this are:\n\no Reduced image quality: Anonymization techniques often involve blurring or pixelating\nparts of images containing personal information, which can affect image quality. This\nimpairment can impact the ability of image recognition and object detection algorithms\nto accurately recognize and analyze visual features, leading to suboptimal\nperformance.\n\no Loss of context: Anonymization techniques can remove or alter context-related\ninformation in images. Example techniques include removing objects or parts of\nobjects (e.g., blackening faces). Furthermore, the environment surrounding the\nobjects might also be altered. This loss of context can affect the ability of image\nrecognition algorithms to correctly understand and interpret the visual data.\n\no Possible bias and generalization problems: Anonymization can create bias that\naffects the ability of image recognition algorithms to generalize from training data to\nreal-world scenarios. For example, if certain facial features are consistently covered,\nthe algorithm may struggle to recognize or classify individuals with similarly covered\nfeatures.\n\no Replacing personal data is problematic because, for instance, \"replacement faces\"\nmust represent a realistic image of all recorded individuals. This includes\ncharacteristics such as gender, skin colour, and age. However, evaluating precisely\nthese characteristics requires processing special categories of personal data\naccording to Article 9 of the GDPR.\n\nAlthough a general anonymization is not feasible, in the specific project setting,\nanonymization should of course be implemented where possible.\n\ne Storing of data should be done with the homologation procedure in mind. Although there is\nnot yet a clear path on homologation of GoA4 systems, it is likely that regulation will require\nall data used during the development to be stored for future reference or audits in case of\npotential safety issues. The data to be stored for such longer times must be selected carefully\nand the process must be accompanied by data protection experts to ensure compliance to\nboth technical norms and GDPR.\n\nWith these measures taken and a careful, considerate approach implemented together with close\ncollaboration by data protection experts and authorities, we conclude that the development of GoA4\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 57 of 213 17/12/2024",

The System Security Requirements are designed to\nsafeguard both the system and its data against a myriad of threats emanating from the environment.\nThese threats can be both intentional, such as hacking or theft, and accidental, such as malfunctions\nor natural disasters.\nThe System Security segment is dedicated to outlining the necessary defences and protocols to\nmaintain the ity, integrity, and availability of the system and its data. These elements are\ncrucial in mitigating the risk of operational disruptions, financial losses, and potential safety impacts\non stakeholders. Our approach is aligned with best practices and standards, including the adoption\nof an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001 [18] and a\nrisk-based security management strategy guided by ISO 27002 [19] controls.\nFurthermore, considering the Data Factory's pivotal role in developing algorithms for future railway\nsystems, we integrate security principles from the IEC 62443 [20] standard, which focuses on\nindustrial automation and control systems. This section elucidates our commitment to technical\nsecurity measures while assuming operational security is managed by the Data Factory operator,\nwho also provides essential security services such as asset management and network security.\nThe System Security Requirements are structured to address various aspects of security, aiming to\nensure the ity, integrity, and availability of the system and its data. Here is an overview\nof the structure based on the details provided:\n2.6.2.1 Technical Security Measures\ne Identity and Access Management: Ensuring only authorized users can access the system.\ne Privileged Access Management: Special controls for users with elevated access rights.\ne Data ity: Protecting data from unauthorized access and disclosure.\ne System Integrity: Ensuring data and system functionality are not improperly modified.\ne System Availability: Ensuring the system is accessible and usable when needed.\ne System Hardening: Implementing measures to reduce system vulnerabilities.\ne Asset and Patch Management: Keeping software updated and managing hardware assets.\ne Backup and Restore: Ensuring data can be recovered in the event of loss or corruption.\ne Logging and Monitoring: Keeping records of system activities for security analysis.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 65 of 213 17/12/2024",

Each subsystem is designed to fulfil a specific set of roles within the larger\necosystem, functioning as an integral piece of the puzzle that drives the Data Factory towards its\nstrategic objectives.\nThe purpose of detailing the subsystem requirements is to provide a comprehensive understanding\nof the individual and collective contributions of these components to the system's performance. By\ndelineating the specifications and requirements of each subsystem, we establish clear expectations\nfor functionality, interoperability, and performance standards that are necessary for the seamless\nintegration and optimization of the Data Factory.\nIn this section, we will explore the intricate makeup of each subsystem, elucidating their purposes,\nthe specific needs they address, and the mechanisms by which they contribute to the data lifecycle\nwithin the Data Factory. From data acquisition and management to processing and analytics, each\nsubsystem plays a pivotal role in ensuring data flows efficiently and securely, allowing for robust and\nscalable solutions tailored to meet our stakeholders’ diverse requirements.\nThrough this exploration, we will gain insight into how each subsystem's design and requirements\nalign with our strategic goals, ensuring that the Data Factory operates not just as a collection of\nindependent modules, but as a cohesive and harmonized unit, driving innovation and value creation.\nA note on the interactions: When an interaction is described as bi-directional (both in the text and\nthe images), then the exchanged data are regarded on a high level such that some specific types of\ndata are transferred in one direction, others in the other.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 76 of 213 17/12/2024",

To select the most suitable\ndata for a given application, efficient data management is indispensable. The Data Platform delivers\nthe essential functionalities for this purpose within the Data Factory. These encompass ingesting,\nprocessing, managing, curating, visualising, and annotating data as well as providing data to other\nsubsystems.\nUpon the arrival of new data at the Data Factory, the data ingestion process verifies file integrity\nand content, transforming the data into suitable formats for storage. Subsequently, data processing\npipelines are triggered to extract and generate metadata. This metadata enriches the unstructured\nsensor data, making it more manageable and searchable.\nUsers can explore stored data using a data catalogue and employ queries to find relevant samples\nfor their applications. These samples can then be organised into datasets for machine learning and\nsoftware validation. The Data Platform also governs data policies and rules that are enforced by the\ndata curation engine, such as access restrictions, data anonymisation, and data deletion.\nFurthermore, it facilitates both manual and automated labelling of sensor data and provides\nvisualizations alongside annotations. Serving as the central repository for data, the Data Platform\nensures seamless access to its data for other subsystems.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 82 of 213 17/12/2024",

This meticulous oversight enables accurate\nrepresentation and consistent quality in the simulation environment.\nIn parallel, the Scenario Sampler subsystem is engaged in the meticulous preparation, versioning,\narchiving, and parameter setting for scenarios. This process is vital for the development of diverse\nand realistic simulation scenarios, which are essential for testing and refining Data Factory\noperations.\nMoreover, the Generator is the driving force behind synthetic data creation. It is responsible for\nsimulating scenarios and recording the resulting synthetic data streams. It also conducts checks and\nstores this synthetic data, playing a crucial role in expanding the breadth and depth of data available\nfor simulations.\nTo ensure the reliability and accuracy of the simulations, the Validator is tasked with the validation\nof both digital twins and 3D assets. This ensures that the simulated environments and objects closely\nmirror their real-world counterparts.\nAdditionally, the Digital Twins Manager oversees the creation and importation of digital twins into the\nSimulation Platform. This function is integral to maintaining an updated and accurate digital\nrepresentation of physical assets within the simulation.\nThe Simulation Platform’s integration with the wider Data Factory environment is pivotal, providing\ncritical data that feeds into the operational decision-making process, driving innovation, and\nenhancing the overall functionality of the Data Factory.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 112 of 213 17/12/2024",

The efforts documented here reflect the development of the Data Factory - a\ncornerstone of the project architecture designed to lead the intelligent development of rail\ninfrastructure.\nBusiness Requirements and Goals Achievement: Regarding section 2.1, the Data Factory was\nset up with the needs and requirements of the stakeholders in mind. Its ability to handle data at all\nstages - collection, ingestion, processing and use for machine learning - demonstrates that the\nbusiness objectives of the project are being met. These fundamental elements have been set up\nphysically and toolchain-wise to ensure that the Data Factory is ready for further advances in rail\noperations technology.\nScenario Analysis: The evaluation of the scenarios in section 2.2, the assumptions and the project\nstructure based on InfraGO's experience played an important role in determining the course of the\nproject. However, due to the complexity and associated regulatory aspects, the use of the models in\nvehicles and the certification and approval processes posed a challenge that could not be fully\novercome within this task. This results in areas for future developments and regulatory\nconsiderations.\nInterconnected Work Packages and Projects: As outlined in section 2.3, the synergies with\ninterrelated work packages and predecessor projects such as X2Rail4 [16], Tauro Shift2Rail [3] and\nin particular CEF 2 RailDataFactory [4] and GaiaX CartenaX [21] were significant. The continuity\nprovided by the same thematic focus and staff number provided valuable opportunities to shape the\noutcome by leveraging previous findings and proven expertise.\nData Requirement Specification Compliance: In accordance with section 2.5, the project has\neffectively met the data requirement specifications and created a comprehensive data and sensor\nmodel. This achievement forms the basis for future data exchange, data sharing and the provision\nof an open dataset as envisaged in D7.6.\nSystem Evaluation: The system and its subsystems described in sections 2.6 and 2.7 have been\nassessed to effectively meet the needs of stakeholders and comply with security requirements. The\nvarious subsystems were divided into different functional units, each of which contributes to the\nsmooth operation of the Data Factory.\nIntegration and Dataflow: The analysis of the integration platforms and the data flow diagrams in\nsections 2.7.1 and 2.7.4 revealed a harmonious integration of components that together contribute\nto achieving the project objectives. The data flow diagrams in particular offer a differentiated view of\nthe relationships between the subsystems and open up new perspectives on their dependencies.\nSubsystems Within the Data Factory Architecture: The creation and mapping of the architecture\nof the Data Factory, as seen in the subsystems such as Data Platform, Data Touchpoint and others,\nhas enabled a structured and efficient development path. This made it possible to capture the goals\nalready achieved and a clear vision for the subsequent project phases.\nSubsystem Summaries Each subsystem has been evaluated for its contribution to the Data\nFactory:\ne The Vehicle Data Logger has proven effective in acquiring train data, a foundational step\nin the data lifecycle.\nFP2-WP07-D-DBA-014-02 Page 130 of 213 17/12/2024",
