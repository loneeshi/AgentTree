      "text": "Preface g\n2\na\n\nThe purpose of a Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation is to\n\nimprove railway safety by preventing future railway accidents or by mitigating their\n\nconsequences. It is not the purpose of such an investigation to establish blame or\n\nliability. Accordingly, it is inappropriate that RAIB reports should be used to assign\n\nfault or blame, or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting\n\nprocess has been undertaken for that purpose.\n\nRAIB’s findings are based on its own evaluation of the evidence that was available at\n\nthe time of the investigation and are intended to explain what happened, and why, in a\n\nfair and unbiased manner.\n\nWhere RAIB has described a factor as being linked to cause and the term is\n\nunqualified, this means that RAIB has satisfied itself that the evidence supports both\n\nthe presence of the factor and its direct relevance to the causation of the accident or\n\nincident that is being investigated. However, where RAIB is less confident about the\n\nexistence of a factor, or its role in the causation of the accident or incident, RAIB will\n\nqualify its findings by use of words such as ‘probable’ or ‘possible’, as appropriate.\n\nWhere there is more than one potential explanation RAIB may describe one factor as\n\nbeing ‘more’ or ‘less’ likely than the other.\n\nIn some cases factors are described as ‘underlying’. Such factors are also relevant\n\nto the causation of the accident or incident but are associated with the underlying\n\nmanagement arrangements or organisational issues (Such as working culture).\n\nWhere necessary, words such as ‘probable’ or ‘possible’ can also be used to qualify\n\n‘underlying factor’.\n\nUse of the word ‘probable’ means that, although it is considered highly likely that the\n\nfactor applied, some small element of uncertainty remains. Use of the word ‘possible’\n\nmeans that, although there is some evidence that supports this factor, there remains a\n\nmore significant degree of uncertainty.\n\nAn ‘observation’ is a safety issue discovered as part of the investigation that is not\n\nconsidered to be causal or underlying to the accident or incident being investigated,\n\nbut does deserve scrutiny because of a perceived potential for safety learning.\n\nThe above terms are intended to assist readers’ interpretation of the report, and to\n\nprovide suitable explanations where uncertainty remains. The report should therefore\n\nbe interpreted as the view of RAIB, expressed with the sole purpose of improving\n\nrailway safety.\n\nAny information about casualties is based on figures provided to RAIB from various\n\nsources. Considerations of personal privacy may mean that not all of the actual\n\neffects of the event are recorded in the report. RAIB recognises that sudden\n\nunexpected events can have both short- and long-term consequences for the physical\n\nand/or mental health of people who were involved, both directly and indirectly, in what\n\nhappened.\n\nRAIB’s investigation (including its scope, methods, conclusions and recommendations)\n\nis independent of any inquest or fatal accident inquiry, and all other investigations,\n\nincluding those carried out by the safety authority, police or railway industry.\n\nReport 12/2020 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "Summary 人\na\n\nShortly before 06:00 hrs on Thursday 23 January 2020, a wagon in the rear half of\n\na heavily loaded freight train derailed on a small radius curve as it crossed a bridge\n\nin east London. The forces from the train caused the rails on the bridge, which were\n\nattached to large longitudinal timbers, to spread apart. Two adjacent wheelsets\n\nfrom different wagons derailed, but one wheelset re-railed itself after travelling a\n\nshort distance. The other wheelset remained derailed as the train continued for 2.5\n\nmiles (4.1 km) before stopping, and this caused significant track damage. Wagons\n\npositioned behind the derailed wagons remained on the track.\n\nTrack where the rails are supported on longitudinal timbers is subject to special\n\ninspections by staff who have received additional training to undertake this role.\n\nRAIB found that the condition of the timbers at the point of derailment had severely\n\ndeteriorated because of rot, but this was concealed by their superficially good exterior\n\ncondition. The inspection method and tools used by Network Rail staff were not\n\nsufficient to detect the poor internal condition of the timber.\n\nThe widening of the track gauge was identified, by track recording vehicles operated\n\nby Network Rail, six times between March 2019 and January 2020. On three\n\noccasions, the track maintenance gangs responded but undertook work in a nearby\n\nlocation due to erroneous GPS data. On three other occasions, the track recording\n\nvehicles’ software did not report the location of the fault so maintenance staff remained\n\nunaware of it.\n\nOne wagon in the train exerted sufficient force on the weakened track support to force\n\nthe rails apart and cause the wagon to derail. Examination of the first wagon to derail\n\nand its maintenance records indicated that it had experienced unusually rapid wheel\n\nwear over several years. It is possible that this meant it was imposing higher than\n\nnormal lateral forces on the track and that this is related to a defect which affected the\n\nway the bogie was able to rotate.\n\nFollowing the failure of a longitudinal timber on a bridge in the same area in August\n\n2017, Network Rail launched a review resulting in an updated standard for the detailed\n\ninspection and management of longitudinal timbers. The updated standard was under\n\ndevelopment at the time of the accident, and was published in March 2020.\n\nRAIB has made one recommendation to Network Rail regarding improvements in\n\nthe provision of track recording vehicle data to track maintenance staff, and one\n\nrecommendation to the wagon owner concerning the monitoring of maintenance\n\nactivities to reduce the risk of defective rail vehicles entering service. It has identified\n\nthree learning points covering the management of longitudinal timber systems and\n\nloading activities in freight loading terminals.\n\nReport 12/2020 7 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

The rear wheelset\nof the leading of these wagons derailed with its right-hand wheel dropping to run\ninside the right-hand rail. The derailment occurred on a curve when rail movement\nresulted in an increase in the distance between the rails, known as gauge\nwidening or a wide gauge fault. This occurred on a bridge on which the rails were\nsupported on longitudinal timbers running continuously beneath each rail.\n5 About seven metres beyond the initial point of derailment (POD), and at the end\nof the bridge, the leading left-hand wheel of the following wagon derailed with\nits left-hand wheel running inside the left-hand rail. The five following wagons\ncontinued without derailing after the rails were able to move back and the gauge\nreduced.\n6 The derailed train continued for 4.1 km (2.5 miles), travelling at up to 35 mph\n(56 km/h) and causing extensive damage to the track. The driver was unaware\nof the derailment until the brake pipe between the two affected wagons\nseparated causing the train brakes to apply automatically. The train came to a\nstand between Leyton Midland Road and Walthamstow Queens Road stations\n(figure 1).\n7 The railway between Woodgrange Park Junction and South Tottenham East\nJunction was closed for repair for 27 days, reopening on 19 February 2020.\nFH A VOR Se Ga ae tiie Sano TST ISSA SREP RO eee ons\nA) i eee oe Nee 3\nWEP SY (fe NA NE | ile IH ELON WEN CAC a .\ntelly.

In the 12\nyears prior to the derailment, the route saw a 500% increase in the amount of\ntraffic, due to increased passenger services and the opening of new freight and\nport facilities in east London and Essex (paragraph 55).\n\n11 The train involved in the accident (train reporting number 6254) was travelling\nwest on the up Tottenham & Hampstead line. The derailment occurred as the\ntrain crossed bridge TAH2/456 spanning Lorne Road, a residential road in\nForest Gate.

This normally requires the complete reconstruction of a bridge to take\nheavier ballasted track. On Anglia route, there are still about 200 track spans fitted\nwith longitudinal timbers of which about 30% are softwood and the remainder\nhardwood. A single span bridge carrying two tracks is counted as two track spans\nin this data, and some larger structures carry one or more tracks over several\nsuccessive track spans. The 200 track spans represent about 4% of Anglia route’s\ntotal number of underbridge spans where roads, watercourses or other features\npass under the railway.\n\n2/7 Bridge 456 was constructed in 1893 using fabricated steel girders and a metal\ndeck and the line opened in the following year. The bridge has a single span of\n20.5 metres between abutments, which are skewed at 25° to cater for the relative\nalignments of the railway and Lorne Road. The bridge carries two tracks on\nseparate, parallel decks with two outer main girders, and a central main girder\npositioned between the tracks.\n\n28 The longitudinal timbers vary in depth between 275 mm on the left-hand (cess)\nand 350 mm on the right-hand (six-foot) rail. The difference in depth is required\nto achieve a designed track cross-level (cant) of 75 mm. The longitudinal timbers\nwere last renewed in 2008.\n\n29 Network Rail monitors its track using a fleet of track recording vehicles. These\nvehicles are formed into trains and cover the national network to a pre-determined\nschedule. They provide data and information to assist track maintenance staff to\nlocate track faults.\n\nReport 12/2020 14 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "Analysis 4\n3\n<\n\nIdentification of the immediate cause\n\n43 The track was unable to maintain the correct gauge as train 6254 passed\nover it.\n\n44 Aderailment mark on the inside face of the right-hand rail on bridge 456 showed\nthat a wheel had dropped into the four-foot (the area between the rails) at\nthis location. Another derailment mark was identified on the inside face of the\nleft-hand rail about seven metres beyond the first mark, showing that a second\nwheel dropped into the four-foot. Post-accident examination of the two wagons\ninvolved showed that the wheels on the derailed wheelsets were at the correct\nspacing. There was no evidence that they had moved inwards, along the axle, at\nany time. This demonstrates that derailment was a consequence of rail movement\ncausing the track gauge (the horizontal distance between the rails) to increase by\nat least 85 mm, sufficient to allow the right-hand wheel of a wagon to drop inside\nthe right-hand rail (figure 7). The locations of the derailed wheelsets (trailing on\none bogie and then leading on a following bogie) and the wheels (right then left)\nare consistent with classic curving behaviour of a conventional bogie vehicle\non small radius curves, and explain the order that the wheels dropped into the\nfour-foot.\n\n45 The absence of derailment marks on the right-hand wheel of wagon 3114 shows\nthat wagon 3415 derailed at the first (right-hand rail) derailment mark and\nwagon 3114 at the second (left-hand rail). It is likely that spreading of the rails\nby the derailed wheelset of wagon 3415 provided room for the leading wheelset\nof the following wagon 3114 to derail. The absence of significant damage to\nthe left-hand rail at the location where wagon 3415 derailed indicates that the\naccident was initially caused by the right-hand rail rotating or moving outwards.\n\n46 The relatively low speed of the train meant that the cross-level or cant at this\nlocation was greater than required, a condition known as cant excess. When cant\nexcess is present on a small radius curve, the leading outer wheelset on a bogie\nwould be expected to be displaced to the outside of the curve (right wheel) and\nthe trailing wheelset displaced toward the inside (left wheel), and this is the likely\nreason why it was the right wheel on the trailing wheelset of the trailing bogie of\nwagon 3415 that dropped into the four-foot.\n\n47 Adefect pushing the leading wheelset of the trailing bogie further towards the\nright-hand rail (paragraph 113) is likely to have increased outward lateral forces\non the right-hand rail.\n\nIdentification of causal factors\n\n48 The accident occurred due to a combination of the following causal factors:\n\na. the rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide\ngauge (paragraph 49)\n\nb. track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived from\nthis data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the correct\nlocation (paragraph 74)\n\nReport 12/2020 19 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

Network Rail was not aware of the severity of the longitudinal timber\n全 degradation and so took no action to deal with this (paragraph 95)\na d. the condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high\nlateral forces on the track (paragraph 111).\nEach of these factors is now considered in turn.\n\n49 The rail restraint was inadequate leading to a persistent problem with wide\ngauge.\n\n50 The up line across bridge 456 was supported by four longitudinal timbers under\neach rail, each about 6 metres long and laid end to end. The combined length of\njust over 24 metres was sufficient to cross the bridge and extend a few metres\nonto the embankment at each end, a feature known as a flying end. This was to\nprovide a transition between the relatively stiff bridge deck and the more flexible\nballasted embankment. In the direction of travel, the timbers were numbered\nR4 to R1 supporting the left-hand rail (cess rail) and 4L to 1L supporting the\nright-hand rail (six-foot rail).

If either static or dynamic gauge reaches 1450 mm, the alert limit <\nis exceeded and track maintenance staff are required to plan remedial action.\n\nIf the static plus dynamic movement reaches 1460 mm, the intervention limit is\nexceeded and remedial action is required within 14 days, or 36 hours if gauge\nreaches 1470 mm. If the static gauge plus the additional deflection from passing\ntrains is 1478 mm or greater, the immediate action limit is reached and the line\nmust be immediately blocked to all traffic. These limits are equivalent to wide\ngauge of 15 mm (alert limit), 25 mm and 35 mm (intervention limits) and 43 mm\n(immediate action limit).\n\n53 Bridge 456’s longitudinal timbers were last renewed in 2008 using Douglas Fir\n(softwood). Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 (issue 4), which was current\nin 2008, stated:\n\n‘For complete replacement of Longitudinal Timbers on lines with track\ncategories 1A, 1 and 2 only hardwood shall be used. Hardwood timber shall be\nused for other lines unless the written approval is obtained from the Railtrack\nDirector’s Nominee for the use of softwood.’\n\n54 The track category is derived from the speed of traffic and equivalent tonnage\nusing the line, and ranges from 6 (low speed and low use) to 1A, the highest.\n\nIt is used to determine inspection frequencies and renewals specifications. In\n2008, this section of line carried 2.9 equivalent million gross tonnes per annum?\n(EMGTPA) and was rated track category 4.\n\n55 Between 2008 and 2018, there was a significant increase in rail traffic using\nthe Barking to Gospel Oak route. During this period the annual tonnage carried\nincreased fivefold from 2.9 EMGTPA to 15.5 EMGTPA. This was due to both the\ndoubling of the frequency of passenger services operated by London Overground,\nand increased freight traffic associated with Barking Eurohub and the London\nGateway container port near Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, which opened in 2013. As\ntraffic increased, the track category changed in steps from 4 to 2. It subsequently\ndropped back to category 3 in the immediate vicinity of bridge 456 due to the\n40 mph (64 km/h) permanent speed restriction at that location. Most of the route\nremained within track category 2 (paragraph 22).\n\n56 The maximum weight of vehicles permitted over bridge 456 was managed\nthrough Network Rail’s Route Availability (RA) process. The highest routine\ncategory is RA8 which permits rail vehicles with a maximum gross laden weight\nof 91.4 tonnes, but heavier freight wagons are permitted on some lines by a\ndispensation issued using Network Rails RT3973 Heavy Axle Weight process\nafter an assessment by the route’s structures and track engineers. Over 25% of\nloaded freight trains operate under a dispensation. The Barking to Gospel Oak\nroute had a dispensation allowing its use by wagons of the types in train 6254\nloaded to RA10, a category permitting a maximum gross laden weight of 101.6\ntonnes and a maximum axle load of 25.4 tonnes.\n\n2 The EMGTPA value is obtained by multiplying actual annual tonnage of traffic by factors allowing for axle weight\n\nand speed.\n\nReport 12/2020 21 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

A hydraulic ram was =\ninstalled between the rails, and the pressure was increased in increments, <\ncreating spreading forces up to 50 kN (equivalent to 5 tonnes). This test was\nrepeated at five locations across the bridge. The results show that the rails were\nless able to resist movement under the lateral forces imposed by moving trains\nas the point of derailment was approached (figure 14). These results are broadly\nconsistent with Network Rail’s track gauge measurements. However, it should\nbe noted that accident damage meant that measured stiffness in the area of\nsignificant damage will be less than before the accident and, due to distribution\nof load along the rails, measured stiffness will also be lower than pre-accident\nvalues on the approach to this area.\n\nBridge 456 Up line - RAIB rail spreader bar tests\n400\n-+ Between baseplates 32 & 33\n350 Between baseplates 19 & 20\n~ Between baseplates 3 & 4\n300 Between baseplates 2 & 3\n-e-Between baseplates 0 & 1\n\n. 250\n\n2 200\n\n上\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n1440 1450 1460 1470 1480 1490 1500 1510 1520\nGauge in mm\n\nFigure 14: Change in track stiffness between baseplates.

A\nnew rail is rolled to a constant profile, but the wear from passing train wheels,\nparticularly on the outside rail on curved track, will gradually change this shape.\nThe rail showed a relatively consistent amount of wear on the side of the railhead\n(sidewear), but a pronounced change occurred a few metres before the point of\nderailment. In this area, there was less sidewear, suggesting that lateral loads\nfrom train wheels caused the rail to move away from the wheel flanges.

Preservative\ntreatments limited to near the surface of the wood can result in timber appearing\nsuperficially sound while deeper decay is hidden.\n\n68 It is probable that the rot was partly a consequence of rust flakes collecting on\nthe deck and trapping moisture around the base of the timbers. Evidence that\nthis was occurring is provided by photographs taken during an inspection in June\n2018 (figure 22). Some of this debris was removed during bridge strengthening\nand refurbishment works completed later that year. It is also probable that\nevaporation of water from the bridge deck and some faces of the longitudinal\ntimbers was restricted by the solid walkway installed between the rails on the up\nline in 2008, which restricted ventilation (figure 5).\n\nee No es ea ox UW OR 、 Sy:\nfee Meta eS OS ROA en 六\npe 8 ae ws ene ke ro fe\n\n- DL ly eR A SN :\n\nFigure 22: Photograph from detailed inspection report dated 7 June 2018 showing a restraining cleat\n\nand rust flakes on the bridge deck prior to deck refurbishment (courtesy of Network Rail)\n\n3 BS EN 350:2016 Durability of wood and wood-based products — Testing and classification of the durability to\n\nbiological agents of wood and wood-based materials.\n\nReport 12/2020 26 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "Lateral restraint to timbers 2\n69 Lateral restraint for the longitudinal timbers was provided by cleats attached to 3\nthe bridge deck and by the tie rod and transom (strut) arrangement described in <\nparagraph 24. The timbers supporting the right-hand rail were significantly deeper\nthan the timbers supporting the left-hand rail due to the need to allow a 75 mm\ncant on the curve (paragraph 28).\n70 The height of the cleats retaining the right-hand rail timbers was less than 50%\nof the timbers’ depth (figure 23). The combined effect of the cleat height and\ntie rod position was to leave the upper section of the timbers 4L-1L with no\nlateral restraint except that provided by transferring load downwards through\nthe decayed timber. The tie rods connecting the timbers together to maintain\ntrack gauge were set horizontally. They passed through the left-hand timbers at\nmid-height, but consequently were below mid-height for the deeper right-hand\ntimbers (figure 24).\n71 Arevision to standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 (issue 6) published in 2014, requires\nnew or replacement cleats to be designed with a minimum height of not less\nthan 2/3 the depth of the longitudinal bearer. Although this requirement was not\nretrospective, it gives an indication of the importance of the relative height of the\ncleats in restraining the timbers, particularly on curved track where the track is\nsubject to lateral forces.\nE 4 Junction 200 mm |\nE 7 A Plate. 2 iB\n® og ty Me nr : a 加 村 Oya\nFigure 23: The position of a cleat (marked ‘A’) Figure 24: The position of a tie rod (marked ‘B’)\nrestraining timber 2L with a metal packing behind, _ restraining timber 2L\nand a junction plate connecting timber 2L to\ntimber 1L\n72 Junction plates connecting the timbers also extended for only part of the timbers’\ndepth (figure 23).

      "text": "> 73 The track’s ability to resist gauge widening on bridge 456 is likely to have\n\n全 worsened when the vertical split in timber 1L joined up with a horizontal split,\n\n2. displacing a section of timber (figure 20). Some of the gauge widening forces\nwhich could not be resisted by timber 1L will have been transferred by the rail into\nthe adjacent section of timber 2L which was already weakened by decay.\n\n74 Track recording vehicles identified a wide gauge fault but output derived\nfrom this data did not result in track maintenance staff repairing faults at the\ncorrect location.\n\n75 Track geometry data obtained from track recording vehicles (paragraph 29) is\nsupplied to the TME responsible for each section of track. They are required by\nNetwork Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/001/mod11 to review this data within three\nweeks of issue. The data includes a trace, comprising a multi-channel graph\nshowing gauge, alignment and other track geometry parameters.\n\n76 Geometry faults which exceed the intervention limit are also listed, with their\nglobal positioning system (GPS) co-ordinates, on a track geometry action report.\nThis is also Known as an immediate action report or fault report. Network Rail\nstates that these co-ordinates are accurate to t+1m, providing the track recording\nvehicle is able to receive a strong enough GPS signal. The signal can be\nrestricted when a train is within a structure such as a tunnel or station. There are\nno features of this type at the accident site.\n\nEvidence of track movement at bridge 456\n\n77 RAIB has reviewed track recording vehicle data for the up line across bridge\n456 from June 2018 onwards. On 20 June 2018, a dynamic wide gauge fault of\n23 mm was recorded on bridge 456. This value was 8 mm greater than static\ngauge recorded at the same location during a detailed inspection on 6 June 2018\n(paragraph 97), indicating that track movement was already occurring under\ntrains. At this stage, the dynamic gauge fault remained below the intervention limit\n(25 mm).\n\n78 Similar gauge faults were apparent on two subsequent track recording vehicle\nruns during 2018, but the run on 6 February 2019 indicated that the gauge had\nsignificantly improved, recording wide gauge of just 10.5 mm near the POD.\nHowever, the next run on 6 March 2019 recorded a wide gauge fault of 26.9 mm.\nNetwork Rails central track geometry processing team compared this data with\nthe previous recording on 6 February 2019 and declared the gauge data invalid\nfor a 10 chain (201 metre) length of track which, by chance, included bridge 456.\nConsequently, the data was discounted and did not appear in the associated fault\nreport so no action was taken. RAIB has identified that the February data was\nsignificantly different to previous recordings and may itself have been spurious.\n\n79 On 1 May 2019, the next track recording vehicle run recorded a wide gauge fault\nof 29.8 mm in the same location, exhibiting a similar ‘shape’ to the data recorded\non 6 March (figure 25). This was the first recognised indication of a gauge fault\nexceeding the intervention limit at this location, and was shown on the trace and\nlisted on the fault report.\n\nReport 12/2020 28 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

The team leader stated that they used an approved app on a Network Rail\nmobile phone to locate the fault. This app works by manually entering the GPS\nco-ordinates, and this causes the phone to vibrate when within five metres of the\nsite, and the display to change colour when within three metres, giving staff a\nthree to five metre radius around the reported site to locate and inspect the fault.\nThe process is dependent on the mobile phone’s accuracy when receiving the\nGPS signal. In this case, although the GPS co-ordinates put the fault on bridge\n456 (figure 26), staff undertook work about eight metres west of the actual fault\nlocation and on a section of track with concrete sleepers.\n\n81 The team leader used a cross-level gauge to identify a section of track with\nwide gauge, and found nine concrete sleepers with crushed or displaced nylon\ninsulation pads* supporting the right-hand (high) rail. Members of the team\nunclipped the rail, renewed the nylon pads and clipped the rail back up. When\nthey rechecked with the cross-level gauge, it showed that the gauge was back\nwithin tolerance. The team leader signed a form to confirm that work had been\nundertaken, and under the heading ‘Details of work carried out to repair the\nfault’, wrote ‘Regauged track’. The team leader stated that he had a quick look at\nthe longitudinal timbers on the bridge and measured the gauge but did not find\nanything to suggest a wide gauge fault that exceeded the intervention limit on the\nbridge.\n\n82 On 29 May 2019, the next scheduled track recording vehicle run identified and\nrecorded a wide gauge fault in the same location and same magnitude as on 1\nMay (figure 27). The shape of the graph indicated a very similar pattern of gauge\nwidening. On this occasion, the GPS co-ordinates on the fault report put the\nlocation of the wide gauge fault just off the bridge.\n\n4 Pads are required to electrically insulate the rail from sleepers and clips, and are available in different sizes so\n\nthey can be used to adjust the track gauge.\n\nReport 12/2020 29 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "89 The TrueTrak recording system used by Network Rail’s fleet of track recording 2\nvehicles incorporates a feature to provide a single GPS location for each track =\ngeometry fault. Fault sheets are produced following each run which show the <\ntype of fault detected, its magnitude and the GPS location where the fault is\nmost severe. They do not show the distance over which the fault extends. To\nenable it to distinguish between consecutive faults, the processing software\napplies a pre-set quantity known as the hysteresis threshold value. The recorded\nmagnitude of the fault must improve until it is better than this threshold forthe\nsystem to register the end of one fault and the start of the next.\n\n90 For wide gauge, the hysteresis threshold value was set nationally at 5.8 mm,\nequivalent to a gauge of 1440.8 mm. However, as gauge widening may occur\nover long sections of track, particularly on curves, only identifying the location and\nmagnitude of the peak (widest) reading will have the effect of hiding other peaks\nwithin a length of track which continually exceeds the threshold.\n\n91 On both 11 December 2019 and 8 January 2020, the hysteresis threshold value\nfor gauge was exceeded continuously for a distance of about 240 metres on a\nsection of track which included bridges 456 and 448. Consequently, this was\nreported as a single fault with a GPS location corresponding to the maximum\nrecorded wide gauge which occurred at bridge 448. The lower peak on bridge 456\nwas not reported on either fault sheet and was therefore not addressed.\n\n92 Gauge widening greater than the hysteresis threshold between bridges 456 and\n448 probably occurred because of a combination of worn or damaged nylon\ninsulation pads and rail wear. Network Rail has confirmed that this section of track\ndid not require designed gauge widening.s\n\n93 When the trace and fault reports were received by the TME following a track\nrecording vehicle run, technical staff at Barking depot reviewed the trace and\ncompared it with the previous trace. The purpose was to identify repeat faults\nand poor sections of track where intervention is required. Actionable faults which\nexceeded the intervention limit (also known as Level 2 faults) were reviewed\nat a regular maintenance planning meeting and entered into Network Rail’s\ncomputerised workbank (Ellipse) so they could be monitored and closed-out\nwhen remedial work was complete. The TME did not consider that it was the\nresponsibility of the depot staff to check that faults shown on the trace were\nincluded on the fault reports and there was no requirement to do so in the\nNetwork Rail procedure TRK/001 mod 11 ‘Track geometry - Inspections and\nminimum actions’, issue 8 published in September 2015. However, if the review\nby depot staff identified an anomaly, this would be checked with the central track\ngeometry processing team and, if necessary, the fault would be added to the\nEllipse work bank for correction.\n\n94 The data from the track recording vehicle run on 8 January was received by the\nTME on 15 January. At the time of the accident, the technical review was ongoing\nin preparation for a maintenance planning meeting scheduled for 23 January (the\nday of the accident).\n\n5 Track gauge is sometimes deliberately designed to be a few millimetres wider than 1435 mm on tight curves to\n\nreduce rail wear.\n\nReport 12/2020 33 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

This was a role for which he had received specialist training and\nwhich he had undertaken for six years. He was responsible for inspecting 21\nstructures, most of which comprised two individual spans and which incorporated\n282 individual timbers.\n\n97 Although the team leader was not undertaking a scheduled Supervisor’s visual\ntrack inspection, he used form TEF3021 ‘Supervisor’s Visual Inspection of\nLongitudinal Timbers — Issue 6 Sept 2013’ to record static gauge readings at 12\npositions across the bridge, as there was nowhere to record this information on\nthe detailed inspection form itself. His report indicates that the static track gauge\nranged between 1445 mm and 1455 mm, equivalent to wide gauge of 10 mm to\n20 mm. As the static gauge exceeded the alert limit of 1450 mm, equivalent to\nwide gauge of 15 mm, at several locations towards the middle of the bridge, he\nrecorded ‘adjust gauge’ on this form.\n\n98 He also used form TEF3014 ‘Detailed Inspection of Longitudinal Timber System\nreport — Issue 5 Dec 2010’ to record the detailed inspection. He noted that timber\n2L was in ‘good’ condition, but that there was a 300 mm long split at the end of\nthe timber where the derailment occurred. He recorded that timber 1L was in ‘fair\ncondition with rot starting at the end furthest from timber 2L. He also identified\nthat the plate decking was corroding, with debris on the bridge. He assessed that\nall the timbers on the up line had five years’ remaining life. On the final page, he\nrecorded ‘Some of the timbers are starting to show signs of deterioration on the\nup road [up line] so life span has been reduced.’\n\n99 The GRP walkway fitted between the timbers had not been removed as required\nby standard TRK/3038 (issue 6), so the team leader was unable to view the\ninside faces of the timber. Clause 8.2 which covers the annual detailed inspection\nstates:\n\n‘Where walkway boards prevent inspection of significant elements of the\nlongitudinal timber system e.g. cleats, transoms and tie rods, the boards shall\nbe removed to allow inspection.’\n\n100 The team leader recorded ‘Underside of timbers not inspected’ and ‘Inside of\ntimber not accessible due to fibre glass walkway in his report.\n\n101 The presence of fixed walkways was an ongoing issue at four spans on the\nBarking to Gospel Oak line where there were walkways installed, including\nbridges 456 and 448. The team leader stated that walkways were never removed\nfor inspections (figure 32). The walkway on bridge 456 had been installed to\nassist staff walking along the track, but as the bridge was located on a section of\ntrack where access was prohibited except during a possession or line blockage,\nit was rarely used. As there was insufficient time during a possession to remove/\nreinstall the walkways and complete a detailed examination, the TME planned to\nhave the walkways removed permanently during 2020.\n\nReport 12/2020 34 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

On 19\nJune 2019, he undertook an annual detailed inspection of bridge 456. He used\nform TEF3021 to record the gauge which ranged from 1448 mm to 1453 mm,\nequivalent to wide gauge of 13 mm to 18 mm, and was 14 mm near the POD. The\ngauge exceeded the alert limit but remained below the intervention limit and he\nrecorded ‘adjust gauge’ on the form.\n\n104 During the detailed inspection he stated that he checked for damage, loose\nscrews, and large splits but found nothing loose. He was unable to inspect the\ninside of the timbers and reported ‘inside of timber not accessible due to fibre\nglass walkway’ . He also identified that 12 cleats were corroding and wrote ‘New\ncleat system required.’\n\n105 He identified a split in timber 1L and observed that part of the timber was out of\nalignment. He recorded ‘15mm split in the relevant part of the TEF3104 report\nand included three photographs of the split in his report (figure 33 and figure 34).\n\nReport 12/2020 35 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "110 On the report for the 22 August 2019 inspection, the supervisor wrote ‘timber 2\ngauge job’ with a reference number. This referred to a work order to correct the =\nwide gauge fault that had been raised in Ellipse on 25 July 2018 following the <\nnote added to the detailed inspection report the previous month (paragraph 97).\nHowever, this activity had been repeatedly reprioritised and the work deferred\nbecause site reports and inspections indicated that the gauge was not\ndeteriorating and had not yet exceeded the intervention limit. The TME also\nunderstood that the previous five track recording vehicle runs had shown there\nwere no gauge faults on the bridge, and that the gauge faults that were shown\nrelated to the concrete sleepers near the bridge with crushed nylon pads where\nremedial work had been undertaken (paragraph 81). Although there was an\nestablished process for raising queries, the TME did not consider it was his\nteam’s responsibility to cross-check the centrally-produced fault sheets against\nthe traces for errors or omissions.\n\n111 The condition of the trailing bogie on wagon 3415 imposed unusually high\nlateral loading on the track.\n\n112 The curving behaviour of conventional rolling stock means that significant lateral\ntrack forces are normal when trains negotiate small radius curves. However,\nthe presence of unusually high lateral forces applied to the track by the trailing\nbogie of wagon 3415 is suggested by the following six wagons not derailing when\ntravelling over the position where the bogie derailed (the leading bogie of wagon\n3114 derailed beyond this position). This implies that the rails on the curve spread\noutwards as the trailing bogie of wagon 3415 travelled past, and moved back\nbefore the remaining wagons passed. Damage to bridge timbers (paragraphs 62\nto 73) indicates that most of the spread was due to movement of the right-hand\nrail. It is possible that the trailing bogie applied unusually high lateral forces\nbecause of a combination of the following two factors:\n\ne a defect on wagon 3415 (paragraph 113)\ne uneven payload (paragraph 124).\n\nDefect on wagon 3415\n\n113 Evidence that wagon 3415's trailing bogie was imposing a high lateral force\n(figure 35) on the right-hand rail is provided in the following paragraphs by\nconsidering wheel flange wear over the previous three years. Curving behaviour\nunder cant excess suggests that the right wheel flange of the trailing bogies of\neach wagon would have been close to, and probably in contact with, the outer\n(right-hand) rail (paragraph 46).\n\nReport 12/2020 37 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

On 23 January 2020, the 2-3 end of the wagon was leading so the\ntrailing bogie was at the 1-4 end of the wagon. Analysis of maintenance records\nprovided by the wagon’s owner, VTG, shows that wagon 3415 was removed\nfrom service in November 2017, August 2018 and September 2019 because its\nwheel flanges had worn thin and were approaching the wear limit. For wheels with\nthe P6 profile, as fitted to this wagon, the minimum permitted flange thickness\nis 24 mm. On each occasion, the significant flange wear had occurred to the\nwheels fitted to the 1-4 end bogie, but only affected one wheel on each wheelset.\nRecords do not show whether this was the left-hand side or right-hand side. On\neach occasion, two full profile wheelsets were fitted to the 1-4 end bogie before\nthe wagon re-entered traffic. VTG’s Wheel Exchange Authorisation forms show\nthat throughout this time, the wheelsets on the 2-3 end bogie experienced normal\nwear and were not changed.\n\n115 The most recent wheelset change took place in October 2019. Following the\nderailment on 23 January 2020, wheel measurements showed that the right-hand\nflanges on the two wheelsets fitted to the 1-4 end bogie were at least 2 mm\nthinner than those on the left-hand wheels, despite having been in service for\nless than four months. This unusually high wear is consistent with the right-hand\nwheels of this bogie running for longer in flange contact with the rail than the\nleft-hand wheels.\n\n116 Adetailed inspection of the 1-4 end bogie, undertaken by RAIB before the wagon\nbody was lifted from the bogie, found that the bogie centre pivot, provided to allow\nbogie rotation when the wagon goes around curves, was offset by 7 mm to the\nright of the wagon body centre-line. This suggested an issue with the bogie pivot\nso RAIB and VTG carried out further examinations of this centre pivot, and the\n2-3 end bogie centre pivot, after the body was lifted from the bogies.\n\nReport 12/2020 38 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

Samples of the grease were\nformed into 12 mm diameter x 4.7 mm thick pellets and placed into a testing rig\nwhich restricted lateral expansion. A force of up to 60 KN (6,000 kg) was applied\nand the amount of compression measured and recorded.

The test rig reproduced loading conditions that were\nsimilar to those that the grease plug was subject to when constrained in the\nbogie pivot. As the top of the central upstand has a surface area of approximately\n6,000 mm’, the grease plug would have been capable of carrying the weight of\none end of a fully loaded wagon body.\n121 When the bogie was installed, the grease would have been of a normal viscosity\nand would have flowed relatively freely. Grease contains oil and a thickening\nagent, but on examination, the grease had lost the volatile compounds of the oil,\nand gained some debris. This had resulted in it gradually hardening to form the\nplug found in the recess.\n122 The source and role of the three pieces of metal debris in the grease plug is\nuncertain, but they may have formed as a result of earlier repair work. It is\npossible that the metal debris had played a part in transferring part of the wagon\nbody load into an off-centre position on the upstand, so encouraging an uneven\nbuild-up of dried grease to one side of the pivot.

The defect is not considered sufficient in itself to have\nresulted in the lateral loading needed to cause the derailment. This is evidenced\nby the same bogie passing over bridge 456 without derailing on nine previous\noccasions in the same month (paragraph 19).\n\nUneven payload\n\n124 The wagons of train 6254 had been weighed when they arrived at Barking\nfor loading, and again after they were loaded on 23 January 2020. On both\noccasions, the weighing equipment recorded the weight of each wheel. Weighing\non arrival allowed the amount of residual payload from previous journeys to be\ntaken into account when determining the maximum amount of material which\nshould be loaded at Barking. Prior to loading on 23 January 2020, the average\nresidual payload in each wagon was about 6.6 tonnes and the maximum was\n13.5 tonnes.\n\n125 The wagons were loaded at Barking using a 360° excavator with a weighing\nfacility, working from the right-hand side of the train. This method of loading, and\nthe nature of the clayey material involved, contributed to the payload in every\nwagon being off-set towards the right-hand side when the train left Barking on\n23 January. Wagon 3415 did not exceed the maximum gross vehicle weight,\nbut the load was concentrated towards the rear right corner of the wagon. The\nload on the leading and trailing wheelsets on the trailing bogie weighed 26.4\ntonnes and 25.95 tonnes respectively, both exceeding the 25.4 tonne RA10 limit\n(paragraph 56). In addition, the payload was off-set so that the two right-hand\nwheels on this bogie were carrying over 6 tonnes more than the left-hand wheels\nwith a maximum wheel load of 14.9 tonnes, which can be compared to the\n12.7 tonnes carried if the maximum permitted vehicle load is distributed equally\nbetween all wagon wheels (figure 44). The maximum wheel load is also defined\nby Railway Group Standard GMRT2141 ‘Permissible track forces and resistance\nto derailment and roll-over of railway vehicles’ as not exceeding 124.5 KN.

Unbalanced wagons change the ride\ncharacteristics of a wagon and are likely to have a greater propensity to derail.\nAs a general rule the more evenly loaded from side to side and end to end the\nlower the risk.\nThe side to side placement of the load should be controlled and monitored... In\npractice parties should target for balanced loading and manage their activities to\nreduce the potential inadvertent bias generated from loading activities. This can\nbe achieved by monitoring the performance of their activities (visual or weights\nrecorded) and providing feedback to the staff undertaking the load placement,\nidentifying actions to be taken. The load placement process may require\nredesign if staff are unable to adjust loading to within the parameters. ’\n\n127 RAIB has also analysed wagon loading data for the three preceding journeys. On\nthree of the four occasions including 23 January, all wagons were more heavily\nloaded on the right-hand side. The recorded weight exceeded 12.7 tonnes for\n89% of the wheels on the right-hand side of the train on 23 January. Over the four\njourneys, the average was 80%.\n\n128 The magnitude of the payload and its unevenness would have affected the\nvertical loads on the bogie pivot assembly and the side bearers and, as a result,\nthe horizontal friction forces acting at each of the various associated contact\npoints and surfaces.

The two-day course\nwas intended to be entirely classroom-based and the syllabus did not include any\npractical elements. There was no structured opportunity for delegates to look for\nrot, wear or damage, and there was no opportunity to practice testing techniques\nsuch as assessing the internal condition of timber by taking drill samples and\nsounding with a hammer (listening to the noise made when striking the timber\nwith a hammer). The training was not specific on where or how inspectors should\ndrill into timbers to detect decay.\n\n133 Inspectors are required to assess the remaining life of the timbers, but this is a\nvery subjective assessment - not easy to teach without practical elements, and\ndependent on variables including the amount of rail traffic, wheel loadings and\ntrack geometry. The training course included advice on looking for visual signs\nof failure starting, although these can be hard to identify in softwood such as the\nDouglas Fir used on bridge 456. Assessing the remaining life of a softwood timber\nwas not specifically covered by the training. Some assets, such as earthworks,\nuse a scoring system to assess asset condition, but there is no similar system for\nlongitudinal timber inspections.\n\n134 Delegates were instructed that they should obtain and review background\ninformation, including recent track recording vehicle traces, prior to an inspection.\n\n135 The training course referred to use of the TEF3014 form (paragraph 98), but there\nwas no guidance on how to complete the form and no guidance on whether the\ntimber grading (Good/Fair/Poor) should apply to the whole timber or to its worst\npart. The course did not refer to the importance of completing the comments and\nrecommendations section of the report to guide those responsible for reviewing it.\n\n136 The techniques available to Network Rail timber inspectors seeking to determine\nthe internal condition of timbers were limited to sounding with a hammer and\ntaking drill samples. For timbers of this size, the effectiveness of a hammer test\nis limited, as a timber that made a hollow sound when hit would already be in an\nunsafe condition.\n\n137 The drill provided to inspectors formed relatively large holes with the potential\nto introduce water, and so encourage rot, in the inner parts of timbers. Standard\nNR/L2/TRK/3038 (issue 6) therefore limited the use of drills to instances where\nthere were signs of deterioration or other grounds to suspect decay of the timber.\nAs demonstrated at bridge 456, timbers appearing to be in good condition can\nhave a good surface concealing a rotten core (paragraph 67).\n\n138 The timber specialist commissioned by RAIB to inspect timbers from bridge 456\n(paragraphs 62 and 66) concluded that the internal decay in timbers 1L and 2L\nshould have been detected by an effective inspection regime. The training given\nto longitudinal timber inspectors and the techniques available to them when\nundertaking inspections were likely to be insufficient to achieve this.\n\nReport 12/2020 44 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "139 VTG's processes did not recognise an underlying problem with wagon 疡\n3415 despite the unusual distribution and rate of flange wear on some of its 2\nwheelsets. <\n\n140 The need for frequent replacement of some wheelsets on wagon 3415 and the\nnature of wheel wear on the trailing bogie provided VTG with an opportunity to\nrecognise a problem requiring consideration as a possible safety issue. However,\nthe problem was not identified and so VTG did not consider the underlying cause\nand its possible implications for safety.\n\n141 VTG stated that it did not have any specific process for monitoring or identifying\nunusual wheel wear patterns. Instead, it relied on the vigilance of the\norganisations responsible for maintaining the wagons or supplying the wheelsets\nto identify wear patterns which might indicate a significant geometry fault. VTG\nprovided records of wear patterns for wheelsets fitted to other wagons in the\nsame train, and RAIB found no other examples of wheel wear occurring as rapidly\nas on wagon 3415.\n\n142 VTG also stated that uneven wheel flange wear can occur on wagons fitted with\n3-piece bogies, such as those fitted to wagon 3415. The wear often occurs when\nthe bogie needs to steer on sections of track with small radius curves and no\nflange lubrication, such as in sidings. Spilt sand and aggregates collecting on the\ntrack in loading areas can also contribute by grinding the wheelset flanges against\nthe rails.\n\n143 Although uneven wheel flange wear is not unusual, significant wear on two\nwheels on the same side of a bogie does appear to be so. Wheel wear data\nprovided by VTG for most of the other wagons on the train, measured following\nthe accident, showed a variation in flange wear of up to 3 mm when other wheels\non the same wheelset were compared. However, only wagon 3415 exhibited rapid\nflange wear on the same side of both wheelsets on the same bogie.\n\nObservation\n\n144 Three wagons on train 6254 exceeded the maximum permitted weight.\n\n145 Wagon wheel weights measured after loading on 23 January 2020\n(paragraph 125) were used by loading staff to calculate the total weight of the\ntrain, and this weight was passed to a member of DB Cargo staff at Barking. They\ninformed the DB Cargo TOPS office by phone who entered the train’s details\ninto TOPS (Total Operations Processing System) which is operated by Network\nRail for purposes including assisting management and recording freight train\noperations. TOPS carried out some checks before providing output indicating that\nthe train was permitted to leave the loading facility. As only the total train weight\nhad been provided, TOPS calculated the average weight per wagon, checked that\nthis was within the permitted limit, and released the train for departure.\n\nReport 12/2020 45 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "> 146 On 23 January, train 6254 departed from Barking with a total gross weight of\n\n全 2167 tonnes excluding the locomotive. The maximum theoretical weight for the\n\n要 22 wagons of train 6Z54, each at the maximum permitted weight of 101.6 tonnes,\nwas 2235 tonnes and TOPS released the train on this basis. However, the train\nwas released with three overweight wagons. These were wagons 3114 and 3125\npositioned directly behind wagon 3415. These weighed 105 tonnes and 105.45\ntonnes respectively, with the weight concentrated towards the trailing bogie in\nboth cases (figure 44). The other overloaded wagon was the fourth in the train\nand weighed 102.35 tonnes. All three overloaded wagons were of the JXA type\nwhich are larger vehicles (paragraph 17) and therefore may have appeared to\nbe less full. These three wagons were each carrying a residual payload of at\nleast 10 tonnes on arrival at Barking (paragraph 124). Despite only three wagons\nexceeding the 101.6 tonnes gross weight limit for RA10, uneven loading meant\nthat 24 of the 88 individual axles (27%) had loads in excess of 25.4 tonnes,\nand 82 of the 176 individual wheels (46%) had loads in excess of 12.7 tonnes\n(paragraph 125).\n\n147 An alternative way to enter train data into the TOPS system, is to input the total\nweight of each individual wagon. Had this been done on 23 January 2020, TOPS\nwould have prevented the train from being released because three wagons\nexceeded the maximum permitted weight of 101.6 tonnes (paragraph 18). The\ntotal weight of wagon 3415 was 100.15 tonnes and was not sufficient for TOPS to\nprevent the train commencing its journey. Network Rail has stated that it does not\nmandate that weighbridge weights for each wagon are entered into TOPS, but if\noverloading is identified, the wagons should be returned to the terminal to allow\nproduct to be removed.\n\n148 For the journeys on 18, 21 and 22 January, only one wagon in each train\nexceeded the 101.6 tonne gross laden weight limit. However, uneven loading\nmeant that an average of 26% of individual axles exceeded the 25.4 tonne\nmaximum axle weight limit (paragraph 56).\n\nPrevious occurrences of a similar character\n\nDerailment of a freight train at Bexley, 4 February 1997\n\n149 A freight train derailed on Bridge 799, immediately east of Bexley station in\nsouth-east London, because of lateral movement of the track on the longitudinal\ntimbers on the bridge and a resultant widening of the track gauge. The derailment\nresulted in substantial damage to the viaduct carrying the track. Four members of\nthe public who were working in or near the arches under the viaduct were injured.\n\n150 The investigation by HM Railway Inspectorate® found that the 12\" wagon in the\ntrain was substantially overloaded. It derailed but remained upright. This resulted\nin the forces exerted on the track being on average larger than normal. The train\nwas travelling in excess of the speed limit specified for freight trains on the route.\nThe investigation also found that the longitudinal timbers of the bridge were\nseverely decayed and overdue for replacement.\n\n8 https://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=179.\n\nReport 12/2020 46 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

Track maintenance was not sufficient to prevent the condition of the\ntrack deteriorating over time. A computer simulation study, undertaken as part of\nthe RAIB investigation, demonstrated the influence that the leading wheelsets\nhad on the gauge presented to the following wheelsets. It showed that, on track\nhaving poor rail-sleeper lateral restraint, preceding wheelsets progressively widen\nthe gauge. It also showed how increased flexibility led to increased spreading\nforce and hence to progressive rail fixing damage which resulted in more spread.\n\nDerailment at Angerstein Junction, 2 April 2014 (RAIB Report 11/2015)\n\n152 Two wagons of a nominally empty freight train derailed on the approach to\nAngerstein Junction, near Charlton in south-east London. The wagons derailed\nbecause the leading right-hand wheel on one of them was carrying insufficient\nload to prevent the wheel climbing up the outer rail on a curved section of track.\nThe insufficient load was due to a combination of a track defect, an unevenly\ndistributed residual payload in the wagon, and an uneven distribution of load\nassociated with a twisted bogie.\n\nDerailment at Washwood Heath West Junction, Birmingam, 23 March 2015 (RAIB\n\nReport 01/2016)\n\n153 One bogie of a wagon in a container train derailed on a set of points as it crossed\nbetween lines at Washwood Heath West Junction, in Birmingham. The bogie\nran derailed for 121 metres before rerailing itself as it ran through another set of\npoints. The track contained a twist fault of a magnitude which Network Rail’s track\nmaintenance standard specified should be rectified within 36 hours. Network Rail\nwas not aware of the existence of this fault at the time.\n\n154 Wagons should be capable of negotiating a track twist of a magnitude which the\ntrack standard allows to remain in a line open to traffic. When examined after the\nderailment, the liner on the centre pivot of the bogie was found to be worn beyond\nits maintenance limit. The centre pivot liner is made from a plastic material and\nis provided to allow relative movement between the body centre pivot and the\nbogie. The worn liner had restricted the freedom of the bogie to rotate, increasing\nits rotational stiffness. Furthermore, it resulted in reduced side bearer clearances,\nincreasing wheel unloading in track twist conditions. Both the increased rotational\nstiffness and the increased wheel unloading reduced the wagon’s resistance to\nderailment, causing it to derail when it encountered the track twist on the curved\ntrack. The worn centre pivot liner had not been identified during maintenance of\nthe wagon as the maintenance instructions were unclear about when it should be\ninspected. A check on other wagons in the same fleet revealed that a number of\nother wagons of the same type had experienced a similar degree of centre pivot\nliner wear.\n\nReport 12/2020 47 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

The first of the wagons ran derailed, damaging the track,\nthen overturned spilling its payload of sand. The RAIB investigation found that\nthe derailment occurred because this wagon, which was probably carrying an\nuneven payload, encountered a significant track twist on tightly curved track. This\nresulted in there being insufficient wheel load to prevent its flange climbing over\nthe railhead.\n\nFailure of a longitudinal timber at bridge 2013, Haringey, August 2017\n\n156 Part of a longitudinal timber from bridge 2013 (St Ann’s Road) in Haringey, north\nLondon, fell onto the pavement of the street below on another part of the Barking\nto Gospel Oak route. On this bridge, the longitudinal timbers span between\ncross-girders but without a metal deck, so the underside of the timbers is visible\nfrom beneath the bridge. A member of the public reported the incident to the\npolice. There were no injuries.\n\n157 The longitudinal timbers on this bridge had already been identified as being in\nneed of renewal, but as this was a relatively long bridge, the work was repeatedly\ndeferred due to shortcomings with the arrangements for planning and funding\nthe work. RAIB undertook a preliminary examination, but as the incident did not\nappear to be directly associated with the movement of a train, it did not undertake\na full investigation. However, RAIB highlighted its concerns in a letter to Network\nRail and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) (Appendix C).\n\n158 A Network Rail internal investigation found that the affected softwood timber\nhad rotted internally to the heartwood, which crushed under load resulting in\nthe section of wood detaching. The investigation also found that the route asset\nmanager was not informed that the timber required renewal and that detailed\nknowledge of work needing to be done was lost due to the departure of staff.\n\n159 ORR carried out an intervention and in November 2018, issued a Special\nTrack Inspections Intervention Report to Network Rail which addressed the\nmanagement of longitudinal timbers on Anglia route, including factors relating to\nthe incident at bridge 2013. The review found that the route conducted no formal\nanalysis of inspection information to see trends. The report recommended that the\nroute should define in more detail exactly when and where drill samples should be\ntaken and when a hammer should be used for sounding.\n\nReport 12/2020 48 November 2020\n\nWanstead Park",

A large\npiece of timber was found under the bridge by a member of the public (figure 1), and was\nreported to Network Rail by the Metropolitan Police. The wood was part of an unsupported\nlongitudinal timber (ie there was no supporting deck plate) carrying the 6 foot rail of the up line\nwhich had rotted. Network Rail staff initially imposed a 5 mph emergency speed restriction, but\nthe line was later blocked when track maintenance staff determined that the timber had to be\nrenewed. The remaining section of the timber was found to have rotted through from the top\nand it disintegrated as it was being removed from the bridge on 28 August (figure 2). Sections\nexamined by the RAIB on 30 August were found to be spongy and wet.\n\nSa oe ee © oe = Leg\n\noe a Ce © Se .

The line is currently being\nelectrified, which will allow an improved passenger service and an increase in the number of\nfreight paths available to access the London Gateway container port on the Thames east of\nTilbury. Project works have included renewal of four bridges and modernisation of six others,\nbut the route has still has numerous underbridges with longitudinal timber track support\nsystems.\nReport 12/2020 58 November 2020\nWanstead Park",

      "text": "The current longitudinal timbers on bridge 2013 were installed in about 1986 with a 20 year #\nservice life. By 2012, their condition had deteriorated to the extent that the Barking Track 2\nMaintenance Engineer proposed that the timbers be renewed.\nLongitudinal timber systems, because of their vulnerability, are subject to annual inspections in <\naccordance with Network Rail standard NR/L2/TRK/3038. The last three TEF3014 long timber\nexamination reports for this bridge have marked the timbers as ‘red’, meaning replacement\nrequired in 1-12 months. The length of the bridge meant that this activity exceeded the\ncapability of the local delivery unit and required funding from the CAPEX budget. The RAIB\nunderstands that, prior to the incident, this renewal work was planned for 2019.\nPrior to the line reopening after an eight month electrification blockade in February 2017, the\nnewly-appointed Infrastructure Maintenance engineer (IME) sent an email to the RAM [Track]\nproposing that advantage be taken of the blockade to gain access and renew timbers. The\nRAM [Track] did not take the proposal forward, apparently due to budget constraints. The line\nreopened with tie bars fitted and a 20 mph emergency speed restriction. The poor condition\nof the longitudinal timbers is illustrated in a photograph dated January 2017 (figure 3) which\nshows the disintegration of the top surface.\nf ai oe ‘ \\ wad\nPhoto 8 Timber whee! bases showing signs of rot - 24/01/17 a 一 上 六 1\nFigure 3: photograph dated January 2017 Figure 4: damaged timber from below. Daylight is\nvisible.\nA structures visual examination report dated March 2017 identified that urgent attention\nwas required to replace the severely decayed wheel-timbers. This concern was raised by\nthe examiner even though longitudinal timbers are not deemed a structures asset. The IME\nforwarded a copy of this report to the RAM [Track] to reinforce his request that action be\ntaken. The most recent supervisor's inspection in August 2017 also categorised the affected\ntimber as ‘poor’.\nIt is apparent that numerous warnings were raised about the deterioration of the longitudinal\ntimbers on this bridge. In view of the similarities with the 1997 Bexley derailment which was\ncaused by significant deterioration to the track support and fastenings, | would like to draw\nyour attention to the following aspects of this event:\n1. The RAM [Track] did not approve work to renew the longitudinal timbers. The RAIB has\nnot sought to establish why, but observes that as the longitudinal timbers on bridge 2013\nwere un-supported (ie there was no deck plate beneath the timbers - figure 4), so were\nrequired to have the strength necessary to carry and transfer rail traffic loading to the\nsupporting structure.\n2. Areview, required by standard NR/L2/TRK/3038 when the tonnage of traffic using a\nlongitudinal timber bridge was expected to increase significantly, either did not occur, or\ndid not identify that work was urgently required.\nReport 12/2020 59 November 2020\nWanstead Park",

This is surprising,\na as the scope of the project included bridgeworks elsewhere on the line.\n8 The RAIB has decided to take no further action in respect of this incident. However given\nthe apparent safety management issues it raises, we advise Network Rail to take the above\npoints into account when concluding their own investigation and developing recommendations\nto prevent a reoccurrence. | am copying this letter to the Office of Rail and Road for their\ninformation.\nYours sincerely,\nDeputy Chief Inspector of Rail Accidents\nCopy to:\nOffice of Rail and Road,\n1 Kemble Street,\nLondon\nWC2B 4AN\nReport 12/2020 60 November 2020\nWanstead Park",
