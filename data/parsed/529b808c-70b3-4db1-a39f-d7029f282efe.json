      "text": "1. Why do Railways have a Signalling System\nThere are two fundamental physical reasons why railway signalling systems exist:\n1. Trains are guided by the track and hence have to be routed in such a way as to avoid collisions with\none another\n2. Trains cannot stop within the distance that the driver can see — they need to have prior warning of\nthe need to slow down and stop ahead\n2. Signalling System Basics\n2.1 Basic Principles\nThe basis principle underpinning all UK signalling systems is the Block System.\nEach line is divided into Block Sections, and except in particular circumstances only one train is permitted to\nbe in each block section at any one time.\nA signal is provided at the start and end of each block section to allow the train to enter and exit the block.\n2.2 Functions of a Signalling System\nBased upon this simple principle, signalling systems have evolved to provide the following key functions:\nSafety Functions:\n¢ To prevent trains taking conflicting routes\n¢ To maintain a safe separation distance between trains\n¢ To protect trains from driver malfunction (incapacity / inattention / misjudgement)\n¢ To ensure trains do not exceed their permitted speed\nNon Safety Functions:\n¢ To maximise the use of the track\n¢ To route trains automatically and regulate their flow\n¢ To provide data on train running for passenger information purposes\nNot all functions are provided at all locations\n3. Generations of Signalling Systems\nWithin the UK there are three generations of signalling system in use or planned:\n¢ Mechanical Signalling - is basically 1860’s technology, but there is much of it still in use especially on\nregional lines\n¢ Multiple Aspect Signalling — is the predominant generation of signalling in use, and covers virtually\nall main lines in the UK. Its use began in the 1930’s and after a pause for World War 2 was rolled out\nover much of the network in the 1960s, 70s and 80’s. It is still being installed, albeit with more\nmodern technology.\nPrepared by Neil Porter Page 1 of 8 Introduction to Railway Signalling\nv1.0_Additional reading.docx",

      "text": "Introduction to Railway Signalling\n¢ Cab Signalling — Signals are dispensed with and instructions to the driver are displayed in his cab.\nThis is the next generation of signalling based on ETCS.\nHybrid systems also exist.\nIn the case of mechanical and multiple aspect signalling, the driver is required to “know” the route he is\ntravelling and therefore the speed restrictions (including at junctions), and the signal aspects provide him\nwith specific routing information.\n4. Mechanical Signalling\nMechanical signalling developed in the mid 1800’s. The signalman operates large mechanical levers in a\nsmall wayside signalbox to change the state of individual points and signals. The lever frame in which the\nlevers are mounted incorporates mechanical interlocking, such that individual levers can only be operated\nwhen other levers are in the correct position. The levers are connected to the signals and points by means of\nmechanical connections of rods or wires.\nSignals are of the semaphore type, and consist of two key types: |\nStop signals — the driver has to stop at these if the signal arm is horizontal (at danger). If it\nis raised (or sometimes lowered) by approx 60 degrees, then this gives the driver\npermission to proceed beyond the signal (into the next block section)\nDistant signals — if the arm of these is horizontal, it advises the driver that the next stop >\nsignal is at danger, and he must slow to stop at it. If it is raised (or sometimes lowered) by\napprox 60 degrees, then it advises the driver that all the stop signals ahead controlled from\nthis signalbox are clear, and that he can proceed at the speed of the line. Distant signals are\npositioned at least braking distance from the next stop signal.\nA typical mechanically signalled layout is illustrated below:\nBraking distance TTT TT\n—_——— Block section to next signalbox\n= Braking distance =\nIYVK—K\neT\nBlock section to next signalbox\nAt diverging junctions, indications of route to the driver are provided by mounting multiple stop arms on a\nsingle post.\nPrepared by Neil Porter Page 2 of 8 Introduction to Railway Signalling\nv1.0_Additional reading.docx",

Multiple Aspect Signalling\nMultiple aspect signalling was a development designed both to increase the train carrying capacity of the\ntrack and to enable a single signaller to control a much larger geographical area, since he is not restricted by\nmechanical rods and wires to be in close proximity to the signals and points.\nThe functional of mechanical stop and distant signals are combined into a single colour light signal with three\nor four aspects.\n¢ <Ared light requires the driver to stop\n¢ A single yellow advises him that the next signal is at red, and therefore to slow\nappropriately\n¢ A double yellow advises him that the next signal is at yellow, and hence the one\nbeyond that is at red, and therefore to slow appropriately\n¢ Agreen advises him to proceed at linespeed\nA typical sequence of aspects as trains proceed along the line is illustrated below:\nBlock Section\n~<a |\n本 | 人\nBraking distance\n<« ad\nHeadway between following trains\nAt diverging junctions, indications of route to the driver are provided by adding junction indicators above the\nsignal, which is lit in addition to the main aspect when a diverging route is set.\nPrepared by Neil Porter Page 3 of 8 Introduction to Railway Signalling\nv1.0_Additional reading.docx",

Components of a Signalling System\nThe following section highlights the key elements of the signalling system.\n6.1 Train detection\nThe function of a train detection sub system is to determine if a particular section of track is occupied by a\ntrain.\n6.1.1 Manual Detection\nWith the original mechanical signalling systems the only form of train detection was manual observation by\nthe signaller looking out of the signalbox window.\n6.1.2 Track Circuits\nTo protect against human error, track circuits were developed, which use insulated sections of the rails as an\nelectrical circuit, which the wheels of a train shunts as it enters the section.\nConceptually a track circuit is represented thus:\nInsulated Insulated\nrail joints == rail joints\nTransmitter Detector\nIn the simplest form the transmitter is a battery and the detector is an electro-mechanical relay.\nMany much more sophisticated types exist using coded audio signals and frequency shift keying (FSK),\nwhich were developed to provide immunity from EMI generated by electric trains.\nThe track circuit illustrates the key principle of “Fail Safe” applied to all traditional signalling equipment, in\nthat any break in the circuit between the transmitter and the receiver has the same functional effect as a train\nshunting the rails, and hence the system fails to a safe state.\nIn Multiple Aspect Signalling installations, large numbers of individual track circuits cover the entire track\nlayout to provide complete train detection.\nPrepared by Neil Porter Page 4 of 8 Introduction to Railway Signalling\nv1.0_Additional reading.docx",

If so to control signalling outputs in\naccord with the signaller’s request.\n6.4.1 Mechanical Interlocking\nMechanical interlocking in a mechanical signalbox consists of a series of steel bars and tappets connected to\nthe levers, which prevent unsafe combinations of levers being pulled by the signaller. These are still common\non rural lines, but rely for some of their safety integrity on the signaller.\n6.4.2 Relay based Interlocking\nThese were developed from the 1930’s onwards, and reached their peak of development in the 1960’s / 70’s.\nHere the interlocking functions are provided by very large numbers of electro-mechanical relays, drawn from\na range of relays specifically designed to operate in a highly reliable fail safe nature.\nThe required functionality at a particular location is literally hard wired between the relays.\n6.4.3 Computer based Interlocking\nThere are a number of types in operation in the UK, but the most widely used is known as SSI (Solid State\nInterlocking) and was developed by BR in the 1980's. It is based upon an 8 bit microprocessor, and achieves\nits safety integrity by operating 3 processors in parallel, of which at least 2 have to agree on a change of\noutput before it is put into effect.\nThe interlocking communicates with individual points and signals by means of a duplicated serial data link,\nwith complex data coding, which interfaces with a TFM (Trackside Functional Module) to provide parallel\ninput and outputs at an appropriate power level for individual signal and points.\nThe required functionality at a particular location is entered as configuration data, and is produced in a\nbespoke language and then compiled.\nOther computer based interlockings are in use, including:\n¢ Interlockings developed in mainland Europe and customised for UK application\n¢ Successor interlockings to SSI which operate in a very similar manner but on a more modern\nhardware platform\n6.5 AWS LO aE\noo 7:\nAutomatic Warning System was developed in the 1950’s to ee FS — 有 ore\nprovide the driver with warning of a signal which was not at i oe >. ae\ngreen.

Thus with the two\nloops together a train passing the signal is stopped. This pair of loops is known as the “Train Stop”.\nA second pair of loops are located a few hundred metres on the approach to the signal, and are separated\nby a pre determined distance. A train passing over these loops above a preset speed (determined by their\nseparation) will also be triggered and bought to a stand. This pair of loops is known at the “Overspeed Trap”\nThe speed setting is designed to be above that which a train should be travelling to safely stop at the signal.\nThe photograph shows a single TPWS loop.\n6.7 Signalbox control and display systems\nThere are two key types of signalbox display systems, ignoring mechanical signalling, where the display\nsystem is broadly to look out of the window!\n6.7.1 Panels\nThese consist of a mimic of the track layout, usually etched onto small metal tiles. The signaller can control\nthe signals / points etc by means of individual buttons and switches, and is provided with information on the\nstate of the system by means of illuminated displays within the panel.\nThere are many panel signalboxes in use in the UK covering hundreds of route miles each.\n6.7.2 VDU based displays\nThese are a logical extension of panels, but utilise VDU technology to provide the same and sometimes\nenhanced information. The signallers control interface is via a keyboard and mouse. This is the predominant\nform of control and display system for new signalling systems.\n6.8 Ancillary items\nThe key components of the traditional signalling system have been dealt with above; the following are a\nsmall subset of the remainder.\n\nPrepared by Neil Porter Page 7 of 8 Introduction to Railway Signalling\n\nv1.0_Additional reading.docx",
