      "text": "Introduction\n[This introduction is not part of IEEE Std 1474.1-2004, IEEE Standard for Communications-Based Train Control\n(CBTC) Performance and Functional Requirements. ]\nThis introduction provides some background on the rationale used to develop this standard. This information\nis meant to aid in the understanding, usage, and applicability of this standard.\nConventional signaling/train control systems rely almost exclusively on track circuits to detect the presence\nof trains. Information on the status of the track ahead is provided to train operators either through wayside\nsignals or train-borne cab signals. Ensuring compliance with the signals is achieved through operating\nprocedures, wayside automatic train stops, or train-borne supervisory equipment linked to the train’s braking\nsystem. These conventional systems are effective in providing train protection, but are not particularly\nefficient in maximizing the utilization of the rail transit infrastructure, as a result of a number of fundamental\nlimitations, specifically, the following:\n\na) The location of trains can only be determined to the resolution of the track circuits; if any part of a\ntrack circuit is occupied by a train, the whole track circuit must be assumed to be occupied by the\ntrain. Track circuits can be made shorter, but each additional track circuit requires additional way-\nside hardware, so there is an economical and practical limit to the number of track circuits that can\nbe provided.\n\nb) The information that can be provided to a train is limited to a small number of wayside signal\naspects or a small number of speed codes in a cab signal system.\n\nc) For a wayside signal system with automatic train stops but without continuous cab signaling,\nenforcement is intermittent.\n\nCBTC systems overcome these fundamental limitations of conventional track circuit-based systems, and\ntherefore, permit more effective utilization of the transit infrastructure. This is accomplished, for example,\nby allowing trains to operate safely at much closer headways, by permitting greater flexibility and greater\nprecision in train control, and by providing continuous safe train separation assurance and overspeed protec-\ntion. Additional benefits of CBTC technology include the economical support of automatic train operations\n(both on the mainline and in maintenance yards), improved reliability, and reductions in maintenance costs\nthrough a reduction in wayside equipment and real-time diagnostic information. The basic characteristics of\na CBTC system include the following:\n\n1) Determination of train location, to a high degree of precision, independent of track circuits.\n\n2) A geographically continuous train-to-wayside and wayside-to-train data communications network to\npermit the transfer of significantly more control and status information than is possible with conven-\ntional systems.\n\n3) Wayside and train-borne vital processors to process the train status and control data and provide\ncontinuous automatic train protection (ATP). Automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train\nsupervision (ATS) functions can also be provided, as required by the particular application.\n\nAlthough the benefits of CBTC technology are recognized, there are currently no independent standards\ndefining the performance and functional requirements that need to be satisfied by CBTC systems in order to\nrealize enhanced performance, availability, train operational flexibility, and train protection. This standard\nhas been developed to address this.\n\nIV Copyright © 2005 IEEE. All rights reserved.",

Performance requirements\n\n5.1 CBTC factors contributing to achievable headways\n\nThe required design and operating headways (i.e., the minimum and scheduled headways) for both normal\nand reverse directions shall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. Headway may be specified as\nuninterfered and/or interfered.\n\nIn all cases, the design headway shall be constrained by the safe train separation requirements and the safe\nbraking model of 6.1.2.1.\n\nIn the case of an uninterfered headway, a train speed profile shall not be affected by a preceding train. All\ntrains shall, therefore, perform at the maximum allowed speed, depending on the civil speed limits and the\nacceleration and braking capabilities of the trains themselves.

Interfered headway may also be specified to support\nmultiple berthings at a station platform.\n\nThe design headway for a particular line and a particular set of vehicles involves many factors that are out-\nside the control of the CBTC system (e.g., track alignment, gradients, civil speed limits, train acceleration\nand braking rates, station dwell times, terminal track configurations, driver reaction times). These factors\nshall be specified by the authority having jurisdiction. This standard addresses only those CBTC factors con-\ntributing to achievable headways, of which the most significant are the following:\n\na) Location (both accuracy of measured end-of-train locations and resolution of movement authority\nlimits for a given train), including the frequency at which location reports and movement authorities\nare updated.\n\nb) Speed, including both accuracy of speed measurement and resolution of speed limits established for\na given train at a given location.\n\nc) Communications delays, including nominal and worst-case transmission times of command/status\nmessages between wayside and train, and vice versa. (Command/status messages include, for\nexample, messages related to movement authority updates and/or location report updates.)\n\nd) CBTC equipment reaction times, including maximum error accumulation, for both wayside and\ntrain-borne equipment, and for various operating modes, as applicable. (CBTC equipment reaction\ntimes include, for example, the time required to establish new movement authority limits following\nlocation report updates, the time to establish new movement authority limits through an\ninterlocking, and the time to determine a new ATP profile following movement authority update.)\n\ne) CBTC system performance limitations (e.g., the maximum number of trains that can be processed\nby the CBTC system, within a given area of control).\n\nf) |CBTC automatic speed regulation algorithm.\n\n10 Copyright © 2005 IEEE.

This subclause establishes qualitative availability, reliability, and maintainability criteria for\nCBTC systems and equipment in order to meet or exceed the on-time performance and fleet availability\nobjectives of the authority having jurisdiction, and thereby minimize delays experienced by passengers. In\naddressing CBTC equipment failures, a distinction shall be made between the following failure types:\n\na) Type 1: Those failures, or combination of failures, that impact on-time performance of the transit\nsystem.\n\nb) Type 2: Those failures, or combination of failures, that do not impact on-time performance of the\ntransit system, but do result in some other loss of specified CBTC functionality.\n\nc) Type 3: Those failures that do not impact on-time performance of the transit system or result in a\nloss of any specified CBTC functionality (e.g., because of equipment redundancy).\n\nThe CBTC system availability requirement (see 5.4.2) shall include consideration of all Type 1 failures, as\nwell as the mean time to restore service (MTTRS) for Type 1 failures.\n\nThe CBTC system mean time between functional failure (MTBFF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include\nconsideration of all Type 1 and Type 2 failures.\n\nThe CBTC system mean time between failure (MTBF) requirement (see 5.4.3) shall include consideration of\nall Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 failures.\n\nWhile system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF predictions traditionally consider only hard-\nware failures, measurements of achieved system availability, system MTBFF, and system MTBF shall also\nconsider software errors (i.e., software fails to perform intended function) as well as hardware failures.\n\nThe following general recommended practices apply:\n\n1) Components and materials should be selected and appropriate standards of quality control and test\nprocedures should be employed to ensure the lowest practical hardware failure rates for individual\nitems of CBTC equipment (i.e., maximize the hardware portion of the system MTBF).\n\n2) Unless non-redundant equipment is sufficiently reliable to satisfy the overall system availability\nrequirements, appropriate levels of equipment redundancy should be employed such that the failure\nof a single component, processor, or device will not render the CBTC system unavailable or an oper-\nationally critical function nonoperative (i.e., maximize the system MTBFF).\n\n3) A CBTC system should incorporate degraded modes of operation to minimize the operational\nimpacts of equipment failures and to permit train movements to continue safely (1.e., maximize sys-\ntem availability).\n\n4) CBTC system downtime or unavailability of an operationally critical function should be minimized\nthrough the use of local and remote diagnostic capabilities and appropriate operating and mainte-\nnance procedures [i.e., minimize mean time to repair (MTTR)].\n\n5.4.2 System availability requirements\n\nQuantitative CBTC system availability requirements shall be established by the authority having jurisdiction\nwith appropriate consideration of the impacts of CBTC system and subsystem failures on the operation of\nthe transit system.

It should also be noted that the safe braking model\noutlined here is defined for level tangent track and would need to be adjusted for grades.\n\nIn Figure D.1, the emergency brake curve is the worst-case, open-loop, speed/distance curve a train will fol-\nlow once the ATP has initiated an emergency brake application. This emergency brake curve must always\nbe less than or equal to the safe speed curve, where safe speed is defined as the speed above which a critical\nhazard (derailment or collision) could occur.\n\nIn this model, safety factors are accounted for in the emergency brake curve, train position uncertainties, and\nother additional measurement tolerances incorporated in the CBTC system design, and there is no require-\nment to add additional safety margins.\n\nThe ATP overspeed detection curve is the speed-distance curve that the ATP subsystem uses to immediately\ninitiate an emergency brake application, if the ATP subsystem detects that the measured speed exceeds this\ncurve at the measured train location. When the ATP subsystem has initiated an emergency brake application,\nthe ATP subsystem is no longer in the control loop, and the train will emergency brake at or below the\nemergency brake curve. The emergency brake curve includes an initial propulsion runaway period, until\npropulsion is disabled.\n\nThe ATP profile curve is the speed-distance curve that is an ATP overspeed allowance below the ATP over-\nspeed detection curve. The ATP profile is the base curve used by the ATP subsystem.\n\nD.2 Train-borne CBTC response time (A)\n\nIn Figure D.1, it is assumed that the CBTC system will measure the train speed and train location (relative to\nits movement authority limit) and compare the measure speed with the ATP profile speed at that measure\nlocation, every A seconds (worst case).\n\nIn Figure D.1, point X represents the situation where the CBTC measured speed is just below the ATP over-\nspeed detection curve at the ATP measure location, i.e., although the ATP measured speed is above the ATP\nprofile, it is still within the ATP overspeed allowance. As such, the CBTC system will not initiate emer-\ngency braking.\n\nHowever, because of worst-case speed and location measurement errors (position uncertainty), it is possible\nthat the actual speed and actual location of the train could be a point Y.\n\nAt this point in time, although the train operator and/or ATO subsystem would normally be attempting to\nbring the train speed down to the ATP profile speed, it is assumed that a failure occurs that results in the\ntrain accelerating rather than braking.\n\n32 Copyright © 2005 IEEE.

In general, delay thresholds would be\nrelated to the operating headways, as delays at shorter headways impact on-time performance more\nsignificantly.\nThe CBTC system availability requirement may also consider other failure types, to the extent that such\nfailures impact fleet availability. For example, even if a train-borne CBTC equipment failure does not\nimmediately impact the on-time performance of the transit system, it may subsequently result in missed\nrevenue trips if the failure repair time results in the train being unavailable for service.\nWith this approach, the authority having jurisdiction would typically specify the following:\n\na) The quantitative CBTC system availability requirements\n\nb) The various delay thresholds and weighting factors\n\nc) The average travel times to be assumed for maintenance personnel to travel to the site of a failure\n\nd) The boundaries of the CBTC system covered by the availability requirements\n\ne) The type of CBTC failures to be included in defining the system availability\nFor a given CBTC system configuration, the predicted CBTC system availability could be determined\nthrough computer modeling from estimates of subsystem MTBFFs and MTTRs, and an assumed system\noperating plan.\nActual CBTC system availability could be determined from measurements of actual in-service delays, with\nappropriate adjustments for factors that are not included within the specified boundaries of the CBTC\nsystem.\nCopyright © 2005 IEEE.
