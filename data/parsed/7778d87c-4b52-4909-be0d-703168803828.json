The signalling must also deliver the train capacity required for the line.\nTherefore, the signalling of the track layout is critical.\n1. Purpose of Signalling and Functions\nThe key purposes of a signalling system are listed below. These include certain functions which were in\nthe past managed largely or entirely by procedure, but are now generally regarded as essential\nfunctions of the technical signalling system.\n“+ Setup a safe route for the passage of each train over the track that it is to traverse.\n«* Authorise the train to make the movement.\n“* Maintain the route while the train is making its movement.\n“¢ Supervise and/or enforce the train to stay within its movement authority.\n** Release the route (for use by other trains) after the passage of the train’.\nFunctions have been further added which may include:\ne The train driver (or ATO system) should be provided with appropriate information to control the\ntrain.\ne Sufficient space should be provided between following trains to allow each train to brake to a\nstand safely.\ne Controls should be in place to prevent or mitigate the consequences of:\nY Trains passing the end point of their movement authority.\nv Trains exceeding the maximum permitted speed.\nv¥ Trains moving without authorisation.\ne Protection should be provided for the public and trains at level (grade) crossings.\ne The means should be provided for protecting trains, worksites, and workers during engineering\nworks.\ne The signaller should be provided with appropriate information to enable the safe authorisation\nof train movements.\ne The system should have facilities to communicate between the signaller and others.\ne Means should be provided to prevent trains being signalled onto lines with which they are\nincompatible.\ne Facilities should be provided to instruct a train to stop in an emergency.\n2. Movement Authority\ne AMovement Authority (MA) is an authority communicated to the driver (or to the ATO system\ndriving the train) by the signalling system after it has checked that the section of line is clear\nand secure. This grants permission for a train to enter a particular section of\nline. Communication to the driver may be by means of lineside signals, or via an in-cab display\n(or sometimes both).\ne AMAwill have some limits associated with it, which may be:\nv Speed at which the movement may proceed.\n(“Speed” signalling systems favoured in many parts of continental Europe)\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 1 of 13",

      "text": "Institution of Railway Signal Engineers\nv Route and Distance to the end of the movement authority.\n(Route signalling systems — favoured in the UK and parts of the world historically\nclosely associated).\n\ne Traditionally a movement authority is communicated to a driver by means of a lineside signal\ndisplaying a “proceed” aspect with the end of a movement authority indicated by a red lineside\nsignal aspect.\n\ne The nature of the “proceed” aspect provides information about the limitations associated with\nthe movement authority. (“Speed” signalling or “Route” signalling). Except where the driver can\nalways see the end of movement authority from at least the braking distance (slow speeds and\ngood braking, start from rest) some form of restrictive (cautionary) aspect is necessary.\n\ne Certain MAs permit a train to enter a section of line that is already occupied by another train to\nallow trains to join, or to share platforms. The communication of these MAs to the driver\nincludes the fact that the line ahead is occupied. Otherwise train separation is important, see\nsection 3.\n\n3. Train Separation\nTo avoid collisions, it is essential to maintain a safe distance between trains. The most common\nmethods are described below.\n3.1 On-sight train control\nOn tramways and on certain railways there is little benefit in providing a comprehensive signalling\nsystem. Rail traffic speeds, frequency, and braking performance may be such that safe operation can\nrely on the driver being able to observe that the track ahead is clear.\n3.2 Fixed block working\nRailway lines are divided into “block sections” and in general only one train is permitted to occupy that\nsection of line at any one time. On low density lines a block section might be tens of kilometres,\nwhereas at the other extreme, on a very high-density metro line, a block section might be much less\nthan the length of a train.\nOne exception is that certain MAs permit a train to enter a section of line that is already occupied by\nanother train to allow trains to join, or to share platforms and sidings.\nLineside signals usually define the start and end of a block section and provide authority to enter the\nsection. Towards the end of a movement authority, lineside signals specify where to stop and also give\nadequate prior warning of this. Where signals are not provided, the movement authority and the\nremaining distance to its limit is given via some kind of in-cab display and/or an ATO (automatic train\noperation) system, or by a verbal instruction. The following safe separation methods are based on fixed\nblock working. For new projects, Absolute Block Working has been largely superseded by Track Circuit\nBlock working, which is now evolving into ETCS.\n\ne Absolute Block working: The signallers at the entrance and exit of the block section must follow\na strict procedure to authorise a train to enter the block section and to confirm that the complete\ntrain has left it (e.g. by observing the tail lamp on the back of the train). The length of block\nsections is dependent on spacing between signal boxes, which is often dictated by the distances\nbetween junctions, stations or level crossings. In most installations, electric block instruments are\nused. Typically, these are interlocked with signals and isolated train detection sections on\napproach to the signals at the exit of the block section to enforce elements of the absolute block\nworking regulations.\n\ne Track circuit block working: Track circuit block signalling is a development of absolute block\nsignalling where the line is divided into reasonably uniform, and often much shorter, blocks\nbetween adjacent stop signals, increasing the line capacity compared with absolute block\nsignalling. Only one train is permitted per block section, usually defined as between one stop signal\n\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 2 of 13",

Unlike\nCBTC systems, which are currently unique to each supplier, the ETCS is designed to be an\ninteroperable suite of products allowing trains to operate across borders without any country-specific\nequipment and for one supplier’s on-board equipment to work with a different supplier’s fixed\nsignalling.\nETCS specifies several different “levels” and variants, the most significant ones are:\n\ne Level 0 is used to refer to an ETCS fitted train using infrastructure not fitted with train protection or\nwhen operation in higher levels is not possible.\n\ne Level NTC is used by an ETCS fitted train when operating over a line which is only equipped with\nthe National Train Control system (Class B). Such systems in the UK are AWS/TPWS, in Germany\nLZB and in Belgium Crocodile/TBL.\n\ne Level 1 provides in-cab signalling and ATP (Automatic Train Protection) in conjunction with fixed\nblock lineside signalling including train detection. Data is passed to trains from\nswitchable/controlled balises, inductive loops, or possibly radio.\n\ne Level 2 provides fixed block signalling and in-cab displays with conventional train detection.\nCommunication is mostly through radio communication (GSM-R [Global System for Mobile\nCommunications — Railway]), with balises used for fixed information (such as absolute position).\nLineside signals are only required if used as a solution for migration, or for allowing non-ETCS\ntrains to run on the same lines.\n\ne Level 3 is a term which formally became obsolete in baseline 3 (which subsumed it into Level 2)\nbut is frequently still used to distinguish the circumstances in which conventional train detection is\nnot required because reliance is placed on the on-board position reporting and train integrity\nmonitoring. There are no lineside signals and moving block signalling is possible, although not\nnecessarily implemented.\n\n3.4 Moving Block working\n\nThe signalling system calculates the safe space between a train and the one it is following. This\nrequires continuous communication between the central signalling system and the On-Board system\nwhich supervises the train speed to maintain safety. The “blocks” are now a moving safe zone round\neach train; the length of the safe zone ahead of the following train depends on its speed, along with all\nthe other factors that affect its braking distance. Therefore, a following train can be allowed to approach\nvery close to the rear of a stationary preceding train (e.g. when it has stopped in a station) because its\nrequired braking distance decreases as its speed drops.\n\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 3 of 13",

Braking\n4.1 Significance of Braking\nA feature of railways is the low friction between steel rails and steel wheels; this has energy-saving\nadvantages but means long distances to stop are required due to the limited adhesion. This can cause\nslips (as the train accelerates) and slides (as the train decelerates) which is a factor that onboard\nCBTC/ETCS needs to take into account (uncertainty is shown yellow in Fig 2).\nTrains can also be extremely heavy and/or travel at considerable speeds; a moving train therefore has\nsignificant momentum and there is a lot of kinetic energy to convert to other forms of energy during the\nprocess of stopping a train.\nHence, Braking Distance (BD) (i.e. the distance required for a train to brake to a stand from its highest\npermissible speed at that position) is an important consideration within the design of a railway system to\nrealise the key requirement: “Sufficient space should be provided between following trains to allow each\ntrain to brake to a stand safely”.\nEssentially this means that the signalling system has to communicate to the driver (or entity driving the\ntrain) that they are approaching the end of their movement authority in sufficient time and distance to\nenable the train to brake safely before it in all circumstances.\nThis can be achieved by:\n\ne Lineside signal aspects — (giving cautionary signal aspects- with speed or distance meaning).\n\ne In cab displays - (reflecting a braking curve- with speed or distance meaning).\n\ne Communication with an ATO system.\n\n4.1.1 Factors affecting Braking Distance:\nBraking distance depends upon:\n\ne Permitted speed of the train at the place that braking commences.\n\ne Braking rate of train (The braking performance of trains on a particular route is a key defined\ninterface between the rolling stock system and the signalling system).\n\ne Likely adhesion conditions between the train wheel and the rail (affected by weather or oil\ncontamination that might cause slip/slide).\n\ne The likely reaction time of the driver.\n\ne Brake build-up delay, i.e. the time during which the brakes gradually become increasingly\neffective after having been initiated by the driver (this depends on the design of the braking\nsystem, the length of the train and is a particularly relevant factor for long freight trains).\n\ne Effect of a rising or falling gradient on the effective braking rate. Clearly, a train travelling on a\nrising gradient will be able to stop in a shorter distance and conversely will take a longer\ndistance on a falling gradient.\n\ne Train achieving specified performance throughout its life (wear & tear, some brakes potentially\nisolated).\n\ne The comfort of passengers.\n\nThe braking distance of a train in normal operation, taking into account all these factors is usually\nreferred to as a Service Braking Distance (SBD), whereas a train making an Emergency Brake\napplication would generally be able to stop in a significantly shorter distance. The SBD is utilised in\nlaying out signals but note that the spacing between block signals could be longer or shorter than SBD\n(see Fig 4).\n\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 5 of 13",

For trains travelling at a constant speed, the headway\ndistance can readily be converted to a headway time, but this should use timetabled speeds. This\nensures that the worst case is taken into consideration.\nIn Fig 5 which reflects any lineside signalling system in which there is only one cautionary aspect prior\nto the red (e.g. UK mainline 3-aspect):\nP = twice the signal spacing, each of which is a minimum of SBD\nand therefore the best possible Headway = S + 2x SBD +O+L\nIn Fig 4 which reflects UK mainline 4-aspect signalling (but is essentially similar to some speed\nsignalling systems) where the braking from full line speed to a stop is achieved over two (or even more)\nsignal sections:\nP = three times the signal spacing, with alternate signals spaced at a minimum of SBD\nand therefore the best possible Headway = S$ + 1.5x SBD +O+L\nThus, the capacity of the railway has been increased, but at the cost and provision/maintenance of\nsignificantly more signalling infrastructure.\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 8 of 13",

      "text": "Institution of Railway Signal Engineers\n7.2 Capacity constraints\nIn reality however, most railways have lengths of track for which the permitted speed is less than the\nmaximum elsewhere. Even where the speed profile of the line is unchanging, there are often\nintermediate stations and consequentially those trains that stop will be slowing down and accelerating\nagain. If all trains stop and also have the same acceleration and braking characteristics, the signals can\nbe spaced appropriately for the resultant speed profile, taking advantage of the shorter braking distance\nand attainable speeds. This technique permits the distance between signals to be lower in the area of\nthe station and thus still deliver good headway time, despite the slower running and the platform “dwell\ntime”; it is usually only applied to metro railways.\nHowever, if the signalling needs to facilitate the running of any non-stopping trains, the signal spacing\nmust always reflect the full braking distance; this means that the stopping headway (time between\nsuccessive trains which stop at the station) would be significantly increased. Timetabling one stopping\ntrain between a pair of non-stopping trains utilises a disproportionate amount of line capacity. Similarly,\nif a line is used by trains of different speeds, it makes no sense to talk of the headway of the line; it is a\nmatter of working out the detail of how quickly the faster train will catch up the slower train and where\nthe track layout is such that it can pass (overtake) it. Computer simulations of possible timetables being\nimplemented upon the proposed signalling are often undertaken at the conceptual stage of signalling\nthe layout.\nHence, factors that affect Headway are:\n\ne running stopping trains between non-stopping trains,\n\ne differential train speeds, meaning signalling cannot be optimum for both types,\n\ne junctions which may be high or low speed but are generally slower than the straight-ahead\n\nspeed.\nTrade-offs need to be considered between capacity and speed. Service Braking Distance increases in\nproportion to the square to the speed and so tends to dominate for a higher speed line; if it is\nacceptable that the permissible speed is reduced then signals could be closer together and the capacity\nimproved. The optimum capacity in terms of trains per hour (minimum headways) is obtained where all\ntrains have the same characteristics in terms of acceleration, deceleration, maximum speed and\ntimetabled stopping patterns. The best way to improve capacity measured by “passengers per hour” is\noften to run longer trains.\nFor metro type railways, factors other than the Service Braking Distance largely determine capacity, for\nexample the lengths of the train, the overlap, the sighting distance, the station dwell time. For heavy\nhaul mineral railways, the Service Braking distance is important, but junction clearance at the end of a\nlong single line section often predominates.\n8. Operational use of Track Layout\n\nSo far, we have been considering a simple plain line railway, but we now need to look at the other\nprimary role of signals, protecting hazards such as points and level crossings. It is important to\nunderstand the operational use which is made of the track layout i.e. what train movements are\nrequired? is there a need to join two separate trains together or undertake shunting movements\npassenger and/or freight?\nJunction protection and Signalling arrangements will be considered in sections 12 & 13, to which the\nconsiderations of section 9 are particularly relevant, but most of it applies to all signals so will be\nconsidered next.\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 9 of 13",

Signal Positions\nApart from the considerations of headway and braking distances, there are also other constraints on the\nposition of signals which need to be understood to correctly signal the layout. Design for a particular\nrailway needs to follow standards of the relevant railway administrations because they vary. The\nfollowing paragraphs summarise the most common.\nPhysical sighting: The purpose of the signal is to communicate information to the train driver. To\nenable this, the driver needs to be able to see it clearly for a sufficient period of time to assimilate the\ninformation. A site survey can be used to determine the final signal position to confirm readability,\nalthough increasing use is being made of virtual signal sighting (a computer model based on existing\nsite data and reflecting the proposed alterations being undertaken). Where a signal needs to be\npositioned somewhere which does not provide adequate sighting distance, the sighting deficiency must\nbe mitigated (various railways has different mitigations; in UK Main line this generally involves provision\nof a banner repeating signal).\nParallel signals: Not only does a driver have to be able to see a signal, but they also have to\ndetermine which signal applies to them if they can see more than one signal at the same time. For this\nreason, many railway administrations require that, when there are parallel lines signalled for the same\ndirection of traffic, then the signals shall usually be adjacent to one another, unless specific measures\nare put in place to mitigate the risk of incorrect reading. Examples may be mounting one at much\nreduced height or providing a short-range head or a physical screen to obstruct the view from other\ndirections. This is particularly applicable for platform departure signals.\nMaintenance & Installation constraints: Signals need to be installed in a practical position - often a\nconstraint on urban railways with viaducts and tunnels. They also need maintenance, although this is\nless of a consideration for a LED signal than a traditional filament lamp signal. The aim should still be to\navoid putting them where access would be a problem, such as on viaducts or in tunnels, but sometimes\nthis is inevitable because of the need to respect other constraints. Where other considerations permit, it\nis advantageous to place the signal near an access point for convenience throughout its operational\nlife.\nOverlap clear of junction: If the overlap of a signal extends through a junction, then the route up to\nthat signal will lock the junction, until the train has come to a proven stand at the signal protecting the\njunction. This clearly precludes other simultaneous conflicting movements through the junction. It is\nmore flexible and greatly reduces the complexity of the interlocking if the overlap limit is before the\njunction, especially on converging junctions (see Fig 13).\nReasonably Even spacing: It helps a driver to know where to expect a signal if they are relatively\nevenly spaced. In particular, where an aspect sequence extends over two signal sections, it is easier\nfor the driver to judge their brake application if the intermediate signal is placed approximately mid-way\nbetween the first caution and the stop.\nOverbraking: The minimum distance between the first cautionary aspect and the stop signal at the end\nof the movement authority is the service braking distance. However, if the actual distance is very\nsignificantly greater than this, then there is a risk that the driver becomes accustomed to not applying\nthe brakes at the caution and may then forget or misjudge their brake application, resulting in the risk of\noverrunning their movement authority. For this reason, excessive over braking should be avoided if\npossible; In UK mainline, there is a 50% overbraking rule to limit this. Other railway operators prefer to\nplace distant signals at a consistent distance from every station, regardless of speed of line.\nPlatform Starter signals: Where signals are required in the vicinity of a station platform, then they\nshould usually be positioned at or near the exit end of the platform (to minimise platform reoccupation\ntime). Alternatively, the signal should be at least a train’s length beyond the platform (so that no part of a\ntrain stopping at it will still be in the platform).\nStandage: In certain parts of the layout, it is necessary to be able to fit a train of the specified maximum\nlength (perhaps in a loop line to allow the locomotive to run around to be at the other end of its train).\nThe position of signals relative to each other, or relative to the point work or level crossing on its\napproach needs to be sufficient to avoid the rear of the train unnecessarily locking the infrastructure and\nhence preventing other movements. This needs to be considered with an appropriate allowance for\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 10 of 13",

Train Detection\nFor the purpose of layout design, the important factor is defining the limits of each section. The number\nof train detection sections provides the “resolution” of the signalling system's view of train positioning.\nFor the greatest “resolution” there needs to be more train detection sections, but clearly each section\nprovided comes with an economic cost. However, where there are ETCS trains reporting their positions,\nthis information can be used to create virtual sections (i.e. without needing equipment trackside) within\nthe interlocking.\nSee section 12 regarding the positioning of train detection around point work.\n11. Signalling plan — implications of Junction locking\nIn order to successfully signal a layout, it is necessary to understand the principles of operation of the\nspecific railway. In the diagram below, signals 1, 3 and 5 are all placed sufficiently far from the point\nwork that the overlaps beyond them are free of junction conflict; therefore all the points remain free until\na route is set from any of those signals.\nSetting a route from signal 3 to signal 5 AG) rjowine wigan wae sa won\ninitiates the movement of 102 points and ow Se\n101 points to normal and also reserves the ‘*\nsections of track from signal 3 to the end ; S ,\nof the overlap beyond signal 5.

Once the train has moved wholly onto train detection section AD, 102 points\nbecome free, with 101 remaining locked. This would prevent the route from signal 4 to 6 signal being\nset until the train had cleared the whole of AD section even if actually physically clear of points 101; the\nconsequential delay would be lengthy if signal 5 were not showing a proceed aspect.\nUnnecessary delay could be eliminated by SQ\"\nproviding additional train detection WN? dverning pavets\nsections to release the locking on points cc or\nmore quickly as shown in this diagram, 3 5\nbut these add to the cost. re AA 5 AC AD ne\nThis is an example where Signalling the BA . an ac 80\nLayout needs to balance various different OH BB O4\nconsiderations when determining what ? 4\nfacilities are economically justified for the\nintended use of the railway.\nFigure 13: Optimising train detection limits at junctions\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 11 of 13",

Signalling plan — implications of Junction Signalling arrangements\nWhere lines diverge, the track layout is often designed (for economic or geographic reasons) such that\none route (the main line) has a much higher permitted speed that the other route (the diverging line).\nWhen a train is routed onto the diverging line, the driver needs to know sufficiently early so that they\ncan adjust the train s speed appropriately.\n\ne Ona “Speed” signalled system, the driver can be notified by the aspect displayed at the\nprevious signal(s) the speed at which they may pass the junction signal.\n\ne On “Route” signalled systems, the driver is generally informed of the route set by means of an\nIndicator at the junction signal and is expected to adjust their speed based on their knowledge\nof the route. The problem is that, unless some form of warning has been given to the driver\npreviously, there could be insufficient distance to brake to the permitted speed.\n\nOn some railway administrations therefore, earlier speed reduction is partially enforced by “Approach\nRelease”. This means holding the junction signal at red (or perhaps yellow) until the train is close to it\n(and should therefore have slowed) and the driver will be able to see any signal indication of divergent\nroute before the signal clears for it. This methodology can on its own be unnecessarily restrictive and so\nadditional signal indications are sometimes provided at or near the previous signal(s).\n\n13. Level (Grade) Crossings\nA level (grade) crossing is where a road crosses the railway line at the same level. Clearly there is a\nneed to ensure that the road is closed to road traffic before a train is able to pass across the level\ncrossing. The signalling plan needs to take these factors into account.\nRailway administrations adopt a wide variety of methodologies for providing this protection with varying\narrangements of lights, barriers, operating sequences etc., dependent upon local practice and highway\nregulations.\nHowever, they can be broadly split into 2 groups:\n\ne Crossings which are protected by signals. The signal is only allowed to clear when the crossing\nhas been proved to be closed to road traffic and the crossing area itself is clear. Signalling\ndesign needs to ensure that protecting signals are positioned appropriately (not too close or too\nfar away from the crossing) and that the level crossing sequence is commenced sufficiently\nearly so that a train does not receive a restrictive aspect sequence from the signals on the\napproach to the level crossing protecting signal.\n\ne Crossings which are not protected by signals continuously detect that no train is approaching in\norder to maintain the road open. Signalling the layout must provide a means to give the\nrequired minimum warning time before a train arrives at the crossing (e.g. positioning strike-in\npoints at sufficient distance), because it is essential that the road user is given enough time to\navoid being on the crossing. Generally, such crossings are not interlocked with signals but there\nare special cases where there is a signal within strike in distance or if there is a station at which\ntrains may stop.\n\nSignalling the Layout — IRSE Certificate essential reading (for October 2025) Page 12 of 13",
