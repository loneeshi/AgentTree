In the\npast a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in\ndifferent countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not\ninteroperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one\ncountry, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development\nwhich have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.\n\n1.3.1.2 Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are rethinking\ntheir infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which ATC systems\nplay an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce standardised systems\nto reduce system costs. In order to establish international standardisation of ATC\nsystems, the following document specifies the European Rail Traffic Management\n\nSystem/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).\n\n1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System\n1.4.1.1 The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:\n\ne Cross border interoperability.\n\ne Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.\n\ne Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.\n\ne Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling\nexploitation of maximum track capacity.\n\ne The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.\n\ne Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS\ncomponents. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the\nworld market.\n\ne Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic\nmanagement.\n\n1.5 About this Document\n\n1.5.1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System\n(ETCS) from a technical point of view.\n\n1.5.1.2 Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train\ncontrol systems to ETCS (e.g. STM's) over a transition period. They might be removed\nin a future edition of the standard.\n\n1.5.1.3 To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated\nand understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively\ntrackside equipment reacts in a uniform way to information received. Technical\ninteroperability requires specifications of a detailed level.\n\nSUBSET-026-1 System Requirements Specification Page 6/9\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 1\n\n05/07/2023 Introduction",

Reaching operational interoperability is outside the\nscope of the SRS.\n\n1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS\n\n1.6.1.1 The SRS covers 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this\nintroduction.\n\n1.6.1.2 All readers may need to refer to the Glossary of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET-023).\n\n1.7 Requirements\n\n1.7.1.1 This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the technical interoperability.\nThis is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally identified as\ncontaining ERTMS/ETCS on-board and/or ERTMS/ETCS trackside requirements (see\ndetails in chapter 9).\n\n1.7.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated requirements,\nwith the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control-Command and\nSignalling TSI and in this SRS.\n\n1.7.1.3 For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined according\nto the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs. In any case,\nthe requirements of this SRS, which are allocated to the trackside and related to the\nimplemented functions, shall be respected.\n\n1.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted.\n\n1.7.1.5 Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not\ngenerate any interoperability problems.\n\n1.8 Contents of the SRS\n\n1.8.1.1 The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System\n(ETCS) of ERTMS.\n\n1.8.1.2 This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter\nwithin the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find the\nrelevant chapters.\n\n1.8.2 Chapter 1: Introduction\n\n1.8.2.1 Chapter 1 (this chapter) gives a general introduction to the intention and structure of the\nSRS, including a brief overview of the contents of each chapter.\n\n1.8.3 Chapter 2: Basic System Description\n\n1.8.3.1 Chapter 2 gives an overview of the ERTMS/ETCS system structure.\n\n1.8.3.2 Chapter 2 also contains a description of the basic application levels.\n\nSUBSET-026-1 System Requirements Specification Page 7/9\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 1\n\n05/07/2023 Introduction",

These principles apply to\nonboard and trackside subsystems.\n\n1.8.4.2 The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.\n\n1.8.5 Chapter 4: Modes and Transitions\n\n1.8.5.1.1 Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all transitions\nbetween modes.\n\n1.8.6 Chapter 5: Procedures\n\n1.8.6.1 Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for\ninteroperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a\ncorresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are\ndefined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS\nonboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to another.\n\n1.8.7 Chapter 6: Management of older System Versions\n\n1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and lists the\nexceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other chapters\nof the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used by the trackside\nsubsystem.\n\n1.8.8 Chapter 7: ERTMS/ETCS Language\n\n1.8.8.1 Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow\nover the air gap between track and train. The grouping of these into packets is described.\nThe format of messages is given in Chapter 8.\n\n1.8.9 Chapter 8: Messages\n\n1.8.9.1 Chapter 8 defines the application protocol (format and content of messages, logical\nsequence for radio) necessary to achieve technical interoperability.\n\n1.8.9.2 The scope of this chapter is limited to the application protocol and the content of\nmessages.\n\n1.8.10 Chapter 9: Classification of the SRS clauses\n\n1.8.10.1 | Chapter 9 encloses a classification into categories of all the clauses in the chapters 1 to\n8 of the SRS.\n\n1.8.10.2 In particular to assess properly the compliance of an ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment\nwith the SRS, it identifies which clauses contain requirements allocated to the\nERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and conversely which ones do not, either because\n\n“SUBSET-026-1 = ~~...

These\nprinciples apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.\n\n3.3.1.2 The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general\nand functional terms.\n\n3.3.1.3 The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several\nrequirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification\nnumber.\n\n3.3.1.4 Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as\nrequirements.\n\n3.4 Balise configuration, linking and Euroloop\n\n3.4.1 Balise Configurations — Balise Group Definition\n\n3.4.1.1 A balise group consists of between one and eight balises sharing the same balise group\nidentity.\n\n3.4.1.2 In every balise, the following information is at least stored:\na) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise\nb) The number of balises inside the group\nc) The balise group identity.\n\n3.4.1.3 The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the group.\n\n3.4.2 Balise Co-ordinate System\n\n3.4.2.1.1 Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system.\n\n3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group is defined by the nominal\ndirection (see 3.4.2.2.2) and is identified as balise group orientation.\n\n3.4.2.2 Balise groups composed of two or more balises\n\n3.4.2.2.1 |The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise number\n1 (called location reference) in the balise group.\n\n3.4.2.2.1.1 Exception: If the balise number 1 of the group is duplicated, the balise number 2 shall be\nthe location reference in case, out of this pair of duplicated balises, the ERTMS/ETCS\non-board equipment has only received the telegram from the balise number 2.\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 10/252\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 3\n\n05/07/2023 Principles",

As a second example, a single TSR encompasses two location\nitems, i.e. a \"max\" location item at its start location and a \"min\" location item at its end\nlocation.

Otherwise, these location items (e.g. “min”,\n“estimated” and “max” MA section ends) will be referred to the SOLR with different\ndistances, after a relocation as per clause 3.6.4.2.5 b) or c) has taken place.\nSUBSET-0263 ~—......__.

Release\nspeed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.3.6.5).\n\nf) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.\n\ne A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for\nthe revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is\ncalled the Section time-out.\ne In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the MA.\nThis second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it is\noccupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.\n\n3.8.1.2 The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time\n\nelapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.\n\n3.8.1.3 Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):\n\ne the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to fixed\nblock principles)\n\ne the position of the last confirmed rear end of a train i.e. the position deduced from the\nconfirmed train length information contained in a position report confirming the train\nintegrity (if the line is operated according to moving block principles)\n\ne the fouling point of a switch, positioned for a route, conflicting with the current\ndirection of movement of the train (both for fixed and moving block mode of operation)\n\n3.8.1.4 Note: Traditionally the overlap is a piece of track (beyond the danger point), that is put\nat disposal of a train, to guarantee a non hazardous situation, also in case the driver\nshould misjudge the stopping distance for the train. In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can be\nused to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.\n\n3.8.1.5 Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations\ndepending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the\nsituation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:\n\na) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests a\nroute release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.\n\nb) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the\nautomatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a\nstandstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.\n\nCc) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the overlap\nassociated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that the train\nhas successfully stopped before its End of Movement Authority. If the overlap is still\nunoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the overlap.\n\n3.8.1.6 Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance\nto the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero, a target speed higher\nthan zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority).

Assume for instance a (theoretical) train without any rotating mass,\nnot braking, on a downhill gradient from height 1 to height 2. All the energy added to the\ntrain when it goes from H1 to H2 is converted into linear forward motion. This can be\nobserved as an acceleration due to the gradient. Now assume the same train with part\nof the weight rotating. If this train travels the same distance from H1 to H2, the same\namount of energy is added to the train. But now a part of that energy is converted into\nrotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear forward motion. The\nlatter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for the train without rotating\nmass.\n\n3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it is\nalready taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.\n\n3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used:\na) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:\ne Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)\ne Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)\nb) If M_rotating_nom is known:\ne Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)\ne Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_ nom)\nLegend:\nA_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient (downhill acceleration is given\nwith a negative value)\ng = 9.81 m/s? - acceleration of gravity in m/s?\ngrad = gradient values in %o (positive = uphill)\nM_rotating_nom = nominal rotating mass (part of train data) as a percentage of the\ntotal train weight\nM_rotating_max = maximum possible rotating mass (see A.3.1) as a percentage of the\ntotal train weight\nM_rotating_min = minimum possible rotating mass (see A.3.1) as a percentage of the\ntotal train weight\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 132/252\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 3\n\n05/07/2023 Principles",

The\nother reason is that in a level 1 application the train has to be able to overpass the balise\nwhen the signal clears.

Thereby, the behaviour of\nthe RBCs is independent from such on-board degraded situation.\n\n3.15.1.1.3 However, such an RBC/RBC handover performed by a train with only one\ncommunication session established through GSM-R at once may result in performance\npenalties since it will not be able to “prepare” (session establishment, version\ndetermination, ...) the expected supervision by the Accepting RBC until the on-board\ndisconnects from the Handing Over RBC.\n\n3.15.1.1.4 Intentionally deleted.\n\n3.15.1.1.5 For successive RBC/RBC handovers, it shall be possible for an RBC to act as the\nAccepting and as the Handing Over RBC for the same engine at different RBC/RBC\nborder locations simultaneously.\n\n3.15.1.1.5.1 Note: Successive RBC/RBC handover means that the trackside initiates another\nhandover procedure while an ongoing handover has not finished. However, from the\nERTMS/ETCS on-board point of view, there is only one handover at a time.\n\n3.15.1.1.5.2 Note: An RBC acting as both Accepting and Handing Over RBC for the same engine\nmay as Accepting RBC forward all or parts of route related information it receives as\nHanding Over RBC, but if and how this is done is intentionally not specified.\n\n3.15.1.1.6 In an RBC/RBC handover, the Accepting RBC is defined by the RBC transition order,\nwhile the Handing Over RBC is the RBC which the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment\nconsiders as the supervising RBC when receiving an RBC transition order.\n\n3.15.1.1.6.1 Exception: clause 3.15.1.3.2 describes a situation when the current Accepting RBC\nbecomes the new Handing Over RBC.\n\n3.15.1.2 Handing Over RBC\n\n3.15.1.2.1 When the Handing Over RBC detects that a route is set for a train to enter another RBC\narea, it shall send:\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 182/252\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 3\n\n05/07/2023 Principles",

Reason: it has been specified in that way for obvious\nergonomic reasons (see 3.13.10.6.1).\n\nA.3.5.2 A maximum time Tn (see Subset-036 clause 4.2.9) after it has received a balise group\nmessage (i.e. a maximum time Tn after it has received the last balise telegram of the\nbalise group), the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall not consider any action\nrelated to passing an EOA (only in level 1), an LOA, or a former EOA/LOA located in\nadvance of the train position measured at the time of reception of this last telegram, until\nthe content of the message has been taken into account.\n\nA.3.5.2.1. Example 1: in level 1, the crossing of the EOA/LOA location with the min safe antenna,\nbefore a new extended MA (received when the min safe antenna was in rear of the\nEOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other terms the replacement\nof the EOA/LOA is considered by the on-board as happening before the min safe\nantenna crosses the EOA/LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.7 applies).\n\nA.3.5.2.2 Example 2: when the override function is active, the crossing of the former EOA/LOA\nlocation by the min safe antenna, before a “Stop if in SR” information (received when the\nmin safe antenna was in rear of the former EOA/LOA) has been processed, will not lead\nto the end of the override procedure followed by a train trip due to “Stop if in SR”. In other\nterms, both the deletion of the former EOA/LOA and the end of override procedure (see\n5.8.3.1.3 and 5.8.4.1 c)) are considered by the on-board as simultaneously happening\nbefore the min safe antenna crosses the former EOA/LOA location.\n\nA.3.5.2.3 Example 3: in level 2, the crossing of the LOA location with the min safe front end before\nan immediate level transition order to level NTC or level 0 (received when the min safe\nfront end was in rear of the LOA) has been processed, will not lead to train trip. In other\nterms the deletion of the MA (and therefore the deletion of the LOA) due to the level\nchange is considered by the on-board as happening before the min safe front end\ncrosses the LOA location (i.e. preventing that clause 3.13.10.2.6 a) applies).\n\n“SUBSET-026-3 = SystemRequirements Specification == = + Page 229/252\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 3\n\n05/07/2023 Principles",

The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the level,\n\nthe origin and the type of information’, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted\n\ninformation depending on the mode and the type of information’.\n\n4.8.1.3 If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that message\nshall be evaluated considering the level transition information.\n\n4.8.1.3.1 Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a\nconditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated against\nthe first filter in two steps:\n\n1) A first evaluation shall take place considering the on-board currently operated level,\nas if a level transition order for further location had been received (i.e. the condition\n[1] or [2] of Figure 3, if applied, shall be automatically fulfilled).\n\n2) Then, if relevant, information to which the condition [1] or [2] of Figure 3 applies shall\nbe immediately extracted from the buffer and re-evaluated according to the new\nselected level. The information accepted or rejected immediately considering the on-\nboard currently operated level shall not be re-evaluated according to the new selected\nlevel.\n\n4.8.1.4 Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a change\nof level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This implies that,\nwhen the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment - still unchanged, until the\nstored information has been processed. The consequence for the Third Filter is that\ninformation needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes in which this\ninformation is otherwise useless.\n\n4.8.1.5 If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all other\nnon-infill information in that message.\n\n4.8.1.6 When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of\ninformation released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be\nevaluated prior to any other location related information.\n\nSUBSET-026-4 System Requirements Specification Page 60/93\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitions\n\n05/07/2023",

Therefore this information need not to be referred\nto in the following tables.\n\n4.8.2.3 In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region\nidentity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any\n\nfurther check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)).\n\nOtherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group message,\n\nshall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need not to be\n\nreferred to in the following tables.\n4.8.2.4 Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the\n\nSTM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), what will happen to the data to be used\n\nby applications outside ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an\n\nexternal application, processed by a national function...) is outside the scope of this\nspecification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board\nfunctionality.\n\n4.8.2.5 Note: the system version order received from balise group need not be referred to in the\nfollowing tables because it is taken into account by the on-board equipment prior to the\nchecks referred to in this section (see also clause 3.17.3.3).\n\nSUBSET-026-4 System Requirements Specification Page 62/93\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitions\n\n05/07/2023",

The procedures focus on the required\nchange in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.\n\n5.3.2.2 Entities\nThe procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the entities\nthat are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board equipment, the\ntrackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.\n\n5.3.2.3 States\nStates are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions and\na specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains active as\nlong as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not completely\nsatisfied.\nNote 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.\nNote 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another\none. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force\nbranching in states.\n\n5.3.2.4 Transitions\nTransitions define the rules for passing from one state to another. A transition is triggered\nby a set of conditions which has to be fulfilled in a defined order or at the same time.\n\nSUBSET-026-5 System Requirements Specification Page 10/112\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 5\n\n05/07/2023 Procedures",

The\nERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment is not involved in this procedure, since it does not\nsupervise the train movements.\n5.8.1.4 In ERTMS equipped areas (level 1 or 2), locations where the train shall stop are\nsupervised by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. Receiving an order from the\nsignalman to pass the End of Movement Authority, the driver must then be able to inhibit\nthis supervision.\n5.8.1.4.1 Note: The driver must not use the “Override” procedure unless authorised by trackside\npersonnel. This authorisation is covered by operational procedures.\n5.8.1.5 If a signal at danger must be passed between announcement and execution of the level\ntransition from an unfitted area (level 0) or from an area fitted with a National System\n(level NTC) to an ERTMS equipped area (level 1 or 2 ), the signalman gives the order to\nthe driver to select “override”.\n5.8.1.6 Note: By using this procedure the driver is fully responsible for the train driving.

Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has\nnevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of the\nOn Sight area. This information\ne can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside\nscope of ERTMS/ETCS), or\ne can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a\n“track ahead free” request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment displays to\nthe driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current\nsection, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this information to the\nRBC.\n5.9.6.2.4 Note: Receiving the “track ahead free” information, the RBC may be able to transmit an\nMA from the current position of the train, e.g., for Full Supervision (refer to SRS chapter\n4, transitions between modes).\n5.9.6.3 Second case: The On Sight area ends before the EOA/LOA of the current MA\n5.9.6.3.1 In this case, the current Movement Authority already allows the train to exit the On Sight\narea.\n5.9.6.3.2 When exiting the On Sight area, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment switches either\nto Full Supervision, to Limited Supervision or to Shunting mode (refer to SRS chapter 4,\ntransitions between modes).\nSUBSET-026-5 System Requirements Specification Page 44/112\n4.0.0 Chapter 5\n05/07/2023 Procedures",

For example, because the train is awakening\non a metal covered area or because the driver had to select override and move the train\nover a metal covered area. This can result in deadlocks.\n\n5.22.1.6 To avoid that, the procedure detailed in this section provides a means for the driver to\ninhibit the potential safe reaction to a BTM alarm. This in turn enables a SoM or a generic\nmovement over a BMM in an ETCS equipped area (level 1 or 2) when no BMM track\ncondition is stored on-board.\n\n5.22.1.7_ Note: The driver should use the “Inhibition” procedure only when authorised to do so.\nThis authorisation should be covered by operational procedures because to inhibit a safe\nreaction may be detrimental to safety.\n\n5.22.1.8 In addition, a provision is introduced to allow the procedure to be automatically triggered\nwithout driver intervention. This provision applies in case the train is in an area covered\nby a BMM track condition stored on board, and the track condition gets reset (for example\nbecause of a transition to SR mode caused by Override activation).\n\n5.22.2 Manual triggering of the procedure\n\n5.22.2.1 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall allow the driver to select “Inhibition of\nreaction to BTM alarm” only at standstill when the level is 1 or 2 and the current mode is\nStand-By, Shunting, or Staff Responsible.\n\nSUBSET-026-5 System Requirements Specification Page 111/112\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 5\n\n05/07/2023 Procedures",

For\nexample, in the case of awakening over a BMM the train has moved past the limit of the\nmetallic covered area and so there is no more need to have the inhibition active.\nRevoking the inhibition in turn increases safety, because it allows the on-board to have\na safe reaction should there be a failure in the balise reader system that was until then\n“masked” by the inhibition set manually or automatically.\n\nSUBSET-026-5 System Requirements Specification Page 112/112\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 5\n\n05/07/2023 Procedures",

Some of these\nvalues have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised\nhandling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally, depending\non the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values included in this\ndocument for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior verification of\ntheir validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details.\n\n7.3.2 Definition of Variables\n\n7.3.2.1 Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor units.\nThe whole variable has one type (meaning).\n\n7.3.2.2 Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the variable.\n\n7.3.2.3 Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.g. 32767 = “unknown’).\n\n7.3.2.4 Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range\n\n7.3.2.5 Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as\ndescribed in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different\nnames.\n\n7.3.2.6 All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are used,\nif used in more than one media.\n\n7.3.2.7 Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement.\n\n7.3.2.8 One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true.\n\n7.3.2.9 Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where\njustified.\n\n7.3.2.10 When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall be\ntransmitted first.\n\n7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes:\n\nA_ Acceleration\nD_ distance\n\nSUBSET-026-7 System Requirements Specification Page 7/91\n\n4.0.0 Chapter 7\n\n05/07/2023 ERTMS/ETCS language",

However:\n\na) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on\nthe accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMS/ETCS on-board\nand/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”.\n\nb) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables,\nsee chapters 7 and 8) are also described with tables. The numbered titles (i.e. the\nname of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated\ntable are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS on-\nboard and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword “shall”\neither.\n\n9.3.2.3 Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined, in case\n\na requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and\n\nERTMS/ETCS trackside or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on-board and\n\ntrackside requirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability reasons.\n\nSUBSET-026-9 System Requirements Specification Page 5/148\n4.0.0 Chapter 9\n05/07/2023 Classification of clauses",
