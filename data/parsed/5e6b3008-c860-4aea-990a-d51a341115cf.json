In the\npast a number of different Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems have evolved in\ndifferent countries at different times. These systems are incompatible and not\ninteroperable with each other. Only a few of these systems are used in more than one\ncountry, and even in those cases there have been differences in detailed development\nwhich have resulted in incompatible and not interoperable versions.\n\n1.3.1.2 Many railways anticipate a significant increase in density of train traffic and are\nrethinking their infrastructure strategy, to accommodate high levels of traffic, in which\n\nATC systems play an important part. Also many railways would like to introduce\n\nstandardised systems to reduce system costs. In order to establish international\n\nstandardisation of ATC systems, the following document specifies the European Rail\n\nTraffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS).\n\n1.4 Advantages of an International Interoperable System\n1.4.1.1 The advantages expected by the railways can be summarised as:\n\ne Cross border interoperability.\n\ne Improvement of the safety of national and international train traffic.\n\ne Improvement of international passengers and freight train traffic management.\n\ne Shorter headway on heavily trafficked lines, by driving on moving block, enabling\nexploitation of maximum track capacity.\n\ne The possibility of step-by-step introduction of the new technology.\n\ne Enabling Pan-European competition between the manufacturers of ERTMS/ETCS\ncomponents. Strengthening the position of the European railway industry on the\nworld market.\n\ne Enabling preconditions for future harmonisation in other areas of rail traffic\nmanagement.\n\n1.5 About this Document\n\n1.5.1.1 The purpose of this document is to specify the unified European Train Control System\n(ETCS) from a technical point of view.\n\n1.5.1.2 Some parts of the system are only specified to allow a migration from existing train\ncontrol systems to ETCS (e.g. STM’s) over a transition period. They might be removed\nin a future edition of the standard.\n\n1.5.1.3 To reach technical interoperability it is necessary not only that telegrams are generated\nand understood according to well specified rules but also that a train respectively\n\nSUBSET-026-1 System Requirements Specification Page 5/8\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 1\n\n13/05/2016 Introduction",

Technical\ninteroperability requires specifications of a detailed level.\n\n1.5.1.4 For operational interoperability it is necessary to add operating rules, engineering\nstandards etc. to the system design. Reaching operational interoperability is outside\nthe scope of the SRS.\n\n1.6 How to Read and Use the SRS\n\n1.6.1.1 The SRS covers 9 chapters, which are briefly described in the section following this\nintroduction.\n\n1.6.1.2 All readers may need to refer to the Glossary of terms and abbreviations (SUBSET-\n023).\n\n1.7 Requirements\n\n1.7.1.1 This specification defines the functions that allow reaching the technical\ninteroperability. This is materialised through numbered clauses which are formally\nidentified as containing ERTMS/ETCS on-board and/or ERTMS/ETCS trackside\nrequirements (see details in chapter 9).\n\n1.7.1.2 The ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall implement all its allocated requirements,\nwith the only exceptions and conditions explicitly stated in the Control-Command and\nSignalling TSI and in this SRS.\n\n1.7.1.3 For ERTMS/ETCS trackside the implementation of functions has to be defined\naccording to the characteristics of the specific lines and the related operational needs.\nIn any case, the requirements of this SRS, which are allocated to the trackside and\nrelated to the implemented functions, shall be respected.\n\n1.7.1.4 Intentionally deleted.\n\n1.7.1.5 Not specified requirements and solutions shall only be permitted as long as they do not\ngenerate any interoperability problems.\n\n1.8 Contents of the SRS\n\n1.8.1.1 The SRS defines the system requirements for the European Train Control System\n(ETCS) of ERTMS.\n\n1.8.1.2 This sub-section is intended to give a rough overview of the contents of each chapter\nwithin the SRS so that readers interested only in specialised subjects can easily find\nthe relevant chapters.\n\nSUBSET-026-1 System Requirements Specification Page 6/8\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 1\n\n13/05/2016 Introduction",

These principles apply to\nonboard and trackside subsystems.\n\n1.8.4.2 The principles define the behaviour of the system in general and functional terms.\n\n1.8.5 Chapter 4: Modes and Transitions\n\n1.8.5.1.1. Chapter 4 defines the modes of the ERTMS/ETCS onboard equipment and all\ntransitions between modes.\n\n1.8.6 Chapter 5: Procedures\n\n1.8.6.1 Chapter 5 defines the dynamic behaviour of procedures that are necessary for\ninteroperability. Procedures are presented by a state transition chart and a\ncorresponding table, where all elements (States, events, transitions) of the chart are\ndefined. The description of the procedures shows all states of the ERTMS/ETCS\nOnboard unit and the conditions that must be fulfilled to switch from one state to\nanother.\n\n1.8.7 Chapter 6: Management of older System Versions\n\n1.8.7.1.1 Chapter 6 defines the envelope of legally operated system versions and lists the\nexceptions that shall apply by derogation to the requirements listed in the other\nchapters of the SRS, when an older ERTMS/ETCS system version is used by the\ntrackside subsystem.\n\n1.8.8 Chapter 7: ERTMS/ETCS Language\n\n1.8.8.1 Chapter 7 defines and describes the necessary variables to be used for the data flow\nover the air gap between track and train.

These\nprinciples apply to on-board and trackside subsystems.\n\n3.3.1.2 The principles define the operational and technical behaviour of the system in general\nand functional terms.\n\n3.3.1.3 The chapter is divided into subchapters. In each subchapter normally several\nrequirements are defined. Each requirement is identified with a unique identification\nnumber.\n\n3.3.1.4 Notes, Justifications and Examples are only informative and shall not be regarded as\nrequirements.\n\n3.4 Balise configuration and linking\n\n3.4.1 Balise Configurations — Balise Group Definition\n\n3.4.1.1 A balise group shall consist of between one and eight balises.\n\n3.4.1.2 In every balise shall at least be stored:\na) The internal number (from 1 to 8) of the balise\nb) The number of balises inside the group\nc) The balise group identity.\n\n3.4.1.3 The internal number of the balise describes the relative position of the balise in the\ngroup.\n\n3.4.2 Balise Co-ordinate System\n\n3.4.2.1.1 Every balise group has its own co-ordinate system.\n\n3.4.2.1.2 The orientation of the co-ordinate system of a balise group (i.e., nominal or reverse\ndirection) is identified as balise group orientation.\n\n3.4.2.2 Balise groups composed of two or more balises\n\n3.4.2.2.1. The origin of the co-ordinate system for each balise group is given by the balise\nnumber 1 (called location reference) in the balise group.\n\n3.4.2.2.2 The nominal direction of each balise group is defined by increasing internal balise\nnumbers.\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 9/204\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 3\n\n13/05/2016 Principles",

This non zero target speed can be time\nlimited.\n\nc) If no overlap exists, the Danger Point is a location beyond the End of Movement\nAuthority that can be reached by the front end of the train without a risk for a\nhazardous situation.\n\nd) The end of an overlap (if used in the existing interlocking system) is a location\nbeyond the Danger Point that can be reached by the front end of the train without a\nrisk for a hazardous situation. This additional distance is only valid for a defined\ntime.\n\ne) A release speed is a speed limit under which the train is allowed to run in the vicinity\nof the End of Movement Authority, when the target speed is zero. One release\nspeed can be associated with the Danger Point, and another one with the overlap.\nRelease speed can also be calculated on-board the train (see section 3.13.9.4).\n\nf) The MA can be split into several sections, The last one is called End Section.\n\ne A first time-out value can be attached to each section. This value will be used for\nthe revocation of the associated route when the train has not entered into it yet. It is\ncalled the Section time-out.\ne In addition, a second time-out value can be attached to the End Section of the\nMA. This second time-out will be used for the revocation of the last section when it\nis occupied by the train; it is called the End Section time-out.\n\n3.8.1.2 The values of the time-outs possibly given in an MA shall take into account the time\n\nelapsed from the start of validity of information to the sending of the message.\n\n3.8.1.3 Note: A Danger Point can be (not exhaustive list):\n\ne the entry point of an occupied block section (if the line is operated according to\nfixed block principles)\n\ne the position of the safe rear end of a train (if the line is operated according to\nmoving block principles)\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 48/204\n3.6.0 Chapter 3\n13/05/2016 Principles",

In ERTMS/ETCS the overlap can\nbe used to improve the efficiency of the braking supervision.\n\n3.8.1.5 Note: Time-out values can be given in the MA to cope with the following situations\ndepending on the interlocking operations, i.e. the timers on-board will only reflect the\nsituation trackside and when expired (on-board) the actions taken are restrictive:\n\na) Section time-out or time-out for the speed at the LOA: When a signalman requests\na route release of a part of a route not yet entered by the approaching train.\n\nb) End Section time-out: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the\nautomatic route release can be delayed to make sure that the train has come to a\nstandstill before any switches inside the route can be moved.\n\nc) Time-out for an overlap: When the train has entered the last part of a route, the\noverlap associated with the route remains valid for a certain time to make sure that\nthe train has successfully stopped before its End of Movement Authority. If the\noverlap is still unoccupied when the timer expires the interlocking revokes the\noverlap.\n\n3.8.1.6 Note: If the trackside equipment does not have enough information to give the distance\nto the End of Movement Authority with a target speed equal to zero, a target speed\nhigher than zero can be given (LOA, Limit of Authority). It is the responsibility of the\ntrackside to ensure that the safe distance beyond the LOA is long enough to brake the\ntrain from the target speed to a stand still without any hazardous situation. It is the\nresponsibility of the on-board equipment to apply the brakes if no new information is\nreceived when the Limit of Authority is passed.\n\n3.8.2 MA request to the RBC\n\n3.8.2.1 It shall be possible for the on-board equipment to request a new Movement Authority\nfrom the RBC.\n\n3.8.2.2 The parameters for requesting a new MA shall be given by the RBC.\n\n3.8.2.3 In level 2/3, the following possibilities shall be available:\n\na) A defined time before the train reaches the perturbation location assuming it is\nrunning at the warning speed (see section 3.13.11 for details).\n\nb) A defined time before the Section timer (not the End Section timer, not the Overlap\ntimer) for any section of the MA expires, or before the LOA speed timer expires.\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 49/204\n3.6.0 Chapter 3\n13/05/2016 Principles",

In this case, it is not convenient to pre-\nprogram the brake parameters necessary to calculate the braking curves. The only\npractical way to obtain the correct values for the current train composition is to include\nthem into the data entry process by the driver. However, it cannot be expected from\nthe driver to know deceleration values and brake build up times. Conversion models\nare therefore defined to convert the parameters entered by the driver (brake\npercentage and brake position) into the parameters of the corresponding brake model.\n3.13.3.1.2 Note: The process for defining the input parameters for the conversion model (brake\npercentage and brake position) is outside the scope of the ERTMS/ETCS\nspecifications.\n3.13.3.2 Applicability of the conversion models\n3.13.3.2.1 The conversion models shall be used by the on-board equipment if the brake\npercentage is acquired as part of Train Data, and if the maximum train speed, the\nbrake percentage and the train length are all within the following validity limits of the\nconversion models:\na) O< V § 200, where V is the maximum train speed in km/h\nb) 30 < A S$ 250, where A is the brake percentage in %\nc) 0 < Ls Lmax, where L is the train length in m and where Lmax = 900 m if the brake\nposition is “Passenger train in P” or Lmax = 1500 m if the brake position is “Freight\ntrain in P or “Freight train in G”\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 101/204\n3.6.0 Chapter 3\n13/05/2016 Principles",

But now a part of that energy is\nconverted into rotational motion and only the remaining part is converted into linear\nforward motion. The latter can be observed as an acceleration which is less than for\nthe train without rotating mass.\n\n3.13.4.3.1.2 Note: For the influence of the rotating mass on the deceleration due to the brake, it\nis already taken into account in the values for the brake parameters.\n\n3.13.4.3.2 The following formulas shall be used:\na) If M_rotating_nom is unknown:\ne Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_max)\ne Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_min)\nb) If M_rotating_nom is known:\ne Uphill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)\ne Downhill: A_gradient = g * grad / (1000+10*M_rotating_nom)\nLegend:\nA_gradient = acceleration/deceleration due to gradient\n\nSUBSET-026-3 System Requirements Specification Page 104/204\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 3\n\n13/05/2016 Principles",

The first filter is detailed in section 4.8.3 “Accepted information depending on the\nlevel and transmission media’, the third filter in section 4.8.4 “Accepted information\ndepending on the modes’.\n\n4.8.1.3 If a message contains level transition information, any other information in that\nmessage shall be evaluated considering the level transition information.\n\n4.8.1.3.1 Information received in the same message as an immediate level transition order or a\nconditional level transition order that causes a level transition shall be evaluated first\nconsidering the on-board currently operated level, as if a level transition order for\nfurther location had been received (i.e. conditions [1], [2] or [6] of Figure 3, if applied,\nshall be automatically fulfilled). Then, if relevant, it shall be immediately extracted from\nthe buffer and re-evaluated according to the new selected level.\n\n4.8.1.4 Note: As shown in Figure 3, information stored following an announcement of a\nchange of level, is re-checked for acceptance when the level has changed. This\nimplies that, when the level changes, the mode is - for a short moment - still\nunchanged, until the stored information has been processed. The consequence for the\nThird Filter is that information needs to be accepted for this short period also in modes\nin which this information is otherwise useless.\n\n4.8.1.5 If a message contains infill information, this latter shall be evaluated considering all\nother non-infill information in that message.\n\n4.8.1.6 When evaluating trackside information received by radio or when re-evaluating a set of\ninformation released from the transition buffer, linking information, if any, shall be\nevaluated prior to any other location related information.\n\nSUBSET-026-4 System Requirements Specification Page 55/75\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitions\n\n13/05/2016",

If this\ninformation is received from the “Accepting” RBC while the “Handing Over” RBC is\nstill responsible, it is stored onboard until the RBC transition is performed\nException 1: The information “Acknowledgement of Train Data’, “Trackside\nconstituent system version’, \"Session Management\" and “Acknowledgement of\nSession Termination\" shall be immediately accepted.\nException 2: The information “Co-operative shortening of MA”, “Revocation of\nEmergency Stop” and “LSSMA display toggle on/off order” shall be rejected.\n\nd) to check exception [4] in 4.8.3, the track description is referred to the LRBG (i.e.\nrelocation has been performed see 3.6.4.3).\n\ne) the information from balise is received while no reverse movement is performed\n(see clause 3.14.3.6)\n\n4.8.2.2 Regarding 4.8.2.1 a): In case a balise is missed or a balise telegram cannot be\ndecoded, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction” is\nonly used by the on-board equipment to inhibit the service brake reaction, while the\nbalise group message is rejected. If all the telegrams from a balise group are correctly\nread, the information “Inhibition of balise group message consistency reaction”, if\nreceived, shall be ignored by the on-board equipment. Therefore this information need\nnot to be referred to in the following tables.\n\n4.8.2.3 In case a balise telegram contains the information VBC marker and a country/region\nidentity that both match a stored VBC, the whole balise telegram is ignored and any\n\nfurther check in relation to this balise telegram is irrelevant (refer to 3.15.9.3 b)).\n\nOtherwise the information VBC marker, if included in a consistent balise group\n\nmessage, shall always be ignored by the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and need\n\nnot to be referred to in the following tables.\n4.8.2.4 Note: with the exception of the data that is forwarded to a National System through the\n\nSTM interface (see 3.15.6 and SUBSET-035), what will happen to the data to be used\n\nby applications outside ERTMS/ETCS (e.g. whether it is discarded, forwarded to an\n\nexternal application, processed by a national function...) is outside the scope of this\nspecification and is assumed as not being part of the ERTMS/ETCS on-board\nfunctionality.\n\nSUBSET-026-4 System Requirements Specification Page 57/75\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 4 : Modes and Transitions\n\n13/05/2016",

The procedures focus on the\nrequired change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.\n\n5.3.2.2 Entities\nThe procedures define the required system behaviour on a context level, i. e. the\nentities that are used to define the procedures are for example: the on-board\nequipment, the trackside equipment (RBC/Balise), the driver.\n\n5.3.2.3 States\nStates are situations of an ETCS subsystem with a specific set of available functions\nand a specific set of events that may start or terminate the state. A state remains\nactive as long as the conditions to trigger the transition to a succeeding state are not\ncompletely satisfied.\nNote 1: one mode of operation may include several states for the on-board equipment.\nNote 2: A new state is only created, if the behaviour of the system differs from another\none. Possession of information (e. g. location information) or not does not force\nbranching in states.\n\n5.3.2.4 Transitions\n\nSUBSET-026-5 System Requirements Specification Page 8/100\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 5\n\n13/05/2016 Procedures",

Some of these\nvalues have to be unique to ensure that the system functions properly. A centralised\nhandling of this assignment is therefore required (nationally or internationally,\ndepending on the variable). The variables concerned have been marked. The values\nincluded in this document for these variables are therefore not to be used without prior\nverification of their validity. See SUBSET-054 for further details.\n\n7.3.2 Definition of Variables\n\n7.3.2.1 Variables are used to encode single data values. Variables cannot be split in minor\nunits. The whole variable has one type (meaning).\n\n7.3.2.2 Variables may have special values which are related to the basic meaning of the\nvariable.\n\n7.3.2.3 Special values have always the highest values in a variable (e.g. 32767 = “unknown’).\n\n7.3.2.4 Spare values are located between the normal and special values in the variable range\n\n7.3.2.5 Names of variables are unique. A variable is used in context with the meaning as\ndescribed in the variable definition. Variables with different meanings have different\nnames.\n\n7.3.2.6 All variable definitions are independent of the transport media over which they are\nused, if used in more than one media.\n\n7.3.2.7 Signed values shall be encoded as 2’s complement.\n\n7.3.2.8 One bit variables (Boolean) always use 0 for false and 1 for true.\n\n7.3.2.9 Offsets for numerical values are avoided (0 is used for 0, 1 for 1, etc.) except where\njustified.\n\n7.3.2.10 When transmitting over the different transmission media, the most significant bit shall\nbe transmitted first.\n\n7.3.2.11 All Variables have one of the following prefixes:\n\nSUBSET-0267 System Requirements Specification §#8 = Page7/87\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 7\n\n13/05/2016 ERTMS/ETCS language",

A\nEurobalise telegram contains one header and an identified and coherent set of\nPackets.\n\nSUBSET-026-8 System Requirements Specification Page 7/33\n\n3.6.0 Chapter 8\n\n13/05/2016 Messages",

However:\n\na) In section 9.4, tables are identified as a single entity through a reference based on\nthe accompanying clause number. They can be classified as ERTMS/ETCS on-\nboard and/or trackside requirements even if they do not include the keyword “shall”.\n\nb) Elements of the ERTMS/ETCS language (radio messages, packets and variables,\nsee chapters 7 and 8) are also described with tables. The numbered titles (i.e. the\nname of the element preceded by a clause number) together with their associated\ntable are considered as single entities and are classified as both ERTMS/ETCS on-\nboard and trackside requirements, even if they do not include the keyword “shall”\neither.\n\n9.3.2.3 Amongst the categories listed in 9.3.2.1 only the two first ones can be combined, in\ncase a requirement equally applies to both ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment and\n\nERTMS/ETCS trackside or in case two unambiguously distinguishable on-board and\n\ntrackside requirements are kept together in the concerned clause for readability\n\nreasons.\nSUBSET-026-9 System Requirements Specification Page 4/123\n3.6.0 Chapter 9\n43/05/2016 Classification of clauses",
