      "text": "Glossary of Train Control Terminology v1.2\nThis glossary includes many of the terms that you will encounter in the Certificate (Module A)\nof the IRSE Examination. Its focus is on commonly used acronyms and on terms where, in\ndifferent countries, there are alternative names in English for the same object, role, or\nfunction. It is not a comprehensive list of all train control terminology. It does not address\ntelecommunications terminology because this tends to be more consistent between\ncountries.\nYou are not expected to learn the descriptions in the 3° column. Just look down the first\ncolumn and check if there are any terms that you are not familiar with. The term in the first\ncolumn is the one that is usually used in the examination.\nAcronyms\nApproach control Approach release The restriction of the aspect of a\n(approach release) signal, to control the speed of a\ntrain (e.g. to ensure that the\ndriver can comply with the turnout\nspeed at a junction\nApproach locking Approach locking prevents the\nimmediate release of a route\nwhere it is possible that an\napproaching train may be unable\nto stop.\nSignal light signal as displayed to the driver.\nAutomatic Train Control ATC On-board automation that\ncontributes to or replaces the\ndriver’s judgement and actions in\nrespect of controlling the train. It\nencompasses ATO and ATP.\nAutomatic Train ATO A system that automatically\nOperation operates the train’s driving\ncontrols\nAutomatic Train ATP A safety system that enforces\nProtection either compliance with or\nobservation of speed restrictions\nand/or signal aspects by trains.\nAutomatic Train ATS A non-safety system (common on\nSupervision metros) which regulates a train\nservice, typically to maintain\nintended traffic patterns and to\nminimise the effects of train\ndelays on the operating schedule.\nAutomatic Route Setting ARS A system for setting routes\nwithout the action of the signaller\nsignal operator).\new\" |\npassage of trains.
