Those parts are shortly described below.\n2.1 TASK 13.1: SYSTEM DEFINITION\nThe objective of this Task (13.1) is to define the signalling system, called Moving Block System, in\nparticular the system objectives, capabilities, boundaries, functions, operational requirements and\nassumptions in order to cooperate with the Moving Block concept and constitutes the first part of the\nDeliverable 13.1.\n2.2 TASK 13.2: MOVING BLOCK SPECIFICATION — REQUIREMENTS, ENGINEERING,\nAND OPERATIONAL RULES\nBased on the System Definition the purpose of this task is to analyse the impact of the System Pillar\non System Requirements and to develop a Moving Block Specification. The work on the Moving\nBlock Specification is organized in an iterative and incremental fashion in five releases. The first\nthree releases are planned for WP13 and releases 4 and 5 are planned for WP14. The contents of\neach release are defined in collaboration with the stakeholders (e.g. prototype developers and the\ndemonstrators WP). Each release leads to an intermediate and reviewed version of the Moving Block\nSpecification.\n2.3 TASK 13.3: MOVING BLOCK SAFETY ANALYSIS\nThe subject of this task was the safety analysis for the “Moving Block System” (MBS) that has been\nspecified in Tasks 13.1 and 13.2. To move a step beyond what was previously done in S2R (e.g.,\nin-depth analysis of relevant operational scenarios) a novel method — called System Theoretic\nProcess Analysis (STPA) - was applied to the matter. This STPA focuses on “unsafe control actions”\nin control and feedback loops within complex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the\npotential to identify emergent risks stemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems,\nwhich are often overlooked.\nFP2-T13_0-D-GTD-028-05 Page 6 of 7 08/07/2025\nInterne",

Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary\ndocument available, care must be taken to keep the definitions synchronised.\n\nArea of Control The Area of Control! is the topologically limited extent and the\ninfrastructural Trackside Assets in this geographical extent. The term is\nused here for defining the technical and operational responsibility of one\nMBS.\n\nDomain Data The Domain Data refers to use case specific configuration data for the\nMBS to define the specific application. These can be broadly classified\nas Map Data, Segment Profiles, and Parameter Data. As a part of\nconfiguration process, the MBS needs Domain Data. Potential updates\nof Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl.\nsynchronous activation of the new data version.\n\nOperational Plan The Operational Plan is the result of the planning process performed by\nthe planning system (TMS). It describes either a planned Operational\nMovement, Operational Restriction or Operational Warning Measure\nthrough a temporal sequence of Operational Events to be implemented\nby underlying subsystems in the Area of Control.\n\nOperational State The Operational State consists of train-related information (e.g.,\npermissions, authorisations or train position) and track-related\ninformation (e.g., state of Trackside Assets).\n\nSystem Capability A System Capability is a service an actor requires from the system to fulfil\nits business goals. System capabilities are realised by exploiting one or\nmultiple functions, usually in a chain of functions. System capabilities in\nterms of this document are very similar to use cases and the theory\nbehind it.\n\nTrain-centric A train-centric approach from a trackside point of view focuses on the\ntrain as the true business object. A train object is derived by a train-centric\nsignalling system using the currently available sensor information from\nthe train and the trackside. This allows the safety logic of train-centric\nsignalling system to operate on the train objects instead on the auxiliary\ninformation ‘occupancy’ only as today in conventional block-centric\nsignalling systems.\n\nTrackside Asset Trackside Assets are elements on or near the track which are used to\nmonitor (using sensors) and/or control (using actuators) the movement\nof vehicles through the railway network. to provide a safe route through\nthe railway network. They can be switchable or non-switchable and are\ncontrolled by the actors Trackside Asset Control and Supervision.\n\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 6 of 28 06/06/2025\n\nInterne",

The MBS is defined as a single system, without enforcing the conventional separation of\nRadio Block Centre (RBC) and interlocking (IXL). The MBS is based on ETCS cab signalling without\nlineside signals. It uses a more generic and simplified safety logic by abandoning the traditional block\nconcept mainly relying on signals. By emphasising the safety logic, the dependency on country\nspecific operational processes is reduced.\nThe Moving Block System builds on the Functional Railway System Architecture defined by the\nSystem Pillar and the Moving Block specification defined in Shift2Rail [4] and RCA initiative [3].\nDepending on the requirements and needs, the MBS can operate within an environment where TTD\nequipment is installed but also within an environment where TTD equipment is not installed. The\nrationale for considering TTD is to support migration, recovery from degraded situations, and to\nfacilitate sensor fusion principles to foster different localisation inputs.\n2.1.1 System capabilities\nThe fundamental objectives of the MBS are to ensure safe train movement and prevent railway\naccidents. They can be split into the following system capabilities:\n\ne MBS manages communication sessions with Trackside Assets (TA) via specified interfaces\nwithin its Area of Control (AoC).\n\ne MBS manages communication sessions with trains via specified interfaces within its AoC and\nadjacent areas where trains are supposed to establish or terminate a communication session.\n\ne MBS controls all TAs within its AoC.\n\ne MBS manages the current trackside state and determines the state of the track from\ninformation given during runtime by trains and TAs within its AoC.\n\ne MBS manages all track path allocations for all trains and vehicles within its AoC. This contains\nan adequate and risk-based protection of requested pieces of track for an intentional train\nmovement.\n\ne MBS issues authorisations for train movements based on requested and accepted track path\nallocations.\n\ne MBS supervises trains and TAs to prevent railway accidents. This includes especially any\ncollision, derailment or over-speeding.\n\ne MBS stores an up-to-date, reliable and consistent current Operational State and provides\nthis Operational State to systems connected to MBS.\n\ne MBS manages Domain Data changes e.g., by introducing new parts of the track.\n\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 12 of 28 06/06/2025\nInterne",

As it authorises a movement to an arbitrary (operationally sensible) location which\nmight or might not be the rear end of the preceding train, it is in its core moving block agnostic, as\nthe on-board unit is. Thus, the MBS is capable of supporting fixed block, virtual fixed block and\nmoving block operation. It depends on the requesting Plan Execution (PE) system which operation\nis actually performed.\n2.2 LONG TERM OPERATING STRATEGY AND CONDITIONS\nMBS shall offer increased operational flexibility (e.g., by enabling train movements from anywhere\nto anywhere, not using pre-defined paths) allowing for both the minimisation of manual operation by\nthe dispatcher/operator and enabling faster recovery from degraded and emergency situations.\nThe long-term operating strategy of the MBS in combination with the interfacing systems revolves\naround a high grade of operational automation. In the case of deviations from normal operation, the\nhigher level of automation facilitates the choice of flexible, operational alternatives as well as the\nreduction of risks associated with human errors by providing improved technical assistance (e.g., for\nconstruction workers, maintenance staff, operators).\nAll in all, MBS should contribute to the increase in capacity by utilising shorter headways enabled by\nthe more efficient use of the infrastructure, the use of information of the running trains and the more\nprecise occupancy information through the combination of information sources (e.g., axle counters,\ntrack circuits, Train Position Reports).\n2.3 SYSTEM LIFE-TIME CONSIDERATIONS\nSystem life-time is understood as system life-cycle within this system definition. MBS is foreseen\nwith a modular functional approach. Regarding this approach several life-cycle considerations have\nto be considered:\nMBS life-cycle is independent from life-cycles of surrounding systems. Any changes in PE, Digital\nRegister (DR) or Trackside Asset Control and Supervision (TACS) do not affect MBS as long as\ninterfaces used are unchanged. Due to generic safety logic, MBS life-cycle is independent from life-\ncycle of Domain Data provided by DR. Changes in infrastructure and TAs only affects the Domain\nData of the MBS without change the software of the MBS. MBS requirements lifecycle is envisioned\nindependent from hardware components and their operating systems.\nThe only dependency is given by the MBS functional lifecycle itself.\n2.4 LOGISTIC CONSIDERATIONS\nThe MBS as described within this system definition is not a physical product. At this stage of\ndevelopment, logistic considerations are not necessary.\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 13 of 28 06/06/2025\nInterne",

This would drastically minimise the need for adjustments to MBS ona\nnational level.\nNevertheless, considering that the MBS will be integrated into existing railway infrastructure, MBS\nshall be able to receive necessary information from these legacy systems to be able to ensure safe\nmovements inside its Area of Control (AoC). A major interface that needs to be established is the\ninterfaces for adjacent interlockings and RBCs to ensure a safe handover. The integration of legacy\nTraffic Management Systems (TMS), control systems and object controllers have to be analysed as\nwell for migration purposes. Therefore, requirements have to be identified and exported to these\nsystems so that adapter solutions can be developed to connect them to MBS. MBS itself shall ideally\nonly communicate to another MBS and the systems specified in the target Traffic CS architecture\ndefined by the System Pillar. Legacy systems have to be adapted in order to communicate with MBS.\nNote: The interface for handover to and from a legacy system (see also chapter 3.1.1) is out of scope\nfor R2EDATO Phase 1 and will thus be excluded in the following subchapters. The scope of R2EDATO\nPhase 2 is not yet specified.\n\n5.2 SYSTEM OPERATING CONDITIONS AND CONSTRAINTS\nThe following operating constrains apply to MBS:\n\n- Operation with national ATP is not possible\n- No light signalling is supported (with the potential exception of transition areas).\n\nThere are several operating conditions that apply to MBS:\n\n- MBS supports ETCS Level 2. Flexible migration of fleets concerning the ETCS equipment\nhave to be considered, e.g., handling of different ETCS versions, functions and non-equipped\ntrains.\n\n- Trains that deliver their train integrity and safe train length information to MBS as well as\ntrains that do not send this information have to be supported.\n\n- The aim is a minimum or no manual interaction between driver and signaller.\n\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 21 of 28 06/06/2025\nInterne",

Furthermore, the logical handling of\nall movements is the same, meaning that there is no distinction between shunting routes and\ntrain routes anymore. The setting and protection of any kind of train/vehicle movement\n(scheduled or not) is executed with the same set of functions that only change parameters\naccording to the intended movement on the track. However, this does not mean, that the\noperational process of shunting (e.g., in the mode SH or SM) will not be necessary or is\nplanned to be eliminated. Only the technical implementation in MBS is referred to in this\noperational condition.\n- MBS is applicable for different types of railways lines (regional, low density, urban, main line,\nhigh speed).\n- The loading and activation of Domain Data to MBS is possible during MBS’ runtime. Thus,\nMBS shall be independent from Domain Data update and change lifecycles.\n5.3 SYSTEM MAINTENANCE CONDITIONS\nThe maintenance strategy provides the use of IT deployment strategies like continuous integration\nbased on reliable automatic configuration and test procedures. This enables a faster adaptation of\nthe infrastructure to operational needs than today. This includes the update of infrastructure data,\ne.g., topology data update without restarting MBS, as well as other configuration data. MBS should\nsupport the development of easily maintainable solutions e.g., with a feasible degree of modularity,\nthus reducing the maintenance effort for the staff e.g., changing the configuration of the system,\ninstalling updates, etc.\nNote: The physical aspects of maintenance are out of scope for now, thus e.g., changing of\nhardware, cabling etc. is not considered.\nRegarding the interface with actor Maintenance Staff, the necessity of an HMI has to be analysed\nfurther during system specification. This interface will exclude some maintenance functionalities like\nthe activation of Domain Data as this is coordinated by the interfacing system Digital Register.\n5.4 LOGISTIC SUPPORT CONSIDERATIONS\nPhysical architecture of the system is out of scope. Thus, no considerations about logistic support.\n5.5 REVIEW OF PAST EXPERIENCE DATA FOR SIMILAR SYSTEMS\nThe general experience with a substantial subset of today's interlockings (IXL) is that there is no\nstandardised interface to it which causes a lot of project engineering and development effort in\ninterfacing systems. Oftentimes, the interfacing systems, like for example the control system, needs\ndetailed knowledge about the behaviour of the IXL to properly command it. Every change of the IXL’s\nbaseline leads to changes of all interfacing systems as they have to support new/changed\nfunctionalities. High coordination effort to align the rollout and migration of all the affected railway\nsystems, e.g., control system, Radio Block Centre (RBC), TMS and track worker safety systems, is\nneeded. This is not only costly and prone to compatibility issues, but also significantly prolongs\nproject durations.\nA more specific example is the operation with ETCS. Due to the fact that the OPE TSI has a lot of\nnon-harmonised rules, major differences remain in the implementation of the same operational\nprocesses in different countries. This is due to the freedom of choice and application of the trackside\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 22 of 28 06/06/2025\nInterne",

Additionally, differences arise from the\nuse of different class B systems. But even if the application of the TSI is chosen (i.e., ETCS), there\nappear to be differences in the implementation and rules of operational processes. Also, this\n“loophole” to use NTC/STM when implementing ETCS ultimately delays the rollout and operation\nwith ETCS. An example for this can be seen in the complex integration projects, e.g., for Abellio with\n3 national ATPs and ETCS integrated on-board.\nThe integration of ETCS also depends on the used interlocking. For example, when entering an\noccupied track. Today, this is sometimes done in mode OS, sometimes done in SR or even in SH.\nIn most cases, the difference is due to differences in the functionality of the interlocking which is\nused. Also, with relatively modern interlockings, which can support OS, SR or SH is implemented\nnonetheless.\nNote: EULYNX [2] is excluded from consideration here because there are no implementations of\nthis standard yet in operation.\n5.6 INFLUENCE ON OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL, PASSENGERS\nAND PUBLIC\nThere is no influence on passengers and public expected besides safety by design.\nAs the new system MBS needs to be maintained throughout its lifecycle, new maintenance\nprocedures and protocols are to be expected. From a hardware perspective, MBS components shall\nbe able to run on anew safe computing platform (standardised by the System Pillar). The deployment\non existing legacy hardware through e.g., emulation, can be analysed in a later specification level.\nThe MBS is expected to influence the operational procedures and conditions at least regarding the\navailable automated assistance for operational personnel, new procedures for Level 2 operation in\ncompliance with the ETCS Specifications [1] and for entering an occupied track. Therefore, it has to\nbe specified how MBS is supporting and managing operation and what is needed on the operational\nside of things. The operational procedures to handle MBS shall not include business “logic” but be\nbased on necessary issues, not on national particularities/sensitivities.\nNote: The definition of the exact operational procedures is out of scope, because this is within the\nscope of operational harmonisation in the System Pillar.\nIn order to use the MBS, training as well as operating manuals have to be provided to the railway\nstaff.\n5.7 DESCRIPTION OF OPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe operation of MBS requires operating procedures as well as maintenance procedures. Similar to\nEULYNX, there is an “operating mode” and “maintenance mode” of the system envisioned. If the\nsystem enters “maintenance mode”, procedures for system installation, loading of new software data\nand configurations can proceed. The maintenance mode as well the start of the procedures can be\nactivated either manually by e.g., actor Maintenance Staff, or automatically by an external actor e.g.,\nPlan Execution (PE) for planned maintenance. The transition to the “operating mode” of the system\nis only possible after a successful system test activating the changes made to the system during\nmaintenance. Either MBS does the system test autonomously or/and in interaction with local staff\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 23 of 28 06/06/2025\nInterne",

For example, the loss of train integrity monitoring on-board might trigger an\nemergency reaction first. After the train integrity is assessed once more, the train can continue in\ndegraded situations with localisation by Trackside Train Detection (TTD).\nAs a general principle, the handling of degraded situation shall be automated as much as possible.\nThis means that the operator shall intervene when a degraded situation can’t be handled by rules\n(interplay between PE and MBS). In order to ensure safety, the human ability to judge and assess a\nsituation is needed either by technical means or through legal obligation.\nFP2-T13_1-D-GTD-005-07 Page 24 of 28 06/06/2025\n\nInterne",

Therefore, as long as there is no separate Glossary\ndocument available, care must be taken to keep the definitions synchronised.\n\nAllocation Section Allocation Sections express gauge clearance conflicts between different\ntracks.\n\nFor example, Allocation Sections are associated to the representation of\nswitchable Track Assets and further track connections like diamond\ncrossings.\n\nThe Allocation Sections are used in terms of granting a Movement\nPermission request as condition for clearance in a certain area.\n\nSee also /FlankProtection/\n\nArea of Control (AoC) | The Area of Control is the topologically limited extent used here for\ndefining the technical and operational responsibility of one instance of\nMBS.\n\nDomain Data The Domain Data refers to use case specific configuration data for the\nMBS to define the specific application. These can be broadly classified\nas Map Data, Segment Profiles, and Parameter Data. As a part of\nconfiguration process, the MBS needs Domain Data. Potential updates\nof Domain Data will be realised by a centralised provisioning process incl.\nsynchronous activation of the new data version.\n\nSource: /SD1DM/\n\nDomain Object A Domain Object is an abstract object for which a Domain (e.g. Moving\nBlock System) has the main responsibility. There might be other Domains\nwho are consumers of this object as well. In general, it is based on or\nlinked to the Domain Data.\n\nDrive Protection A Drive Protection Section is a linear contiguous stretch of track with a\n\nSection (DPS) driveability (passage possible yes/no) state.\nA Drive Protection Section (DPS) represents a Track Edge Section that\ncan be brought to different driveability states to ensure the driveability or\nsafety of a track route. As such, it is an abstraction for any location on the\nrailway network that may adopt different states due to Switchable\nTrackside Asset (e.g. points or level crossings).\nSource: RCA\n\nFP2-T13_ 2-D-ALS-003-10 Page 8 of 197 07/07/2025\n\nInterne",

MBS therefore acts in a server role which means that PE\nestablishes the communication to the server (MBS).\n\ne OBU: It initiates the communication as MBS won't know all trains in its area until they connect\n(/ETCS/ - SUBSET-026 §3.5.3.4 of /ETCS/).\n\nMBS also supervises the communication so it can react to a loss of communication.\nIf MBS is the session initiator, it means whenever a supervision function of MBS detects that there\nis no communication, it establishes a communication (which might be the very first establishment at\nstart of MBS or a re-establishment after a communication loss):\nFP2-T13_ 2-D-ALS-003-10 Page 27 of 197 07/07/2025\nInterne",

This may be necessary for the operational scenarios “Joining”\nor to reschedule train movements.\n\nGoal After receiving a cooperative shortening request indicating that it is\nrequested to cooperatively shorten the MA from PE, MBS checks all\nsafety constraints and subsequently performs the cooperative\nshortening of MA with the OBU.\n\n[Precondition me OSS\n\nPostcondition (Success) After the OBU has accepted the new MA and has informed MBS about\nthis, the MBS has updated the Movement Permission and informs PE\nabout the success of the cooperative shortening of MA procedure.\n\nPostcondition Failure 1:\n\n(Failure) After the OBU has rejected the new MA and has informed MBS about\nthis, the MBS informs PE about the failure of the cooperative\nshortening of MA procedure.\n\nThe previously received MA remains valid on-board.\nFailure 2:\nThe MBS has rejected the Cooperative Shortening Request.\ne PE\n\nthat it is requested to co-operatively shorten the MA.\n\nMain Sequence 1. When all checks are successful, then MBS indicates this to PE and\nsubsequently sends a Request to Shorten MA message to the OBU\nbased on the Cooperative Shortening Request received from PE.\n\n2. When MBS receives the Request to shorten MA is granted message\nfrom the OBU, then MBS indicates this to the PE. Subsequently the\nTrain Object (including the Movement Permission) is updated and\nPE is also informed about that.\n\n[Alternate Sequence [Nowe OSS\n1.a) When at least one check is not successful, then the MBS indicates\nthis to PE. The co-operative shortening of MA procedure is aborted.\n\nFailure Sequence\n2.a) When MBS receives the Request to shorten MA rejected message\nshortening of MA procedure is finished.\n\nComments\n\nTable 9 — Description of SysC: Revoke MA cooperatively by PE\n5.15.1 Scenario: Revoke MA cooperatively by PE\nFP2-T13 2-D-ALS-003-10 Page 55 of 197 07/07/2025\nInterne",

This STPA focuses on “unsafe control actions” in control and feedback loops within\ncomplex systems. An advantage over previous methods is the potential to identify emergent risks\nstemming from the interaction between those (sub)systems, which are often overlooked.\nThe subject of this analysis is the “Moving Block System” (MBS) that is being defined and specified\nin WP13. The figure below shows its localization within the planned Moving Block Demonstrator\n(MBD) from WP44/45. In this preliminary architecture it is foreseen that the MBS receives its topology\nmodel (Domain Data) from an entity designated as Digital Register (DR). Various commands and\nrequests (e.g., requests to move a point/request to grant a movement permission) come from the\nPlan Execution (PE) that executes the operational plan from the Traffic Management System (TMS).\nOn the other side, MBS facilitates communication with and also commands the Onboard-Units (OBU)\nand Trackside Asset Control & Supervision (TACS) — aka trackside object controllers.\nTimetable\n| | Trackside-CS ,\nLxecute Operational (SuT) '\nCS MBS\nFf [seve | :\n56.026, $037 —_ ‘uy,\nS ES\n本全 [PT |\n_ aE\noc oc oc\nFigure 1: Localization of MBS within a simplified view of “moving block” trackside CS\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 14 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

Since we apply “moving block principles”, movement authorities can therefore be\nissued up to any point on the track, and trains can safely follow each other in absolute braking\ndistance without being bound to wait for the next block section to become free. However, the system\nshall still be able to utilize information from previously installed Train Detection Systems (TDS) to\ncomplement and improve localization information where applicable (e.g. if receiving a OBU radio\ntransmission takes longer than receiving occupation information from the TDS), and/or for migration\npurposes. Some advantages of the new system are:\n\ne potential performance gains due to smaller train headway times.\n\ne reduced efforts for TDS and obsolete lineside signals (cab side signaling).\n\ne the merger of interlocking and RBC functionality, that enables the MBS system to even\n\nconsider physical trains (since traditional IXL was only concerned about securing routes).\ne the concentration of safety related functions into as few “safety-critical” components as\npossible (thereby reducing the SIL requirement for other components).\n\ne the (envisaged) capability of runtime configuration updates.\n\ne (envisaged) improved supplier independence due to open/fully defined interfaces.\nMBS is thus by design “the component performing safety related functions” within this novel trackside\nCS. The implications of this approach on overall system safety are of great interest.\nPrevious investigations were focused on train localization (performance), radio communication\n(performance and availability), cold movement detection, as well as train length- and train integrity\ndata. Ideally, the safety requirements from there can be mapped to the new results. However, a\nfocus of this analysis are the control (inter-)actions and feedback between the adjacent systems\n(e.g., what are the main hazards that emerge from command and feedback loop between MBS and\na safety operator panel).\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 15 of 104 07/07/2025\n\nInterne",

It is based on the STPA analysis method for the current safety analysis and considers the\nresult from the former X2Rail project. The STPA analysis proved to be the most suitable method at\na time, when the system requirements and the system design were still subject to significant\nchanges. Like in traditional safety methods, the efforts involved are highly dependent on the level of\ndepth to which the STPA shall be conducted, and since the task resources are limited (due to overall\nWP allocation as well as due to the number of active authors) an adaptive approach is applied. While\nthe whole system-stack involved in “command control & signaling” shall be covered at a high\nabstraction level, certain points of interest (e.g., where valuable information for feedback to the\nspecification task can be generated) can be investigated on a lower abstraction level, down to\nindividual control/feedback telegrams.\nThe analysis does not provide all the evidence to obtain certification or to fulfil the mandatory\nrequirements or design standards (e.g.: EN50126-1 and -2, EN50128, EN50129, EN50159, ...).\nHowever, it will define safety related design recommendations which shall be considered during the\ndevelopment of the MBS and may be mapped to safety requirements in a later stage.\nThe overall analysis of the whole Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) as depicted in Figure 1 below\nis covered in WP44/45 (Task 45.5.).\n\n2.1 SYSTEM BOUNDARY\nAs briefly described in the introduction, the system boundary of MBS is defined through interfaces\nwithin the Moving Block Demonstrator (MBD) (e.g., |_ PE, |_ DR) and also to the outside of the MBD\n(e.g., | TACS, |_ TACS). Even though similar definitions have already been produced within Task\n13.1, 13.2 and 44.3 we decided to reproduce (copy/update/rewrite) such a section here — at least\nuntil the documents from these tasks are in a stable version. Within this section there is also a\ndescription of all the subsystems depicted in the drawing below. Relevant Interface descriptions can\nbe found in chapter 6 Interface Criticality together with a preliminary analysis of the interface\ncriticality. The handover to neighboring systems is out of scope for this analysis.\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 16 of 104 07/07/2025\n\nInterne",

Even\nthough some aspects of the larger demonstrator (MBD) architecture have to be taken into account,\nthe target of this safety analysis is the Moving Block System (MBS). The analysis is partly based on\noutputs from predecessor projects, such as X2Rail and RCA, but it also relies on inputs from system\npillar, as well as the results from connected tasks within R2ZDATO.\nThe envisaged goal for the demonstrator (MBD) is TRL (Technology Readiness Level) 6 [20]. At this\nstage, the complete safety analysis is qualitative only, not quantitative. Quantitative methods, such\nas fault trees to verify specific safety objectives, may be added in a later stage when a higher TRL\nshall be achieved.\nFigure 3 shows the scope of the safety analysis in the so called “hourglass model” from CENELEC\nEN 50126-2.\nA » System Definition\n» Risk Analysis, including:\ne Consequence Analysis\ne Selection of RAP\n7 Risk Evaluation\nSafety-\nAnalysis\nR ~—\n> System Requirements Specification | oo\n>” List or identitiea nazards witn\nassociated safety measures\n> Safety Requirements:\ne elected Codes of Fractice\n« Objectives from ERE\n« Reference systems specifications\nCc TM!_\n» Hazard Analysis\ne Causal Analysis\ne Hazard Identification\n(refinement)\ne Common Cause Analysis\n» Demonstration of Compliance\nFigure 3 — Safety Analysis in Relation to the Hourglass Model\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 23 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

This means that the standards will\nbe taken as a major input for the development, but some requirements may be interpreted in a more\nrelaxed way as it would be the case for a fully operational system.\n4.3 STPA\nThe STPA handbook [1] describes the practical application of STPA in great detail. Here, we only\nprovide a very short description and the reason why STPA was chosen.\nSTPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a method to identify hazards and related system\nconstraints in complex systems, in order to identify (unsafe) control actions that lead to those hazards\n(and related losses). Mitigations to avoid these unsafe control actions can then be derived.\nThe reason why STPA was chosen is that it is geared towards large and complex systems with\nmultiple interactions, where hazards do not necessarily only arise due to component failures, but\nalso due to emergent behavior involving multiple components. The MBS (especially in combination\nwith its interfaces and interactions with the environment) is a novel system, for which this method is\nbelieved to be of great value.\n5 RISK ANALYSIS\nThis chapter details and documents the results of the conducted STPA analysis as described in\nchapter 4.3. The analysis focuses on the marked section of the “hourglass model” from CENELEC\nEN 50126-2 as shown in Figure 3 which is intended to derive the safety requirements from operator\npoint of view. These requirements must be considered by the suppliers of an MBS system. The\nsupplier's safety analysis shall consider these requirements as their safety goals, that can be broken\ndown into further sub safety goals and requirements.\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 24 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

The purpose of the\nanalysis is to find possible causes for accidents. An accident is defined as an undesired or unplanned\nevent that results in a loss. A loss always involves something of value to the stakeholder. Typical\nexamples are loss of human life or injury, but also property damage, environmental pollution or loss\nof mission. [1] For this analysis, three main losses are considered:\nLegend of the following table:\nID ... a unique identifier\nName ... a description of the loss\nL-1 Loss of life or injury to people on the train (including injury because of incorrect\nbraking technique without derailment or collision)\n¢ Passengers\n¢ Railway staff (crew on the train)\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 25 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

Within STPA, a hazard is defined\nas “a system state or set of conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case environmental\nconditions, will lead to a loss” [1]. Note that this definition differs from the classical definition of a\nhazard. It is essential that hazards are defined at system level instead of component level, as\nhazards may also arise from the interaction between components and cannot necessarily be\nassigned to a single component.\nA system is defined as “a set of components that act together as a whole to achieve some common\ngoal, objective, or end” [1]. It may contain subsystems and the analysis may be based higher or\nlower level of abstraction of individual subsystems as needed.\nIn order to identify system level hazards, it is therefore necessary to identify the system under\nconsideration and the analysis boundary as defined in chapter 2.1 System Boundary. A useful way\nto define the analysis boundary may be to include only systems within the analysis boundary over\nwhich the system designers have some form of control.\nTo ease readability the hazards are described in a generic form. Each hazard may have multiple\nsub-hazards, further detailing the high-level hazard.\nThe hazards differentiate between losses in connection with other trains and hazards in connection\nwith “other obstacles”. For the purposes of this analysis, runaway trains are regarded as “other\nobstacles\".\nLegend of the following table:\nID ... a unique identifier\nName ... a description of the unsafe condition\nID Losses .... associated losses\ni\n\nTrain does not maintain safe distance to other trains (front, back, | [L-1]\n\nflank)\n[H-1.1] | Train deceleration is insufficient\nFP2-T13_ 3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 26 of 104 07/07/2025\n\nInterne",

The train is initially at standstill, and both consists are unpowered and coupled and no TTDs\nare located at the track. The consists T1a and T1b are uncoupled while the train is powered off. The\ndriver enters the cab of T1a, opens the desk and enters the validated train data. He mistakenly\nbelieves that T1b is still coupled and inputs the total of T1a and T1b as train length into the DMI. As\nthe consist T1a is still integer, the TIMS reports integrity confirmed. When PE requests an MA for\nT1a from MBS, MBS mistakenly believes that a train with a length of T1 is moved, while in reality\ntrain T1b is still standing on the tracks. As a result, after releasing the MA behind T1a, MBS grants\nanother train T2 a MA into the region where T1b is still standing, leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-\n16]\n=> [SDR-11]: MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected (i.e. due to\nsplitting and joining).\n[S2-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 with length LEN1 is initially at standstill and located on track TR1. T1 is\nnot equipped with a functioning TIMS and no TTDs are available for TR1. The driver opens the desk\nand enters the validated train data. Due to operational changes, additional cars have been added to\nthe train. The driver enters a too short train length LEN2, because he is not aware that the train is\nlonger than during normal operations. As he is already behind schedule and there are visual\nobstructions blocking his view to the end of the train, the driver confirms the train integrity without\nseeing the last train cars. Therefore, MBS mistakenly believes T1 has length LEN2, which is shorter\nthan the real train length LEN1, and grants an MA to T1 based on LENZ. As a result, after releasing\nthe MA behind T1, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into the region where 171 is still standing,\nleading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]\n\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 59 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

The\ntrain is powered down and no TTDs are available for this section of the track. After applying the\nparking brakes, the railway personal does not add the brake shoes below the wheels. Therefore,\nafter the air pressure is no longer sufficient to keep the train at standstill, T1 starts to move towards\nthe bottom of the valley and is now located at L2. MBS mistakenly believes that T1 is still located at\nits last known location L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L2, leading to a collision\n[UCA-MBS-16]\n=> [SDR-13]: In regions where the parking of vehicles is expected, methods for detecting the\npresence of trains independent of train position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these\nregions)\n[S4-UCA-MBS-16] Train T1 is initially at standstill and located at L1. T1 is in no power mode and no\nTTDs are available. The driver opens the desk and enters the validated train data. The OBU does\nnot know the current train position. The driver therefore tells the operator the train position, and\nrequests a staff responsible movement authorization. However, as the driver cannot see the track\nkilometer board due to visual obstructions, he mistakenly reports the wrong train position L2 to the\noperator. The operator permits a train movement based on a L2, while the train is in reality located\nat L1. As a result, MBS grants another train T2 a MA into L1, leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]\n=> [SDR-14]: When moving a train based on a train position transmitted by the driver, the operator\nshall perform additional validity checks from a second source (i.e. planned start location of the train)\nbefore granting a SR authorization.\n[S5-UCA-MBS-16]: Light Maintenance vehicle M1 is powered off and located at L1 on track TR1.\nTR1 is equipped with a track circuit TTD1, which is unable to detect the maintenance vehicle M1. At\nMBS initialization, TTD1 is reported as clear. Therefore, MBS is unaware of the presence of M1 at\nL1. As a result, MBS grants another train T1 a MA into L1, leading to a collision [UCA-MBS-16]\n=> [SDR-15]: When the presence of maintenance vehicles is expected, track circuits alone should\nnot be sufficient to clear the track, if these circuits can miss occupations by some vehicle types (i.e.\nlight maintenance vehicles). Note: This may adversely impact operational performance at system\nstartup or when clearing areas previously occupied by maintenance vehicles.\n[S1-UCA-MBS-17] Train T1 is at standstill and located at the left track of railway point P1. The\nreported train length of LEN1 or T1 is shorter than the physical train length LEN2. Therefore, MBS\nmistakenly assumes that T1 is outside the fouling point of P1. As a result, MBS grants another train\nT2 a MA over P1, leading to a flank collision between T1 and T2 [UCA-MBS-17]\n=> see [SDR-12]\n[S2-UCA-MBS-17] Unsupervised area UA1 is reachable via the left track of railway point P1. Train\nT1 is located in UA1, and neither the UA1 nor the tracks of P1 are equipped with TTDs.

Track TR2 runs parallel to TR1. If fully extended, the crane arm of M1\ncan reach into the maximum permitted clearance gauge TR2. Because worksite W1 is located on\nTR1, MBS mistakenly believes this worksite cannot affect trains running on TR2.

As a result, a train is authorized to enter the side track and collides with the buffer\nstop.\n-> [SDR-21] An operational rule may be required, that ensures that any infrastructure changes have\nto be preceded by a (sufficiently large & restrictive) URA, and that this URA may only be lifted if the\nchanges have been updated in the topography & configuration data of MBS.\n[S1-UCA-DR-11] For some reason it was decided that domain data should be updated before the\nactual construction work on the tracks took place. To secure the area where track changes will occur\na URA was foreseen. However, MBS was not commanded to activate this URA before the following\ntopology/domain data update. Since MBS has no means of deciding if such a URA would have been\nrequired it activates the new domain data version right away. Subsequently. MBS allows a train to\nmove into the site with a higher velocity than allowed for safe operation. .\n=> [SDR-24] If an URA for safe activation of new set of domain data is required the domain data\nshall include the reference for this URA (e.g. by means of a dedicated safety code).\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 68 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

Although these enriched\nrecommendations should be self-explanatory, it might make sense to look up the linked\n(hypothetical) scenarios for each, that led to unsafe control actions in the chapters above.\n\n8.1 UNSAFE CONTROL ACTIONS TOWARDS ON BOARD UNIT\n=>[SDR-13]: In regions where the parking of vehicles is expected, methods for detecting the\npresence of trains independent of train position reports shall be available (i.e. installing TTDs in these\nregions)\n\nRationale Uncontrolled train movements, like runaway cars after parking, are not constrained by a\n\nmovement authority. Such a scenario is described in [S3-UCA-MBS-16]\n\n=> [SDR-16]: Between controlled region and unsupervised region, the movement of non-\n\ncommunicating trains shall be detectable, i.e. using TTDs, or preventable using a point/derailer\n\n(similar to [SDR-13])\n\nRationale Detecting or preventing the presence of uncontrolled trains out of unsupervised regions\n\n(e.g. at the borders of the region of control) is needed for assumption 2. A corresponding scenario\n\nis described in [S2-UCA-MBS-17].\n\n=> [SDR-18] Simple detection of track occupation is not sufficient to prevent flank collisions in all\n\ncases. Technical means to secure a sufficiently large vacant area before the fouling point is required.\n\nRationale Even when the train presence is detected according to assumption 1., the reaction times\n\ncan be insufficient to prevent a flank collision hazard, making further measures necessary:\n\n=> [ASM-4-v2] MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train movement but supports them for\n\nmigration purposes or systems where the chance of uncontrolled movement cannot be sufficiently\n\ncontrolled by other means.\n\nRationale The assumption that TTDs can completely be eliminated while still guarding against all\n\nloss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong.

The neighbouring system is specified in the name of the interface\n(e.g.: | DR is the interface between the MBS and the DR). An analysis with respect to the correctness\nand integrity of the data as well as the availability of the connection was also conducted for each\ninterface. The following interface are listed as safety related: | AS, | OBU, |_ OP, | TACS.\nChapter 7 “Mapping of X2Rail Safety Analysis” covers the safety analysis results [X2RAIL-5] of the\nproject X2RAIL to ensure that they are adequately considered in this analysis. This is done by\nanalyzing each hazard from the X2Rail results and by providing a trace to different artefacts of the\nSTPA analysis. It can be stated that the X2RAIL results - where applicable (not bound to a S2R\nspecific solution) - are fully covered by the artifacts (e.g. assumptions, design recommendations,\ninterface analysis, ...) from this task.\nChapter 8 “Compiled Design Recommendations’ contains the results of the risk analysis in Chapter\n5 above, supplemented with rationale, guidance & example statements where applicable. Although\nthese enriched recommendations should be self-explanatory, it makes sense to look up the linked\nunsafe control actions in the chapters above. They describe how such a hypothetical scenario could\nhave occurred and form the background for the recommendations.\n9.2 STARTING POINT\nThe basis for this analysis was the rough system architecture that is baked into the grant agreement\nas well as various sources from previous projects (see chapter 3). However, essential inputs from\nsystem pillar were not available at the time. Thus, an own list of assumptions (see chapter 5.5) was\ncreated, compared, mapped, and supplemented with a similar list from the system definition task\n(13.1). Similarly, the operational context was rather compiled and derived from state-of-the-art\nprocedures in the participating railway companies than given from the normative side. Another factor\nshaping the work in this task, were the resources at hand, and the parallelized work structure given\nthrough the grant agreement.\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 100 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

But the missing inputs were substituted from other sources as stated in 9.2. The\nresults of this task can conversely serve as input for the ongoing discussion in the system pillar.\nDue to limited time and resources, the authors decided to focus on system hazards, by analyzing\nthe control interactions between the moving block system and the systems with which it interfaces\ndirectly. The chosen method is explained and exemplified in chapter 5.\nWe expect that the results can be utilized to update the system concepts, the system definition as\nwell as the operational context and then further the system specification for the continuing innovation\npillar work on the Moving Block Demonstrator. Some of the results can also be exported adjacent\nwork packages, like WP27 where the Digital Register is being specified, or to the demonstrator work\npackages WP44/45 where operational concepts, and an operator console/workbench will come into\nplay.\nEven though a proof of completeness with respect to functional safety is not in part of this task, we\nwere able to show that we cover the whole set of results from X2Rail safety work in chapter 7.\n9.4 DISCUSSION OF MAIN RESULTS\nAn advantage of the chosen approach was that it allowed to connect the beforehand stated\nassumptions with the relevant loss scenarios they affect. Some of the used assumptions were well\nestablished (e.g., the SIL classification of the OBU, OCs), while others were relatively novel (e.g.,\nFP2-T13 3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 101 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",

The safety analysis therefore provided an\nopportunity to validate or - if necessary - update these assumptions.\nFor example, under the assumption that TTDs are not required ([ASM-4]), we generated loss\nscenarios for the relevant unsafe control actions to see if the hazard could still be prevented. This is\nclosely connected to two further assumptions about MBS:\n1. Up to date knowledge of all (potential) train positions on the tracks\n2. Ability to constrain all train movement within a known area (i.e., movement authority)\nThe respective set of loss scenarios (concerning runaway wagons, loss of communication, parking\nvehicles and so on) led to the specific design recommendations [SDR-13], [SDR-16] & [SDR-18].\nThe summary of those in turn leads to the conclusion, that the assumption that TTDs can completely\nbe eliminated while still guarding against all loss scenarios found in our analysis is too strong. In\nshort, if uncontrolled train movement cannot be eliminated, their presence is still required.\nHenceforth, [ASM-4] was updated to [ASM-4-v2] “MBS does not require TTDs for controlled train\nmovement but supports them for migration purposes or systems where the chance of uncontrolled\nmovement cannot be sufficiently controlled by other means.”\nA second class of assumptions is concerned with the correspondence between reported data and\nphysical reality. This includes assumptions about the reported train length ([ASM-8]) as well as the\ngeographical position of infrastructure elements like points, tracks, etc. ([ASM-26]). For train length,\npartial validation is possible in the case of splitting or joining trains. However, the validation alone\nmay not be sufficient to achieve the desired level of confidence required for a SIL 4 function (e.g., if\ntwo trains enter the same TTD section and maneuvers like joining, splitting, or turning take place).\nThus [SDR-11] states that “MBS shall always be aware when a change of train length is expected\n(i.e. due to splitting and joining).”\nThe correctness of information on the geographical position of infrastructure elements is even more\ncritical for MBS. Some controller constraints depend on geometrical information (e.g. ensuring that\nthere are no intersections between movement authorities, [Resp-MBS-1]) which need the required\nlevel of precision to ensure that no intersections are undetected. MBS lacks the information to\nvalidate the provided information by itself, but depends on it for SIL-4 functions. Thus, the\ncorresponding assumption [ASM-26] has the rank of exported requirement, provided in a higher level\nof granularity through the design recommendations [SDR-18] to [SDR-24].\nThe third class of results concerns the control loops where a human actor is involved. Several design\nrecommendations in section 8.4 concern the Operator Panel, its ability to display safety related\ninformation, to re-verify human entered values, to schedule safety related commands, or more\ngeneral operational procedures that could be linked to respective loss scenarios in our analysis.\n9.5 OPEN POINTS AND FUTURE WORK\nEven though the major pain points were likely highlighted in this analysis, they are not yet verifiably\nsettled or solved. In that regard, the design recommendations will have to be considered in the\nsystem definitions of MBS, DR and the Operator Panel - to be then re-checked/validated in a further\nFP2-T13_3-T-DBA-044-05 Page 102 of 104 07/07/2025\nInterne",
